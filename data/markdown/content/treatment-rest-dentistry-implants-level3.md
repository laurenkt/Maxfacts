<p>Not all missing teeth need to be replaced and it should be considered
    carefully whether an implant is indicated. The need to replace
    a tooth will depend on whether function is affected (for
    example mastication and phonation), aesthetics, or both.
    An advantage of implants is that they do not damage existing
    tooth structure, provided they are placed appropriately.</p>
<p>Implant placement has associated risks including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>failure to osseointegrate and lack of stability;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a> such as
        peri-implantitis;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">bone necrosis</a>        in people with a history of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        or use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive medications</a>,
        in particular <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>;</li>
    <li>bleeding;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">nerve damage</a>;</li>
    <li>sinus problems (due to protrusion of implant into sinus);</li>
    <li>accidental damage to adjacent teeth and structures;</li>
    <li>very rarely <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">mandible fracture</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">necrosis</a>        of surrounding flap tissue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of implants are made of titanium. However, there
    are multiple surface modifications such as the addition of
    fluorides, integration of calcium phosphate microcrystals
    (such as calcium hydroxyl apatite coatings), to improve osseointegration
    of the implant. Osseointegration is the direct structural
    bond between the implant surface and jaw bone, with no soft
    tissue or periodontal ligament connections between the two.</p>
<p>Planning of the implant is a crucial stage of the process. As
    well as a thorough initial examination, imaging will be necessary,
    with a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray/detailed">cone beam computed tomogram (CBCT) scan</a>    being the gold standard.</p>
<p>Active <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontitis and even treated periodontitis</a>    increase the risk of post-operative peri-implantitis, therefore
    caution should be exercised in this patient group. Ideally,
    all active disease in the mouth should be stabilized prior
    to implant treatment.</p>
<p>Following the decision for an implant to be placed, the type
    of implant needs to be chosen. Implants range in length from
    short (less than 9 mm), standard (10 mm) to long (more than
    10 mm), with most systems providing lengths of 4 mm to over
    20 mm. The length of the implant selected will depend on
    its purpose, bone availability and anatomical features. Most
    implants will include an anti-rotation device. There are
    advantages and disadvantages of each type of implant; this
    discussion is beyond the remit of this website.</p>
<p>The position of the implant is determined by considering occlusion,
    position of adjacent teeth, the planned prosthesis, anatomical
    features and bone levels (a bone graft, gingival graft or
    sinus lift may be required for example). The dental laboratory
    may help determine this, or the use of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scanning</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/maths/3d-image">CAD/CAM three-dimensional planning and printing techniques</a>    if planning the implant digitally. A surgical guide may be
    produced (known as a stent). Whilst not used by all surgeons,
    these can help in ensuring the correct positioning of the
    final implant.</p>
<p>An intra-osseous channel is drilled into the bone, compressing
    the bone and creating a surface with a reduced vasculature
    and some cell necrosis. Constant temperature control by irrigation
    and the use of ultra-slow drilling speeds are crucial at
    this step in the process. The implant is then inserted into
    the prepared channel. Once the implant is screwed or pressed
    in to place, a healing cap is attached and the soft tissue
    sutured back in place.</p>
<p>As the compressed surface adjacent to the implant heals, a blood
    clot forms, with the fibrin clot eventually being replaced
    with granulation tissue. This is gradually replaced with
    woven bone then lamellar bone and marrow as the site matures.
    Whilst there are some circumstances where immediate loading
    is acceptable, in general it is advised that a few months
    is given for the site to heal before the implant is loaded
    with a prosthesis. If the implant is loaded prematurely,
    connective tissue may form between the implant and the bone
    reducing osseointegration and stability of the implant. Once
    the healing period has passed (2 to 6 months depending on
    clinical situation), the implant can be exposed and a final
    prosthesis attached.</p>
<p>Implants should be closely monitored over the life of the device.
    A recall interval of 6 months is recommended, following an
    initial year of intensive monitoring.</p>
<p>The treatment may be considered to be a success if the implant
    is present and functional (able to eat, speak, taste) with
    acceptable aesthetics. There should be no pain and the surgery
    should not have resulted in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">paraesthesia</a>.
    From a clinical perspective the implant should not be mobile,
    there should not be a surrounding radiolucency in <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray images</a>,
    and there should be bone loss of no more than 1.5 mm surrounding
    the implant.</p>
<p>Radiographic review is advised at the fit of the prosthesis,
    one year after this, then bi-annually. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">Periapical radiographs</a>    should be used with a reproducible technique and a radiograph
    should be taken if the implant becomes symptomatic. Implants
    should only be debrided if clinically necessary and implant-safe
    instruments should be used, such as a titanium hand scaler.
    Ultrasonic and sonic instruments are not recommended.</p>
<p>In a maxillofacial context the use of implants can range from
    routine (as in immediate replacement of a traumatically lost
    upper central incisor), through demanding (such as rehabilitation
    of cleft lip and palate or craniofacial anomalies patients)
    to highly controversial (the use of implants to rehabilitate
    oral cancer survivors after surgical and radiotherapeutic
    interventions where there is a risk of doing more harm than
    good by attempting implant supported dental rehabilitation).
    A similar issue arises with the use of implants in patients
    taking <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>.
    While some regard very weak bisphosphonates such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">etidronate</a>    a negligible risk factor for implant placement, very few
    would risk placing them in someone receiving intravenous
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">ibandronate</a>.</p>
