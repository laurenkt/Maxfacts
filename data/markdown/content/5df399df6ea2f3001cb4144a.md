<p>Our discussion of treatment options for oral mucosal
    lesions mirrors the organisation of the corresponding
    section on the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">diagnosis
        of oral mucosal lesions</a>.</p>
<h1 id="oral-mucosal-lesions-related-to-infections">Oral mucosal lesions related to infections</h1>
<p>Oral infections are common and represent a diverse range
    of conditions, including infections specifically
    affecting the mucosa. Accordingly, bacterial, fungal and
    viral oral infections and their treatment are discussed
    in several sections of the website:</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about oral and
        maxillofacial infections and their treatments, this
        information is on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>
        and treatment options for infections, <a href="/treatment/surgery/infection">surgical</a>

<h1 id="recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis-mouth-ulcers">Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers)</h1>
<p>Recurrent mouth ulcers (Figure 1), be they minor or major
    lesions, have one aspect in common: there is
    considerable overlap between the detective work of
    arriving at a diagnosis and identifying underlying
    causes, and the resulting treatment paths.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-oral-mucosal-lesion-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A typical minor
        aphthous ulcer of the tongue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The long-term view of treatment decisions for
    <strong>minor aphthous ulcers</strong> needs to be
    backed by identification and/or exclusion of underlying
    condition(s), mostly relying on detailed <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical
        history</a> and a range of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>.
</p>
<p>Where local trauma is the cause, such as an ill-fitting
    denture or a sharp edge of a tooth, dealing with this
    mechanical irritant removes the cause for recurrent
    mouth ulcers.</p>
<p>Where an underlying condition and relation with a disease
    (see below) are identified as the cause, successful
    treatment of these conditions (after referral to the
    appropriate specialty) will resolve recurrent mouth
    ulcer problems too. Where some deficiency such as a low
    level of iron or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is identified as
    the cause, supplementing these low levels is necessary,
    in addition to further investigations about the
    underlying cause(s) for the deficiency.</p>
<p>Where aphthous ulcers occur because of a reaction to an
    irritant or allergen, avoiding known irritants/allergens
    is the best approach. The list of potential
    irritants/allergens is long, but there are some common
    causes. Examples are intolerance to gluten, to sodium
    lauryl sulfate (a common detergent and foaming agent in
    toothpastes), to some food ingredients, or to smoking.
</p>
<p>A number of drugs, including <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesics</a>,
    in particular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    (NSAIDs), a range of antihypertensive drugs (the <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-vasoconstrictor-and-vasoldilator">vasodilatory</a>
    drug nicorandil is a well-recognised example) and other
    agents for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions
    and some <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>,
    are known to cause stomatitis problems. Ideally, a drug
    causing recurrent mouth ulcers should be avoided or,
    where that is not an option, an alternative drug should
    be tried. These choices may be a delicate balancing act
    between wanted and adverse effects of a drug. There may
    be situations where there are no alternative drugs, or
    where it would not be reasonable to stop taking a
    particular drug.</p>
<p>The short-term view of the treatment / management of
    acute minor aphthous ulcers needs to focus on the
    prevention of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">superinfections</a>
    and pain relief. This typically includes the use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a>
    mouthwash and general attention to optimal <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>, a range
    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesics</a>
    (including topical applications, such as benzydamine
    mouthwash) and/or topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroid</a>
    applications such as hydrocortisone gel. The typical
    appearance of a healing aphthous mouth ulcer is depicted
    in Figure 2.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-oral-mucosal-lesion-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The slough over a
        healing aphthous ulcer of the left cheek.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Treatment schemes for <strong>major aphthous
        ulcers</strong> and <strong>herpetiform
        ulcers</strong> are essentially the same as for
    minor aphthous ulcers, but are more likely to require <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">systemic
        steroids</a> and these lesions have a higher
    probability for being a symptom of a gastrointestinal
    disorder. Treatment of oral mucosal lesions as one of
    several symptoms of <strong>Behçet’s disease</strong>
    may require potent <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">anti-inflammatory
        agents</a> such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">anti-TNF
        agents</a> (a monoclonal antibody), in joint
    treatment approaches with rheumatology and/or
    ophthalmology.</p>
<h1 id="mucositis">Mucositis</h1>
<p>Oral mucositis is a severe and painful adverse effect
    that occurs in nearly all people receiving treatment
    with <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radio-</a> and/or
    <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> for
    head and neck cancer. Severe oral mucositis also is a
    common adverse effect of chemotherapy treatment for <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/blood-malignancy">blood
        malignancies</a> and may occur after bone marrow
    transplants.</p>
<p>For the moment, there is no convincing strategy or
    treatment plan to prevent this debilitating condition
    altogether. However, some strategies may help to reduce
    severity and/or duration of oral mucositis. Treatment of
    oral mucositis in general is geared toward optimal
    management of symptoms.</p>
<p>There is circumstantial evidence that cryotherapy in the
    form of ice chips held in the mouth, may have some
    limited benefit in preventing oral mucositis from
    chemotherapy. It is thought that the low temperature
    leads to vasoconstriction and thus reduces the amount of
    cytotoxic drug(s) delivered to the oral mucosal tissue.
</p>
<p>The use of keratinocyte growth factor, palifermin (which
    stimulates tissue growth, including the oral mucosa) is
    controversial for a number of reasons, including its
    potential for promoting the growth of non-haematological
    malignancies and interference with some chemotherapy
    treatment schemes. Amistofine is a cell-protective
    agent. It is a <a href="/treatment-other-medication-delivery-level3">prodrug</a>
    which relies on a specific hydrolysis mechanism for
    activation that is likely not to be active in malignant
    cell lines, so it is considered safe as it is not likely
    to protect malignant cells from high-energy radiation
    effects. Studies have shown that amistofine can reduce
    <a href="/diagnosis-list-xeostomia-level1">xerostomia
        (dry mouth)</a> problems during head &amp; neck <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>
    treatment cycles, but there is no convincing evidence of
    long-term advantages. Amistofine has also been suggested
    as a cell-protective agent for the prevention of oral
    mucositis but there is little convincing evidence in
    support of this use.</p>
<p>Some modest evidence exists for a number of interventions
    aiming at reducing severity and duration of oral
    mucositis.</p>
<p>Sucralfate is a complex of sucrose octasulfate with
    aluminium hydroxide. It dissociates in the acidic
    stomach environment, where it subsequently forms a
    protective film on the stomach lining; sulfacrate is
    used in the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antacid">treatment
        of stomach ulcers</a>. In this form, sucralfate is
    not effective in the management of oral mucositis
    because the oral cavity is not an acidic environment.
    However, polymeric viscous paste-like preparations of
    sucralfate adhere to the oral mucosa and to oral ulcers,
    forming a protective layer and thus supporting healing.
    Making best use of the combined various available
    options for best possible relief from symptoms, for
    example could be use of benzydamine mouthwash (for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesia</a>),
    followed by chlorhexidine mouth rinse (for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">antisepsis</a>)
    and completed by the application of a sealant-gel
    preparation for prolonged protection and pain relief.
</p>
<p>Low-intensity laser-therapy, <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/lilt">LILT</a>
    is also thought to support and accelerate the healing
    process, by stimulating tissue regeneration. The
    approach uses low-intensity coherent <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">laser</a>
    light in the visible red to infrared region of the
    spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Although the
    working mechanisms are not well understood, it is
    thought that this form of ‘phototherapy’ has some
    stimulating effects on cell proliferation as well as
    some <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">anti-inflammatory</a>
    effects, and thus can support healing.</p>
<p>For a fair number of further suggested interventions
    aiming to reduce symptoms of oral mucositis, there is
    only weak, or no evidence of significant beneficial
    effects. These suggestions include topical use of honey
    or royal jelly (the hypothesis for its working mechanism
    is its high sugar content which acts as a drying agent
    on the oral mucosa and any ulcers; the high sugar
    content makes honey a double-edged sword in that it will
    also promote <a href="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3">dental
        decay</a>), aloe vera preparations, antibacterial
    lozenges, <i>lactobacillus brevis</i> lozenges (aiming
    to strengthen the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">microbiome</a>
    in the oral cavity, similar to the assumed benefits of
    probiotics on the gut flora), zinc supplements in the
    form of zinc sulfate, ZnSO<sub>4</sub> mouthwash
    (Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions are an essential mineral for the
    proliferation of epithelial cell lines). There are also
    numerous ‘alternative medicine’ suggestions for the
    management of oral mucositis, but there is no evidence
    that any of these have any benefits.</p>
<p>The core focus of current therapy and management of oral
    mucositis remains the provision of adequate <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">pain
        control</a>, the best possible maintenance of the
    oral mucosal condition, and prevention and/or treatment
    of any <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">infections</a>.
    Severe oral mucositis may make oral food intake
    temporarily impossible and necessitate a period of <a href="/help-selfhelp-non-oral-food-preamble">non-oral
        feeding</a> <i>via</i> a feeding tube. Extreme oral
    mucositis can be a treatment-limiting adverse effect of
    ongoing oncological treatment. When swallowing is
    difficult or impossible, changing the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">delivery
        method of all medications</a> from oral intake to
    other delivery methods is necessary.</p>
<p>Best possible maintenance of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a> is an
    essential contribution to limit oral mucositis, both
    keeping an appropriate daily routine at home and regular
    support by a professional oral hygienist. Use of bland
    saline mouth rinses throughout the day can provide
    symptom relief and help maintain a healthy oral
    environment. Alcohol-containing mouth rinses are not
    recommended because of the drying effect of alcohol on
    the mucosa (they are also painful).</p>
<p>Where infections occur, the usual steps for the treatment
    of oral infections, predominantly by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antimicrobial
        agents</a> are taken.</p>
<p>Topical delivery of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesia</a>
    is the desirable delivery method if adequate pain
    control can be achieved in this way and safe swallowing
    has been confirmed (so that there is no danger of
    aspiration of any of the topical agents for oral use) –
    topical delivery reduces the overall load of systemic
    drugs on the body. Topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesic
        agents</a> include viscous lidocaine-containing
    pastes, benzydamine mouthwashes, a variety of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroid</a>
    anti-inflammatory preparations, or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">morphine</a>
    mouthwash. If topical pain control is impossible or
    fails, systemic analgesia is necessary, often delivered
    intravenously or <i>via</i> transdermal patches. As with
    most pain management it has been shown that in these
    circumstances scheduled administration of analgesics is
    more effective than administration as needed.</p>
<h1 id="vesiculo-bullous-lesions-blisters">Vesiculo-bullous lesions (blisters)</h1>
<p>When <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>,
    in particular viral infections are the cause, the
    condition will either be self-limiting or any active
    treatment will address the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">infecting
        microbes</a> and management of discomfort and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">pain</a>.
</p>
<p>The other main causes for oral vesiculo-bullous lesions
    are a range of different <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">autoimmune
        disorders</a>, in need of different treatment
    schemes. Some autoimmune conditions require urgent and
    intensive treatment, often including systemic
    immunosuppression. There are two main scenarios where
    and when treatment is provided. The first point of
    contact may be an oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic,
    if oral symptoms are the only or predominantly problems.
    Otherwise, there may have been a referral from another
    specialty such as rheumatology, in order to deal with
    oral symptoms of a systemic disease.</p>
<p>In either case, and in line with the treatment of most
    autoimmune conditions, treatment modalities are usually
    a joint effort between different disciplines. The role
    of oral and maxillofacial surgery is to maintain and
    monitor oral health and integrity of the oral mucosa as
    far as possible, in addition to management of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">discomfort
        and pain</a> as the burden of oral symptoms of these
    conditions can be considerable. Maxillofacial surgery
    oversight and advice is helpful in trying to prevent
    infections and/or formation of oral ulcers. Blisters of
    the oral mucosa are easily ruptured just by the normal
    function of mouth and jaws, causing painful oral ulcers
    and infections.</p>
<p>The general treatment approaches for serious autoimmune
    conditions such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">pemphigoid
        or pemphigus vulgaris</a> typically include
    immunosuppression topically (for example, application of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroids</a>)
    and/or systemically. Not all of these conditions can be
    treated successfully with steroids, but may require
    medication schemes with <a href="/treatment-other-medication-inflammaton-level3">monoclonal
        antibodies</a> and similar targeted approaches for
    the management of different autoimmune conditions. Some
    of these conditions may be difficult to treat. Many
    different medication protocols with additional drugs
    have been suggested (and continue to be suggested) but
    there is little clear evidence that any of these
    combination-medication schemes achieve better result
    than steroids alone. However, there seems to be a shift
    of practice to consider monoclonal antibody therapies as
    the first-line treatment for some of these autoimmune
    conditions, replacing steroids as the first-line choice
    of medication in some cases.</p>
<p>Another condition, angina bullosa haemorrhagica, is not
    an autoimmune disorder but its underlying causes remain
    somewhat mysterious. Accordingly, treatment is entirely
    symptomatic, in keeping with an odd but harmless
    condition that we essentially do not understand.</p>
<h1 id="persistent-patches-and-lesions">Persistent patches and lesions</h1>
<p>Persistent white (leukoplakia), red (erythroplakia) and
    speckled (erythroleukoplakia) patches, submucous
    fibrosis (scar tissue formation beneath the mucosa) and
    some rare variants of lichen planus (see below) all
    belong to a group of oral lesions that are associated
    with variable degrees of abnormal cell growth (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia/more-info">dysplasia</a>)
    and a possibility for malignant transformation of the
    lesion. These premalignant lesions all require long-term
    monitoring and repeated decisions about surgical or
    other interventions.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about so called
        premalignant lesions and underlying abnormal cell
        growth, this information is on our pages about the
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia/detailed">diagnosis
            of dysplasia</a>; the difficulties to make clear
        and straightforward decisions about treatment
        options arising from the lack of predictability of
        the behaviour of these lesions are discussed on our

</aside>
<p><strong>Oral lichen planus</strong>, the mucosal variant
    of a common skin condition, is a chronic condition and
    requires long-term management. Oral lichen planus can be
    asymptomatic or a rather debilitating condition with a
    severe symptom burden, especially erosive and ulcerative
    forms of the condition (Figure 3). The term oral lichen
    planus covers a range of similar conditions. The
    potential of oral lichen planus for malignant
    transformation remains a matter of debate. It has been
    estimated that there may be a 1 to 3 % risk for
    malignant transformation.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-oral-mucosal-lesion-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Erosive variant
        of lichen planus of the left cheek.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chronic nature of the condition, combined with
    diagnostic difficulties, a potentially significant
    morbidity (in particular pain) and an insufficient
    understanding of the cause(s) all contribute to the need
    for patience on behalf of all involved. This situation
    also accounts for the fact that there is no widely
    agreed therapeutic approach for the management of this
    group of conditions.</p>
<p>The topical application of a number of different <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroids</a>
    remains the first-line medication scheme. This could be
    in the form of sublesional injections, but some patches
    drenched with a slow-release form of clobetasol (a
    corticosteroid) are also being tested. Failure of the
    lesions to resolve under topical treatment with steroids
    is not uncommon. In such cases, topical application of a
    different type of agent, a calcineurin inhibitor
    (immunomodulating agents that reduce inflammation) such
    as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may offer an alternative.
</p>
<p>For persistent cases that do not resolve under topical
    treatment schemes, systemic steroid therapy may be
    necessary. Other treatment schemes favour the use of <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/lilt">low-intensity
        laser therapy, LILT</a> rather than pharmacological
    drugs. Some studies have demonstrated that LILT helps
    with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">pain
        management</a>, can reduce the clinical signs of
    oral lichen plans, is similarly effective as more
    established drug treatments and avoids the adverse
    effects of, for example, systemic steroids. It remains
    to be seen if these initial findings about LILT can be
    confirmed in larger systematic and rigorous studies.
    Surgical excision combined with soft tissue grafts for
    repairing the defect has been suggested for the
    treatment of isolated but persistent oral lichen planus
    lesions and may offer an alternative treatment modality
    in some limited circumstances.</p>
<p>Similar to most of the other oral mucosal lesions
    discussed here, oral lichen planus may be triggered by
    some medications (in particular <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</a> and
    beta-blockers (agents to reduce high blood pressure have
    been associated with oral lichen planus) or by some
    local irritant(s) such as amalgam dental fillings. If
    such a cause can be identified, avoiding the cause where
    possible is the obvious way forward. The various beliefs
    of clinicians without any real evidence base can create
    conflict in this area. Some clinicians advocate removal
    of all amalgam fillings on the basis of their belief
    (justified by a very limited evidence base) that amalgam
    can cause severe oral lichen planus in some people.
    Others completely refute this (again justified by a very
    limited evidence base). One, relatively logical way
    forward would be to accept amalgam may be a cause if a
    large metal filling is associated with a prominent
    localised patch of oral lichen planus and deal with
    that.</p>
<p><strong>Frictional keratosis</strong> (caused by some
    minor local trauma) and <strong>smoker’s
        keratosis</strong> (caused by irritants <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">in tobaccos
        smoke</a>) are dealt with by simply eliminating the
    respective irritant.</p>
<h1 id="oral-cancer">Oral cancer</h1>
<p>The majority of oral mucosal lesions are benign. If,
    however, a lesion has been identified as malignant, the
    whole range of treatment schemes for oral malignancies
    will need to be considered and any decisions about the
    individually best possible treatment option(s) depend on
    type and extent of the malignancy as well as on personal
    situation and preferences.</p>
