<p>Botulinum toxin is a highly poisonous substance. It is produced
    by a commonly occurring bacterium, <i>clostridium botulinum (</i>a
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">Gram-positive, anaerobic rod</a>).
    Botulinum toxin is a powerful paralytic neurotoxin. There
    are several different types of botulinum toxin but the one
    most commonly used for medical purposes is botulinum toxin
    alpha (sometimes called botulinum toxin A).</p>
<p>All botulinum toxins work by inhibiting the release of the ubiquitous
    neurotransmitter <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a>.
    Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter that works
    at the neuromuscular junction. When acetylcholine is released
    by motor neurons, it activates the muscle. When acetylcholine
    is blocked, the muscle cannot be activated, so the muscle
    is paralysed (Figure 1). The main mechanism by which botulinum
    toxins block acetylcholine is by preventing its release from
    the vesicles at the neuronal endings.</p>

<p>Botulinum toxin also reduces or inhibits the release of inflammatory
    mediators such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP;
    a potent peptide acting as a vasodilator and involved in
    nociception (pain sensation); CGRP is thought to have role
    in in the pathophysiology of migraine), glutamate and substance
    P (another neurotransmitter peptide). This effect of botulinum
    toxin is likely to be due to its inhibitory action on both
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels in nerve endings</a>.
    In this way it influences pain transmitters in both peripheral
    and central nervous system sites, and is also thought to
    cause an increase in <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/gaba">GABA</a>    (<i>γ</i>-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter)
    release.</p>
<p>Botulinum toxin has many medicinal uses, including applications
    in the maxillofacial surgery context. Generally, it is probably
    best known for its cosmetic uses, such as reducing the appearance
    of lines and wrinkles (‘chemical facelift’, ‘botox’) all
    over face, chin and neck. For this temporary ‘fix’ to work,
    precise understanding of the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">anatomy of the mimetic muscles</a>    in the face and neck region is essential. Botulinum toxin
    is administered locally by injection(s) to the target muscle(s)
    or gland(s).</p>
<p>Botulinum toxin plays a significant role in the management of
    a many different conditions, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>strabismus (problems with coordination and synchronisation
        of eye movements; this was historically the first medical
        application of botulinum toxin);</li>
    <li>blepharospasm (involuntary tight closure of eyelids);</li>
    <li>dystonias (neurological movement disorders, affecting movement
        of the mandible (lower jaw) and temporomandibular joint
        (jaw joint), causing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus/more-info">trismus (restricted mouth opening)</a>);
         </li>
    <li>spasticity (muscles continuously contracting causing painful
        stiffness and tightness; for example, hemifacial spasms,
        or spasms of neck muscles following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        treatment in the head and neck region);</li>
    <li>chronic migraine and other forms of headaches;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">chronic</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">neuropathic pain conditions</a>,
        including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">post-herpetic neuralgia</a>,
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">trigeminal neuralgia</a>        and post-traumatic forms of neuralgia;</li>
    <li>bruxism (teeth/jaw clenching);</li>
    <li>hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating);</li>
    <li>achalasia (dysfunction of the oesophagus (gullet) muscles,
        leading to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing)</a>);</li>
    <li>hypersalivation (excessive production of saliva);</li>
    <li>gustatory sweating (excessive sweating in regions of the
        face; can occur following <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">surgery to the parotid gland</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The muscle paralysis and relaxation caused by botulinum toxin
    injections typically lasts for 8 to 16 weeks. Whilst the
    affected nerve endings are preserved, the blockage of acetycholine
    release is irreversible. Recovery of the function of the
    neuromuscular junction and muscles occurs by the growth (‘sprouting’)
    of new nerve endings and synapses. Botulinum toxin injections
    are generally well tolerated, with few adverse effects. However,
    botulinum toxin alpha has some tendency to migrate away from
    the injection site by diffusion through tissue layers. If
    that happens, temporary problems with speech, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia (swallowing)</a>    and breathing may occur after injection in certain areas
    of the head and neck region.</p>
