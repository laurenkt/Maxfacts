<p>GABA, <i>γ</i>-aminobutyric acid (Figure 1) is a messenger molecule
    involved in the transmission of signals along nerve fibres,
    a neurotransmitter. GABA is essential for the control of
    the excitability of neurons. In this role, GABA acts as an
    inhibitor to neurons. It is released in the synapse (the
    gap between two neurons) and binds to receptors on the next
    neuron along the pathway of the nerve signal. There it inhibits
    nerve signal transmission by preventing the neuron from developing
    an (electrical) action potential, necessary for the travel
    of the signal further along the nerve fibre.</p>

<p>GABA is established as the most important neurotransmitter in
    the mammalian central nervous system (the spinal cord and
    the brain). It is known that at least 40 % of inhibitory
    synaptic processing in the mammalian brain uses GABA as a
    neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>In the body, GABA is mostly synthesized from glucose (a sugar)
    via some intermediate product (glutamate), which is then
    metabolised to yield GABA. This biochemical synthesis pathway
    depends on the presence of a particular enzyme (a protein),
    which in turn requires a sufficient supply of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.
    Accordingly, a vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency can lead
    to a GABA deficiency, which can be a cause of seizures.  </p>
<p>GABA receptors on neurons are <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">channel receptors</a>.
    Upon GABA binding, the channels through the cell / neuron
    membrane undergo a conformation (shape) change. This opens
    the channel through the cell membrane and allows ions to
    pass into the cell. It has been shown that the opening of
    these channel allows negatively charged chloride ions, Cl<sup>-</sup>,
    into the cell. This makes the inside of the cell more negative
    than when the channel is not open, making it harder to excite
    that neuron and cause an action potential. GABA binding also
    triggers the opening of potassium, K<sup>+</sup>, channels
    which allow K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell. In this way GABA
    increases the barrier of excitation to the travel of signals
    along nerve fibres and thus makes GABA a component in the
    body’s own systems to reduce the likelihood of a pain signal
    being felt.</p>
