<p>A quick look at the long and varied <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">diagnosis list of facial pain syndromes</a>,
    together with the fact that many of these conditions belong
    to the category of idiopathic (unknown cause) pain, serves
    as a reminder that the treatment of these conditions often
    will be frustrating for patients and clinicians alike: more
    often than not, there will be no straightforward ‘gold standard’
    option to manage such conditions.</p>
<p>The theme reflects the entire range of complex <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">behaviours of pain</a>    in general, a feature that is by no means limited to facial
    pain syndromes. Treatment options will thus include the whole
    breadths of <a href="/treatment/other/medication">different medications</a>    available to suppress or manage different types of pain.
    There are areas of overlap with a number of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">neuropathies (nerve damage)</a>    and many <a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies">treatment options for neuropathic pain</a>    are similar, if not identical, to the options for the
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-pain-syndrome/more-info">treatment of facial pain syndromes</a>.</p>
