<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the pharynx (upper
    part of the throat) include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Difficulty in speaking. Aspects of <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/detailed">surgical reconstruction</a>,
        such as ensuring the postoperative pharynx is not overly
        narrow, can help.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">Difficulty in swallowing</a>        . Much of the supportive treatment lies in the field
        of speech and language therapy, <a href="/help/salt">SALT</a>.</li>
    <li>A sense of sticking in the throat, may or may not have an
        anatomical basis. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antacid">Antacid medication</a>        may help.</li>
</ul>
