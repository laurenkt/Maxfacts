<p>After diagnosis, the treatment options for the majority of benign
    lumps are straightforward.</p>
<p>Sometimes a ‘do nothing, wait and see’ policy is appropriate.
    In many cases, however, surgical removal of a benign lump
    is necessary. The precise strategy and choice of operation
    depends on the location, nature and size of the lesion, as
    well as on the patient (age, fitness, preference – if there
    are different options). Some of these operations may be carried
    out under local anaesthesia, others require <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>,
    mainly depending on the size and location of the benign lump.</p>
<p>The preferred surgical treatment of a benign lump is likely to
    be its complete removal.</p>
