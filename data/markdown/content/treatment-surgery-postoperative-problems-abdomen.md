<p>Postoperative problems affecting the abdomen (belly) can be remedied
    as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars. Gastrostomy (sometimes called a <a href="/help/non-oral-food">PEG, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy</a>)
        scars are from a small puncture wound in the upper left
        abdominal wall. If there is a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistula</a>        (very rare), a formal operation to excise the fistula,
        seal the stomach and improve the skin wound is needed.
        Usually a simple skin scar revision is all that is needed,
        if anything. Abdominal full thickness skin grafts are
        usually harvested from the side of the abdominal wall
        and rarely need revision.</li>
    <li>The rectus abdominis flap for <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">head and neck reconstruction</a>        is done in a variety of shapes but usually lies vertically
        on one side of the abdomen and unless the scar is very
        wide and unsightly rarely needs revision. Rarely, if
        a mesh has been used to reinforce the abdominal wall
        and has been exposed and needed removal, the scar may
        be revised.</li>
</ul>
