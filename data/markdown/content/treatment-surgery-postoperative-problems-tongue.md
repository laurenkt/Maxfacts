<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the tongue include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scarring, leading to limitation of movement. Simple release
        of scars in the same way as a tongue-tie is divided may
        be all that is needed. Complete tethering of the tongue
        may require repair with <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/getting-started">grafts or flaps</a>.</li>
    <li>Disturbed speech. If the problem is caused by tethering of
        the tongue, see above. Otherwise, <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapy (SALT)</a>        may be helpful.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">Disturbed swallowing</a>.
        Swallowing training by <a href="/help/salt">SALT</a>,
        in some cases further <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">surgical correction and repair</a>        may be required.</li>
    <li><a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">Alteration in taste</a>. Surgery
        has little to no role here but self-help with regard
        to <a href="/help/oral-food">appropriate food preparations (taste, texture and temperature)</a>        can be vital.</li>
</ul>
