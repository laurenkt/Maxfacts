<p>Medication plays a major role in the treatment of a very wide
    range of conditions, as the first or only choice, or sometimes
    as an alternative to surgical interventions.</p>
<p>While there may be a very wide range of different conditions
    to be covered in this section, there are many general considerations
    about the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">optimal delivery of medication, appropriate timing and possible interactions with other medicinal drugs</a>    (or food and drink).</p>
<p>A very big topic here is the treatment of different types of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">pain</a>. Other
    generally prominent areas for the application of medication
    are <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">bacterial, viral and fungal infections</a>    and the treatment of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>    caused by malfunction of the immune system. Finally, there
    are further, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">less common conditions</a>    that are best treated by medication, by medication alone
    or in combination with other treatments.</p>
<p>Treating head and neck cancers with <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    does fall under the broad term ‘medication’. However, chemotherapy
    is rather different from other forms of medication and thus
    is discussed separately. The consequences of chemotherapy
    may require treatment with other/additional medication; this
    is discussed in the section dealing with detailed information
    about the <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/application">clinical applications of chemotherapy</a>.</p>
