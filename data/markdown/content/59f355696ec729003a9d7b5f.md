<p>This page gives a general overview of procedures and approaches
    in repairing soft tissue damage in the head and neck area.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about specifics of some of the
        themes around soft tissue damage repair, this information
        is on our <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/detailed">detailed page about soft tissue damage repair</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="initial-steps">Initial steps</h1>
<p>The initial treatment steps include a thorough exploration of
    the wound(s) and other structures, as well as stopping bleeding.</p>
<p>Gaping penetrating wounds of the neck (see Figure 1; deep to
    the platysma, the large but thin muscle covering the front
    middle and sides of the neck) need to be explored in an operating
    theatre environment.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The marginal mandibular branch
        of the facial nerve and the mandible were damaged in
        this meat cleaver injury.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Blood vessels</strong> need to be checked for bleeding
    (often blood vessels that were only partially transected,
    or blood vessels (often completely transected) in a spasm).
    Damaged blood vessels are repaired by ligating them (tied
    up) or by using <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy</a>    (using heat to cause clotting). Vital blood vessels are repaired
    by using fine sutures (stitches) as required.</p>
<p>There is a range of methods <strong>of treating haemorrhage</strong>    (stopping bleeding):</p>
<ul>
    <li>application of direct pressure (all types of bleeds)</li>
    <li>vasoconstrictors (for example <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">adrenaline</a>        which has a temporary and reversible effect)</li>
    <li>haemostatic agents (speeding up the clotting of blood, or
        providing an artificial clot), for example fibrin-based
        products for topical application, or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">tranexamic acid</a>        for systemic application</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy, cautery</a>        or <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous">coblation</a>        (removal of tissue by low-temperature plasma technique)</li>
    <li>ligation (small vessels)</li>
    <li>microsurgical vascular repair (large or major vessels).</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to blood vessels, <strong>nerves</strong> that have been
    partially or completely divided may require microsurgical
    repair, either by directly connecting the proximal and distal
    ends, or by using a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/getting-started">nerve graft</a>.</p>
<p>Other structures and organs in the face that may be involved
    in a wound are the eyes (see Figure 2), ears or salivary
    glands.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Penetrating facial skin injury
        with underlying globe damage.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is obviously important to identify and repair such underlying
    damage, failure to do so could result in long term morbidity
    (ongoing problems). A scalp laceration may overlie a skull
    fracture, a black eye may overlie an orbital / zygomatic
    (cheek bone) fracture, and a facial laceration may overlie
    a parotid (major salivary gland near / in front of ear) duct
    laceration, facial nerve laceration or underlying fracture.</p>
<h1 id="other-investigations">Other investigations</h1>
<p><strong>Foreign bodies:</strong> if the mechanism of injury suggests
    a left behind foreign body (tooth, glass, dirt, projectile),
    then <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiographs</a> taken
    from two directions are used for localisation (see Figure
    3). Some foreign bodies may be more obvious, see Figure 4.
    Some foreign bodies are not straightforward to detect by
    imaging methods: organic structures like wood can be confusing
    and thin hollow plastic objects may resemble air pockets
    on <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Fractured tooth fragment in the
        upper lip localised by radiographs. Such foreign bodies
        must be removed because they will always cause persisting
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">severe infection</a>.
        Foreign bodies, however, can be tricky to find.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> In contrast to the fractured tooth
        fragment (Figure 3), this toothbrush injury was obvious
        to all concerned.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Depending on size, location, nature and toxicity, most foreign
    bodies will require removal. In certain circumstances, it
    may be acceptable to leave inaccessible or innocuous objects;
    shotgun pellets are such an example.</p>
<p><strong>Infection:</strong> swabs for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">culture and sensitivity</a>    will provide baseline information but rarely actually influence
    treatment. Most traumatic soft tissue wounds should have
    the bacterial contamination treated by surface cleansing
    (see below) and a broad-spectrum <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antistaphylococcal antibiotic</a>.</p>
<p>Large complicated or deeply contaminated wounds are best treated
    under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>.
    Most wounds and all complex wounds in children (see Figure
    5) are best treated using general anaesthesia.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Top: multiple lacerations from
        a dog bite in a child should be addressed under general
        anaesthesia in the operating theatre; bottom: after repair.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frankly infected wounds, or wounds with a high likelihood of
    infection are sometimes best left dressed with an antiseptic
    dressing; antibiotics are given and the wounds are closed
    once clean.</p>
<h1 id="wound-cleansing">Wound cleansing</h1>
<p>Cleaning the wounds is the most important stage in <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">reducing the risk of infection</a>    and preventing possible ‘tattooing’ of the tissues by debris
    such as gravel which may have become impacted in or around
    the wound. There are a variety of cleansing solutions available.
    It is not a good idea to compromise adequate cleaning of
    wounds just to avoid <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>.</p>
<p><strong>General method of cleansing</strong> involves:</p>
<ul>
    <li>aseptic scrub</li>
    <li>a suitable antiseptic solution is applied to a sterile gauze
        swab, held in forceps</li>
    <li>the swab is applied to the skin closest to the wound and
        is used to clean the periphery of the wound in an increasing
        radius; the swab is then discarded</li>
    <li>any impacted material can be removed by surgical forceps
        or with a surgical scrubbing brush, dipped in antiseptic
        solution</li>
    <li>the wound is explored again for further foreign material
        and tissue damage</li>
    <li>any small areas of necrotic (dead) tissue or tags of ischaemic
        (lacking blood supply) tissue are trimmed with sharp
        scissors or a scalpel</li>
    <li>the wound can then be irrigated with normal saline and is
        ready for closure.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="wound-closure">Wound closure</h1>
<p>This should always be performed in a good light and preferably
    with assistance (closure of wounds often requires the hands
    of more than one operator). The patient should be positioned
    supine (lying on the back) even when <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/getting-started">local anaesthesia</a>    is used, to minimise the risk of a faint.</p>
<p>There is a considerable <strong>choice of materials</strong>    for wound closure:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>adhesive paper strips</strong> (most useful for small
        wounds in areas where skin tension is not excessive)</li>
    <li><strong>tissue glue</strong> (most useful for superficial,
        uncomplicated skin wounds with little skin tension; popular
        for treating children because no anaesthesia for placement
        and no removal of sutures is needed)</li>
    <li><strong>sutures</strong> (there are many types and strengths
        of suture material, resorbable as well as non-resorbable;
        suture material needs to be chosen to match the defect
        that needs closing)</li>
    <li><strong>staples</strong> (these are rarely if ever used on
        the face).</li>
</ul>
<p>Suture material and its strength have to match the defect that
    needs closing. Tight immobile wounds require thicker sutures;
    delicate, lax areas require fine stitches (see Figure 6 for
    an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Typical monofilament nylon suture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Resorbable sutures</strong> may occasionally be used
    to close skin wounds in children where removal at a later
    date would necessitate another anaesthetic. Resorbable sutures
    are used in deep layer closure (see below) routinely and
    in inaccessible sites. They can play a useful role in subcuticular
    (under the skin) closure techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Staples</strong> can be used as an effective method of
    closure of the skin surface in simple larger wounds. They
    are removed using a staple remover which is often less uncomfortable
    than removing sutures.</p>
<h2>Removal of sutures</h2>
<p>All sutures, being foreign bodies, cause irritation to the tissues
    and hence have the potential to cause scarring. Skin sutures
    are removed as soon as tissue healing allows, preventing
    further irritation of the tissues and avoiding binding of
    the sutures to the tissues as they heal.</p>
<p>As a rough guide non-resorbable sutures are best removed from
    the face at a period of five or six days, when sufficient
    healing has usually taken place to allow function of the
    tissue without re-opening of the wound.</p>
<h1 id="wound-closure-with-sutures-wounds-without-tissue-loss">Wound closure with sutures (wounds without tissue loss)</h1>
<p>Where there has been little or no tissue loss and the margins
    of the wound consist of viable (healthy and stable) tissue,
    primary closure with sutures can usually be achieved.</p>
<p>Commonly used techniques are</p>
<p><strong>Interrupted sutures</strong> are the simplest type of
    suture but also tend to be the most time consuming. Individual
    interrupted sutures can be used to close points of apposition
    in wounds until the entire length of the wound is closed
    (see Figure 7).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Closure of a simple linear incision
        with interrupted sutures.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Interrupted sutures are most useful for closing wounds of irregular
    contour and have the advantage that the closure of the entire
    wound is not dependent on just one suture (see Figure 8).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Top: complex facial laceration
        caused by multiple slashes; bottom: after repair of the
        wounds.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Continuous sutures</strong> are useful for closing straight
    wounds where tissue apposition is easy to achieve with accuracy
    (see Figure 9).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> An example of continuous subcuticular
        (below top layer of skin) suture to close a simple linear
        wound.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is no interruption to the course of the suture, giving
    this suture the advantage of being less time consuming and
    possibly creating a more evenly balanced force of closure
    on the tissues. However, continuous sutures have the disadvantage
    that the whole layer of wound closure is dependent on just
    one suture, and therefore failure may mean re-suturing of
    the entire wound. Continuous sutures also tend only to be
    useful for closure of straight wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Layered closure</strong> is a suitable approach for deep
    wounds, where tissue should be closed in layers to remove
    dead space and confer strength to the wound.</p>
<p>The technique for layered closure involves closing the deeper
    tissues first, usually with a continuous suture or ‘buried’
    (resorbable) interrupted sutures, and then closing the skin
    with interrupted sutures (or occasionally adhesive strips)
    as above.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more detail about various suture techniques,
        or surgical knots, this information is on our <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/detailed">detailed page about soft tissue damage repair</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Deep or extensive wounds may require the insertion of a <strong>drain</strong>,
    which lies along the length of the depth of the wound. The
    purpose of a drain is to remove excessive inflammatory exudate
    and ‘oozed’ blood from the wound to prevent it collecting
    as a focus for infection. A drain placed in a wound is usually
    exited via an area of intact skin and subcutaneous tissue
    and may cause a small scar at that exit point following removal.
    Drains are usually made from plastic tubing which is perforated
    along the section lying within the wound to allow inflow
    of fluid. The outer portion of tubing remains intact and
    can be attached to a container (usually vacuumed) to collect
    and monitor the out-flowing fluid.</p>
<h1 id="wounds-with-tissue-loss">Wounds with tissue loss</h1>
<p>In cases with tissue loss, occasionally the surrounding tissues
    are sufficiently elastic to allow them to be advanced into
    the area of defect and achieve functional and aesthetic closure.
    Where a substantial amount of tissue loss has occurred such
    that closure of the defect without excessive tension on the
    tissues cannot be achieved or would cause disfigurement,
    there are several options available for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Undermining the skin:</strong> when tissue loss is not
    extensive and mainly involves skin, a small border of skin
    either side of the wound may be carefully separated from
    the underlying fat. This allows advancement of the released
    elastic skin across the wound. Specific areas of the face
    are suitable for this technique.</p>
<p><strong>Partial closure / granulation:</strong> this involves
    suturing the wound such that it is partially closed and not
    under excessive tension. The resulting defect is then allowed
    to heal by granulation. This technique is suitable for smaller
    defects but tends to increase the level of scarring; therefore
    it is usually inappropriate for facial wounds.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction"><strong>Skin grafting</strong></a><strong>:</strong>    this is used when mainly large areas of skin have been lost.
    It is often possible to harvest skin from a donor site elsewhere
    in the body for placement over the wounded area. Skin can
    be taken in a partial or full thickness graft from a site
    such as the inner thigh or arm (split thickness) or supraclavicular
    (above the collarbone), pre- or post-auricular (near the
    ears) regions (full thickness). The donated skin may be meshed
    (multiply punctured to allow stretching of the skin over
    a wider area, the epithelium spreading into the small resulting
    defects as healing occurs). Skin colour varies across the
    body and therefore care must be taken to ensure that the
    donor site is a reasonable match to the recipient site (see
    Figure 10).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Split-thickness grafting seldom
        produces a good aesthetic result in the face but does
        allow coverage and initial wound healing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Local flap repair:</strong> it may be possible to utilise
    skin from an area local to the defect by means of raising
    a flap of skin and repositioning it to cover the defect.
    This requires some ‘give’ in the skin at the donor site and
    therefore may require wide undermining of the skin in areas
    where the skin and underlying tissues are under tension or
    tightly bound to underlying structures (for example, the
    scalp). Common designs of flap for repair of defects include
    rotation and advancement flaps.</p>
<aside>
    <p>The <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">principles of local flap repairs</a>        as well as <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed">some real-life examples</a>        for the use of local flaps in repairing facial skin defects
        can be found in our section about facial treatment of
        facial skin cancer.</p>
</aside>
<p>Local tissue can be augmented by local tissue expansion (see
    Figure 11). This takes time but creates a large amount of
    surplus local tissue for wound repair which gives close to
    the ideal colour and texture match.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure11.jpg">

        patient in Figure 10 to use healthy local tissue for
        closure; right: after excision of skin graft and movement
        of local flaps.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Distant flap repair:</strong> this involves removing
    donor tissue, including vasculature (blood vessels) from
    a distant body site and anastomosing (connecting) the vessels
    to the vasculature of the recipient site prior to repair.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Detailed information about distant soft tissue flaps (free
        flaps) and other related surgical techniques is in our
        section about <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>        .</p>
</aside>
<p>There is a small risk that the circulation in the ‘free flap’
    will fail (usually due to thrombosis in the venous system)
    and this is generally a more time consuming and complex operation.
    This repair method should be reserved for areas where there
    is extensive tissue loss and local flap repair would not
    suffice.</p>
<h1 id="after-damage-repair-wound-healing-scarring-and-potential-problems">After damage repair: wound healing, scarring and potential problems</h1>
<p>Following tissue trauma, there is an initial acute inflammatory
    response until fibrous tissue in the wound eventually matures
    to form a ‘scar’.  A number of factors affect the <strong>wound healing process</strong>,
    including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>site of the wound (tissue, blood perfusion, movement, and
        so on)</li>
    <li>timing of treatment</li>
    <li>nature of treatment (correct or incorrect technique)</li>
    <li>systemic factors (age, health, nutrition, use of steroids,
        and so on)</li>
    <li>infection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost every injury involving a breach of the skin will result
    in a <strong>degree of scarring</strong>. In many circumstances,
    scars are in areas where they will not readily be noticed
    by other people and therefore they are of little or no consequence.
    Indeed, even in clearly visible areas, scars are often so
    fine as to be barely noticeable, or may be disguised within
    the natural skin creases or relaxed skin tension lines. Elective
    incisions for surgery are designed such that they respect
    the relaxed skin tension lines and so produce as minimal
    scarring as possible. However, trauma has no respect of aesthetics
    and therefore the scar produced by a trauma wound may prove
    to be particularly unsightly. Linear wounds tend to develop
    more obvious scarring than do irregular wounds unless a linear
    repair eyebrow has been mismatched (see Figure 12. Good wound
    care, early suture removal, moisturisation and <a href="/help/physiotherapy">massage</a>    all help to reduce scarring.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level2-figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> Left: a typical hypertrophic
        (deposit of excessive amount of connective tissue (collagen))
        scar; right: a mismatch of natural facial features (in
        this case the eyebrow) produces a poor aesthetic appearance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Non-surgical techniques to improve scars include silicone based
    gels for self-application, silicon pressure dressings, application
    of intra-lesional <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">steroids</a>    or steroid impregnated tape.</p>
<p>If a scar is particularly aesthetically disturbing, it may be
    possible to perform ‘scar revision’, that is to surgically
    modify the scar such that it is reduced or is aesthetically
    disguised. There are a variety of techniques for such purposes
    and it is essential that the timing for such corrective interventions
    is well chosen: it usually takes about 18 months for a scar
    to be fully matured. Ideally scar revision should not be
    undertaken any earlier than that.</p>
<p>The most common problems following soft tissue damage repair
    are various forms of <strong>wound infection</strong>. Common
    reasons for infection(s) include:</p>
<p>Pre-operatively:</p>
<ul>
    <li>wound contamination with microorganisms at the time of trauma</li>
    <li>delay in treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>Post-operatively:</p>
<ul>
    <li>contamination at the time of injury</li>
    <li>poor cleansing / wound debridement or poor aseptic operative
        technique</li>
    <li>poor closure of the wound</li>
    <li>failure to administer appropriate ‘prophylactic’ antibiotics</li>
    <li>host susceptibility.</li>
