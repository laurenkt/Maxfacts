<p>Below a brief description of the normal development of the vascular
    system is given; followed by a short discussion of the current
    thinking about the developmental failures that lead to vascular
    abnormalities. It may come as a surprise that relatively
    little is understood about the causes of the most common,
    sporadic abnormalities.</p>
<h1 id="development-of-vasculature">Development of vasculature</h1>
<p>An endothelium-lined complex vascular system is a relatively
    recent evolutionary trait and only mammals have such a circulatory
    system. From the point of view of tissue maintenance, delivery
    of nutrients to tissues as well as removal of debris from
    tissues, it is a very attractive transport system. It permits
    high flow rates (laminar flow) and can reach all tissues
    at all times, flexibly and demand-driven.</p>
<p>The endothelium itself is increasingly recognised as an organ
    in its own right, rather than just providing the lining of
    vessels. The metabolism of endothelial cells is increasingly
    well understood, as is their role in a large number of conditions
    and diseases, as well as in health. Given that the vascular
    system is engaged with every part of the body, it is probably
    not surprising that malfunctions of the endothelium lead
    to vascular malfunctions, over- as well as under-activity,
    and are involved with conditions including cardiac and pulmonary
    pathologies, inflammatory disorders, eye diseases, diabetes
    and atherosclerosis, and many more.</p>
<p>In the development of an embryo, the vascular system is one of
    the first units to form. It is an orchestrated process that
    follows several developmental steps (Figure 1).</p>

        vascular system.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The initial step in the development is the differentiation of
    precursor cells (angioblasts). Angioblasts are undifferentiated
    cells which initially develop into endothelial cells. The
    endothelial cells form an initial, primitive basic vascular
    network (vasculogenesis). In the following steps, this initial
    network grows and develops into a fully differentiated vascular
    system (angiogenesis). This happens by two mechanisms, splitting
    of an initial vessel (intussusception), and/or angiogenesis
    where new vessels sprout. The development of the vascular
    system also entails the simultaneous growth of smooth muscle
    tissue that envelops the endothelium to form a fully functional
    vessel.</p>
<p>Once fully developed, the exact functions and metabolism of endothelium
    and angiogenesis are different in different tissues. Vascular
    renewal and growth is different in the embryo (where it starts
    from scratch) to the mechanisms in an adult (where it happens
    on the back of an existing vascular system). In an adult,
    the main mechanism for the growth of new vessels is by angiogenesis.
    This is true for physiological (for example, after injury)
    and for pathological processes (for example, angiogenesis
    driven by a malignancy).</p>
<h1 id="pathogenesis-of-haemangioma">Pathogenesis of haemangioma</h1>
<p>It has been said that haemangioma is the most common benign childhood
    tumour and the least understood. However, more experimental
    evidence is emerging and some, in part contradictory, hypotheses
    have been formulated. It may turn out later that these hypotheses
    are simply different aspects of the overall picture. No specific
    inherited genetic mutations have been identified in conjunction
    with the most common forms of haemangioma.</p>
<p>It is undisputed that the proliferation phase of haemangioma
    is characterised by the presence of hyperplastic (large numbers)
    endothelial cells, giving rise to growth and incomplete and
    defunct blood vessel architecture. Some researchers think
    that this is caused by an intrinsic defect of the endothelial
    cells (which in haemangioma have been found to derive from
    a single precursor cell and to be clones of each other).
    Others think that extrinsic local environment / tissue effects
    are at the core of the malformation, and that the proliferation
    of endothelial cells is a response to such external factors.
    The main such factor cited is hypoxia (insufficient oxygen
    supply) as a trigger. The finding of clonal cells, however,
    would rule out extrinsic factors as the sole cause.</p>
<p>Another experimental finding may provide the link between the
    two hypotheses by identifying a unique pattern of biochemical
    marker molecules, expressed by placenta tissue and haemangioma,
    in particular a glucose transporter protein called GLUT1.
    This protein is expressed in most foetal endothelial cells,
    but in later development is lost in nearly all tissues, except
    some microvessels in the placenta and the brain. In fact,
    looking for GLUT1 in haemangioma tissue has become the standard
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">pathology test</a>    to differentiate between haemangioma and other vascular malformations.</p>
<p>If the precursor cells are derived from placental tissue, then
    replicate by cloning, it will take specific local environmental
    factors (such as acidity, hypoxia, messenger molecules (cytokines),
    presence or absence and/or imbalance of growth factors and
    their inhibitors, possibly including some genetic pre-disposition,
    and so on) for haemangioma tissue with placental biomarker
    characteristics to develop in skin (for example). This concept
    combines most of the current evidence into a feasible combined
    scenario but requires much more work to be verified (or replaced
    by some alternative theories).</p>
<p>Many of the growth factors known to be involved in vasculogenesis
    and angiogenesis are found at increased levels in the proliferation
    phase of haemangioma, in particular the vascular endothelial
    growth factor (VEGF). These concentrations decrease with
    involution of the lesion, when instead levels of biomarkers
    for programmed cell death, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">apoptosis</a>    increase. The serendipitous discovery of <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">propranolol as a medicinal agent to treat haemangioma</a>    fits in with this observation: propranolol is thought to
    enhance endothelial apoptosis events and may thus simply
    provide a shortcut to the involution phase of haemangioma.
    However, it is currently not known what exactly triggers
    and drives the transition from proliferation to involution
    of haemangioma. There are more questions that need answers:
    i) why are females significantly more often afflicted than
    males, approximately in a ratio 2 : 1; ii) why is the head
    and neck region the most common location of infantile haemangioma.</p>
<h1 id="pathogenesis-of-vascular-malformations">Pathogenesis of vascular malformations</h1>
<p>Hyperplastic endothelial cells, characteristic in haemangioma,
    are absent in vascular malformations. Instead, these lesions
    are composed of dysfunctional architecture of vessels, which
    progressively enlarge (hypertrophy). The dysfunctional architecture
    includes abnormally developed vascular smooth muscle cells
    (glomous cells), irregularly enveloping the endothelium,
    leading to dilated, thin-walled dysfunctional vessels.</p>
<p>The formation of vascular malformations is associated with the
    vasculogenesis phase of early foetal development, at approximately
    weeks 6 to 10 of pregnancy. Vascular malformations are rare
    conditions, with the possible exception of sporadic (minor)
    venous malformations. Vascular malformations are sometimes
    associated with other congenital syndromes and then usually
    have a clear genetic fingerprint and inheritance track.</p>
<p>Still, the overwhelming majority of vascular malformations are
    sporadic, including lymphatic malformations, which have always
    been found to be sporadic. The pathogenesis of sporadic vascular
    malformations (irrespective of vessel type) remains a matter
    of speculation, but there is an increasing body of experimental
    evidence and data which eventually may develop into a well-formed
    idea about the pathogenesis of vascular malformations.</p>
<p>Of the currently patchy picture of information, some is experimental
    and some is anecdotal. For example, vascular malformations
    affect males and females equally and respond to hormonal
    changes (puberty and pregnancy) with sometimes aggressive
    growth; similar behaviour has been described after mechanical
    trauma. Such properties may hold clues about the underlying
    mechanisms of these sporadic lesions.</p>
<p>Biochemical research is pointing to faults in vasculogenesis
    as an important factor. A significant percentage of cases
    of all venous malformations show mutations in the TEK gene
    on chromosome 9p. This mutation is responsible for disabling
    a particular receptor, TIE2. The TIE2 receptor plays a crucial
    role in vasculogenesis. These observations also tentatively
    explain some promising initial results of <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">treating lymphatic malformations with an mTOR inhibitor</a>    (sirolimus): the TIE2 receptor is closely linked with the
    mTOR signalling pathway in cellular metabolism. A number
    of further ‘hot spot’ mutations have been identified and
    will add to the understanding of the pathological developments.</p>
<p>Further vascular growth factors have been found to be upregulated,
    which has given rise to the hypothesis that some or all vascular
    malformations may also have some proliferation (hyperplasia)
    properties (in addition to the commonly accepted hypertrophy
    behaviour). This idea is further supported by recent observations
    of a particular enzyme (metalloproteinase-9) in some vascular
    malformations. Venous malformations display increased levels
    of neural components (whereas lymphatic malformations lack
    these completely) and show the presence of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/steroids">progesterone</a>    receptors. The latter finding may be related to the common
    enhanced growth rates of vascular malformations at times
    of hormonal changes.</p>
<p>For some of the rare hereditary vascular malformations, causal
    changes to chromosomes and genes have been identified. The
    sometimes well known effects of these mutations may in the
    future contribute to plausible explanations of the underlying
    causes and mechanisms of sporadic vascular malformations.
    For the time being, however, very little is known about the
    pathogenesis of these sporadic lesions.</p>
