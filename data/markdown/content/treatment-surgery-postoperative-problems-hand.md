<p>Treatment of postoperative problems affecting the hand include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No direct surgery on the hand is part of usual maxillofacial
        practice but affects on the hand second to surgery on
        the forearm can have <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/lower-arm">indirect effects</a>.</li>
    <li>The treatment is therefore the same as for <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/lower-arm">postoperative problems of the forearm</a>.</li>
</ul>
