<p>Below aspects of soft and hard tissue surgery in preparation
    for prosthesis, including osseointegrated implants, are described.</p>
<h1 id="soft-tissue-surgery">Soft tissue surgery</h1>
<p>Below some common soft tissue procedures include are outlined:</p>
<ul>
    <li>frenectomy;</li>
    <li>ridge reduction;</li>
    <li>removal of irritation (‘denture’) hyperplasia;</li>
    <li>vestibuloplasty.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frenectomy</h2>
<p>Large frenae (Figure 1) or resorption of the residual ridge can
    interfere with the peripheral seal of a denture leading to
    poor retention. The relief for such frenae (that is drilling
    away some of the acrylic of the denture to accommodate the
    frenum) may also result in repeat fractures of the prosthesis
    and discomfort. In these cases, frenectomy is performed either
    by simple division or by <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">Z-plasty</a>.</p>

        into a loose diamond shape.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>‘Flabby’ ridge reduction (‘Schlotterkamm’)</strong></p>
<p>Where tooth loss has been associated with <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">advanced periodontal disease</a>,
    excess of soft tissue may result in a flabby ridge which
    in turn causes poor denture stability. This commonly affects
    the maxillary tuberosity region and labial segments. The
    localised bone loss can be further accelerated if natural
    standing teeth oppose a denture. In these cases, soft tissue
    reduction is carried out by excision of the underlying fibrous
    tissue whilst preserving, where possible, the attached mucosa.
    In these cases, it is important to have a replacement baseplate
    in which a tissue conditioner can be placed to enable close
    adaptation of the mucosa to the underlying bony ridge.</p>
<p><strong>Irritation (denture) hyperplasia</strong>.</p>
<p>Resorption of the residual ridge continues after initial socket
    healing. The loss of bone height will result in a previously
    adequately extended denture having a peripheral margin that
    is overextended, usually into the buccal or labial sulcus.
    This causes a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">traumatic ulcer in the sulcus</a>    , which, with repeated trauma, produces an overgrowth of
    fibrous (scar) tissue. Initial management is by the drastic
    local relief of the flange of the denture and strict instructions
    to leave the denture out as much as possible (‘social use
    only’). After a period of a few weeks, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>    is reduced and the hyperplastic tissue reduces in size. In
    many cases the reduction in size is such that the hyperplastic
    tissue will not interfere with new denture construction.</p>
<p>Where the residual hyperplastic tissue will interfere with denture
    construction, excision is indicated (Figure 2). This may
    take the form of a simple excision, with elliptical excision
    of the excess tissue at its base. In large areas of hyperplasia,
    simple excision may create a shallow V-shaped sulcus. In
    these cases, a mucosal-preserving approach should be attempted,
    by dissecting and preserving the buccal / labial mucosa while
    excising the remainder of the hyperplastic lesion. The preserved
    mucosa is inlaid as a graft to preserve sulcus depth. In
    this case, a healing baseplate suitably lined with tissue
    conditioner is essential to try to maintain sulcus depth.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure2.jpg">

        excision of irritation hyperplasia; bottom: mucosa should
        be preserved wherever possible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Vestibuloplasty</h2>
<p>In areas where there has been loss of residual ridge height or
    sulcus depth, commonly due to the loss of attached mucosa,
    vestibuloplasty may be beneficial. In these cases, a supraperiosteal
    mucosal flap is reflected and sutured ‘apically’ in the sulcus.
    Muscle attachments may need to be released in order to achieve
    the desired increase in sulcus depth. The exposed periosteum
    may be left to granulate, however this may result in scarring
    and a narrow V-shaped sulcus, which the prosthetist may have
    difficulty in utilising. Scar reduction may be achieved by
    grafting with palatal mucosal free graft or <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">split skin graft</a>.
    In either case, a healing baseplate lined with gutta percha
    or a proprietary denture liner should be fixed in place for
    the initial healing period by means of a heavy non-resorbable
    suture (or stainless steel wire) passed around the mandible
    or less often through the maxillary antrum or screws directly
    into the hard palate.</p>
<p>After initial healing, a temporary denture extended to the full
    depth of the new sulcus should be provided. Unfortunately,
    the benefits of vestibuloplasty are lost if subsequent prostheses
    do not make full use of the new sulcus depth.</p>
<h1 id="hard-tissue-surgery">Hard tissue surgery</h1>
<p>Hard tissue surgery may be required in the form of</p>
<ul>
    <li>alveoplasty;</li>
    <li>ridge reduction;</li>
    <li>removal of tori and reduction in muscle attachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>These procedures aim to reduce or remove hard tissue prominences
    that create excess undercuts, which the prosthetist is unable
    to use, so creating dead spaces. Complete elimination of
    undercuts might lead to a worse condition post-operatively
    with a completely unretentive denture. It is even more important
    in hard tissue preprosthetic surgery that liaison is maintained
    between the surgeon and the prosthetist to agree on how much
    bone should be removed in order to achieve the maximum prosthetic
    gain.</p>
<p>Where there has been significant bone loss, consideration may
    be given to</p>
<ul>
    <li>ridge augmentation (onlay or interpositional grafting);</li>
    <li>distraction osteogenesis.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these techniques may be augmented by the use of growth
    factors derived from <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/platelet-plasma">platelet-rich plasma</a>.</p>
<h2>Alveoplasty</h2>
<p>Despite the most careful of extraction techniques circumstances
    will occur where the residual ridge heals to become irregular
    or feather edged. Pressure on these bony irregularities under
    the mucosa by a denture results in pain. Alveoplasty is the
    smoothing of these bony irregularities. Mucoperiosteal flaps
    are reflected using a sub-crestal incision to expose the
    whole of the residual ridge. The irregular areas can be visualised
    or felt with the gloved finger and smoothed using hand instruments
    or well-irrigated burrs. Alveolar bone is precious and only
    the minimum amount of bone should be removed in order to
    achieve the desired result. In cases where extensive smoothing
    is required, an intraoperative clear acrylic template may
    help demonstrate residual areas of irregularity by blanching
    of the underlying mucosa.</p>
<h2>Ridge reduction</h2>
<p>Where the residual ridge heals with excessive undercuts, reduction
    may be of benefit. In consultation with the prosthetist,
    the undercut is reduced or removed via a mucoperiosteal flap
    raised from a sub-crestal incision. Pre-surgical planning
    demonstrating acceptable paths of insertion will dictate
    how much undercut should be removed to give the maximum denture
    retention (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Top: intraoperative view of ridge
        reduction technique; bottom: surgical baseplate in place.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Removal of tori and muscle attachments</h2>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">Palatal and lingual (mandibular) tori</a>    are normal anatomical variants. The lingual tori and prominent
    genial tubercles are often bony overgrowths at the site of
    muscle attachments. As the lower full denture is inherently
    unstable, there may be benefits in retaining the lingual
    torus unilaterally to facilitate the use of the undercut
    to improve retention and stability. Prominent genial tubercles
    commonly occur in the atrophic mandible. They are removed
    on symptomatic grounds but may result in further loss of
    stability of the lower prosthesis.</p>
<p>Lingual tori are removed via a lingual mucoperiosteal flap. Care
    should be taken in reflection of these flaps, as the mucosa
    is friable. Particular care needs to be taken around the
    bony prominence due to undercuts. The bony prominence may
    be removed with burs combined with hand instruments such
    as an osteotome. A wide flap is raised to protect the lingual
    nerve adequately because, idiosyncratically, a wide subperiosteal
    lingual flap is associated with a lower level of lingual
    nerve neuropraxia than a small flap<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Palatal tori should be removed if they cause denture instability
    or repeated fracture or where there is soft tissue trauma.
    The torus is removed via a split palatal mucoperiosteal flap,
    preserving the incisive neurovascular bundle, in order to
    fully expose the bony torus. Reflection of the flap over
    the torus is often difficult due to undercuts. The torus
    is sectioned with a fissure burr and each segment removed
    with an osteotome or chisel. Final smoothing is with a large
    bone-cutting burr. Following closure, a healing baseplate
    or pack may be placed to reduce the risk of a haematoma forming
    from the raw bone margins (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure4.jpg">

        subperiosteal flap raised; top right: sectioning and
        removing the bone; bottom left: bleeding from the base
        of the bone; bottom right: wound closure with resorbable
        sutures.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Ridge augmentation</h2>
<p>The residual ridge may be built up using a variety of materials.
    These include bone autografts or allografts (or bone substitutes).
    The risks of viral and prion infections make the use of xenografts
    or cadaveric materials no longer acceptable. These grafts
    may be placed as either onlay or interpositional grafts.</p>
<p>The main complication of ridge augmentation is accelerated resorption
    of the graft. This is thought to be due to lack of an adequate
    soft tissue envelope resulting in little space for graft
    placement. The resulting tight tissue envelope is thought
    to produce loss of the graft. Techniques to improve the soft
    tissue space, such as periosteal release, can lead to loss
    of sulcus depth and attached mucosa. This means a later vestibuloplasty
    (see above) and graft in order to allow full use of the ridge
    height gained. A brief experiment with intraoral tissue expansion
    was never followed through, although it provided a theoretical
    technique to overcome this problem.</p>
<h2><strong>Complications of ridge augmentation</strong>, in addition
    to general post-operative complications of <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">bleeding</a>,
    bruising, swelling, and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>,
    may include:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>accelerated bone loss as discussed above;</li>
    <li>nerve injuries - surgical approaches close to the infraorbital
        and mental nerves may give transient or long standing
        altered sensation. Harvest of a bone graft from the chin
        may damage the branches of the incisive nerve to give
        paraesthesia of the gingivae of the lower labial segment.
        Harvest of bone from the retro-molar region may involve
        the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle, with resultant
        mental paraesthesia;</li>
    <li>fracture - in a severely atrophic mandible, osteotomies for
        distraction osteogenesis may predispose to a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">pathological fracture</a>;</li>
    <li>loss of soft tissue support - extensive stripping of the
        tissues around the chin can lead to loss of the muscle
        attachments, resulting in the chin no longer being supported
        and being displaced inferiorly giving an unacceptable
        profile (‘witch’s chin’).</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing the <strong>donor site for autografts</strong>,
    consideration should be given to the volume of bone required,
    the need for particulate or cortico-cancellous block and
    ease of harvest. There is evidence to suggest that donor
    bone of the same embryological type gives better results
    with less resorption. The bone of the residual alveolar ridge
    is membranous in origin. This supports the use of the retromolar
    regions or chin as intra-oral sites, which are readily available
    under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local anaesthesia</a>    and are membranous in origin. Where large shaped cortico-cancellous
    blocks are required, anterior or posterior iliac crest proves
    the most suitable site, even though this is of endochondral
    origin.</p>
<p><strong>Allographic materials</strong> are inorganic bone substitutes.
    These may be calcium phosphates or hydroxyapatites. There
    is significant experience using bovine bone, which has been
    treated to remove all organic material. These materials can
    be used alone or as a bulking agent for bone autografts<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>These graft materials may be augmented by the use of <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/platelet-plasma">platelet-rich plasma</a>.
    The principles behind the use of platelet-rich plasma is
    the concentration of growth factors (endothelial derived
    growth factor (EDGF), vascular derived growth factor (VDGF),
    transforming growth factor-<i>β</i>2 group, including bone
    morphogenic protein (BMP)) in platelets. A sample of the
    patient’s blood is manipulated in a centrifuge to give 5
    to 9 ml of plasma, which contains 2 million platelets. The
    effect of platelet-rich plasma is to give earlier vascularisation
    of the bone graft, which allows earlier and better bone consolidation.
    There are also soft tissue effects with improved healing
    (Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Platelet-rich plasma (right) and
        hydroxyapatite (left).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An alternative is to use commercially prepared bone morphogenic
    protein, although this is expensive and excites a significant
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammatory response</a>.</p>
<p>In Germany the most commonly used bone substitute is derived
    from bovine material which makes it a xenograft. There is
    a big lobby by the pharmaceutical companies for allo- and
    xenografts in Germany. Patients are receptive of the idea
    of using bone substitute material as it prevents donor site
    morbidity.</p>
<h2>Distraction osteogenesis</h2>
<p>The advent of distraction osteogenesis applied to the facial
    bones using the principles originally developed by Ilizarov
    is an alternative method of ridge augmentation which may
    overcome some of the problems associated with onlay or interpositional
    ridge augmentation. The surgical technique involves an osteotomy
    of the residual ridge to create a mobile segment. A distraction
    appliance is fitted and the wound closed. After a latency
    period the device is activated to increase the alveolar bone
    height along a predetermined vector. Once the planned amount
    of bone height increase has been reached, the device is left
    for a period of up to two months before it is removed. The
    advantages of this approach are the removal of the need for
    a second donor site and risks associated with the use of
    allografts. In addition to distraction osteogenesis, there
    is also distraction histogenesis increasing the soft tissue
    envelope, so reducing the risk of increased resorption. The
    technique does require two surgical procedures and the use
    of specialist devices with associated costs. Careful patient
    selection is necessary as sufficient bone must be present
    to allow the initial osteotomy. The rate of distraction is
    critical. If the distraction rate is too fast, wasting of
    the bone occurs. If the distraction rate is too slow, the
    transport disc fuses prematurely. This can be overcome by
    placing a platelet-rich plasma / bone graft interposed at
    the osteotomy site.</p>
<h2>Orthognathic surgery in preprosthetic surgery</h2>
<p>In cases where there is an existing skeletal anomaly, this can
    be further exaggerated by bone resorption. In particular
    resorption of the maxilla is both vertical and horizontal.
    Ridge augmentation (see above) alone may not be sufficient
    to allow for the satisfactory construction of conventional
    dentures. In these situations, consideration may be given
    to a combined augmentation and maxillary repositioning procedure.
    This will involve a <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">Le Fort I advancement osteotomy</a>    with the insertion of an interpositional horseshoe cortico-cancellous
    bone graft to down-graft the residual ridge and give ridge
    augmentation. The planning of this procedure is similar to
    that for orthognathic surgery in dentate individuals, modified
    to take account of the proposed positioning of the incisal
    tips of the prosthesis.</p>
<p>Mandibular prognathism may be corrected by conventional <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">setback osteotomies</a>.
    There is a change in blood supply to the mandibular bone
    following the loss of teeth, and the potential effects this
    may have on healing. The advent of distraction osteogenesis
    has probably cast procedures such as the visor osteotomy
    to the history books.</p>
<h1 id="surgery-for-osseointegrated-implants">Surgery for osseointegrated implants</h1>
<p>Bone grafting is often required to provide sufficient height
    and / or width of the alveolus to allow implant placement.
    The commonest grafting procedures are <strong>sinus lifting</strong>    and <strong>onlay grafting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Sinus lifting</strong> is necessary where the floor of
    the maxillary antrum invaginates the residual alveolar ridge
    in the premolar region, reducing the amount of bone height
    required for placement of implants in this area. The surgical
    technique is similar to a <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">Caldwell-Luc approach to the maxillary antrum</a>.
    In the case of sinus lifting, the bone window is retained
    attached to the antral lining, which is carefully elevated
    from the antral floor to create a mucoperiosteal pocket (Figure
    6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Sinus lift; top left: incision
        and exposure of the sinus lift; top right: the antral
        lining is elevated; bottom: a bone graft is placed and
        secured between bone of the antral floor and the elevated
        lining.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bone is placed into this pocket so raising the antral floor.
    Indirect closed sinus lifting can also be carried out at
    the time of implant placement if the amount of additional
    bone required is small. In this case the bone is prepared
    for the implant in the normal manner, taking care not to
    perforate the antral lining. The antral lining is lifted
    through the hole and bone graft packed into the prepared
    hole immediately before fixture placement. In the process
    of placing the fixture, the bone graft is forced under the
    antral lining giving the necessary support for the newly
    placed fixture.</p>
<p><strong>Onlay grafting</strong> is required to increase residual
    alveolar ridge width and height. The anterior alveolus in
    particular resorbs both vertically and distally, giving a
    narrow palatal or lingually placed residual ridge. Onlay
    grafting allows for the restoration of normal ridge width
    and eliminates concavities, which may result in exposed implant
    threads.</p>
<p>Other techniques to increase residual bone height and width include
    cortico-cancellous block grafts and segmental distraction
    osteogenesis. Segmental distraction osteogenesis can be performed
    either before implant placement or, with special distraction
    implants, following fixture placement.</p>
<h2><strong>Individual implant placement</strong></h2>
<p>This is usually performed under local anaesthesia [treatment-surgery-anaesthesia-preamble]
    with or without sedation. The residual alveolar ridge is
    exposed by a crestal incision and mucoperiosteal flaps are
    raised medially and laterally. The bone is prepared by drilling
    at slow speed with meticulous irrigation to avoid osteocyte
    death caused by bone overheating. The implant site is prepared
    by sequentially increasing twist drill size to reach one
    just under the maximum diameter of the implant. Depending
    on bone density and implant design, the bone is tapped (prepared
    for a thread) before placing the implant. This is also done
    under coolant irrigation (Figure 7).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Implant socket preparation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is essential to avoid contamination of the pure titanium surface
    of the implant with stainless steel instruments or soft tissue<strong>.</strong>    The implant is screwed into the bone at slow speed until
    the maximum torque is reached. Over-tightening can strip
    the implant from the bone. Sometimes exposed threads are
    seen on the buccal/labial aspect of the implant on final
    placement. If there is primary stability, the majority of
    implants will integrate despite exposed threads (Figure 8).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Implant socket preparation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These threads can also be covered by bone harvested by a surgical
    filter or bone substitute. Semipermeable membrane covering
    this can promote healing by guided tissue regeneration (Figure
    9). A cover screw is fitted over the internal threads of
    the implant (Figure 10) and the wound closed. The patient
    is advised not to wear their prosthesis for 7 to 10 days,
    followed by occasional wear only.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-preprosthetic-surgery-level3-figure9.jpg">

        regeneration.</figcaption>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Dental implants in place with
        cover screws visible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The time taken for integration depends on the quality of bone
    available at the implant site. It is generally accepted that
    an implant will integrate in 3 months in the mandible and
    in 3 to 6 months in the maxilla. Titanium oxide coatings
    on the threads of implants have reduced the integration time
    in the maxilla.</p>
<p>At second stage surgery, a small mucosal window is cut over the
    cover screw and the cover screw removed. Any covering bone
    is removed. A temporary ‘healing’ abutment is placed of a
    size which will allow suitable protrusion through the mucoperiosteum.
    This is left in place for a minimum of two weeks to allow
    the mucosal cuff to heal around the healing abutment. Once
    healing has occurred, the final abutment is placed and impressions
    taken of the fixture head for <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants/detailed">construction of the definitive prosthesis</a>.
    The technique for implant placement is essentially the same
    for single and multiple implant restorations.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-pretreatment"><strong>Surgery for prosthodontics in patients with head &amp; neck cancer</strong></a></p>
<p>Surgery for prosthodontics in patients with head and neck cancer
    should be considered at the time of planning for the ablative
    surgery. The eventual rehabilitation of the patient has to
    be considered at the time of initial resection and reconstruction
    but must not compromise the principles of oncological surgery.
    With this in mind, planning of flaps to restore tissue volume
    should bear in mind the eventual prosthetic rehabilitation
    with regard to appropriate bulk and preservation, where possible,
    of appropriate bone and soft tissue undercuts.</p>

<h2>Complications of osseo-integrated implants</h2>
<p>Apart from the traditional peri-operative complications associated
    with any minor oral surgical procedure (such as bruising,
    swelling, risk of infection and bleeding), there are few
    special complications associated with osseointegrated implants.
    In the placement of implants in the anterior mandible, in
    particular where using ‘same day teeth’ techniques, the preparation
    of the bone for the implant often involves perforation of
    the cortical bone of the lower border of the mandible. This
    comes with the risk of localised cutaneous bruising. Similarly,
    in placement of the implants in the anterior maxilla, the
    cortical bone of the nasal floor is often utilised, with
    the possibility of bruising around the nose and nasal stuffiness.</p>
<p>In all cases there is the possibility of the implant failing
    to integrate. This is usually detected at the time of second
    stage surgery, and where attempts to remove the cover screw
    lead to unscrewing of the implant. In this situation the
    bone is allowed to heal and the implant can usually be replaced
    after allowing three months for bone to regenerate.</p>
<p>It is normally expected that there is a small amount of bone
    loss around implants in the order of less than 0.1 mm per
    year. Where there is excessive loading of the implant-retained
    prosthesis or exceptionally poor <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>,
    inflammation of the mucosal cuff around the implant abutment
    may be seen with localised bone loss at the pocket formation.
    This peri-implantitis is usually reversible with judicious
    oral hygiene measures and professional scaling, although
