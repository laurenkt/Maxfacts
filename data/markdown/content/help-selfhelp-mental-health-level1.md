<p>The relationship between physical and mental health
    adversely affects individuals’ quality of life as well
    as society as a whole. The World Health Organization
    (WHO) states that ‘health is a state of complete
    physical, mental and social well-being and not merely
    the absence of disease or infirmity’ and further
    emphasizes that ‘there is no health without mental
    health’. The well recognised inextricable links between
    physical and mental health explain the increased risk of
    developing poor mental health on top of suffering from a
    physical disorder, or mental disorders leading to poor
    physical health. The scheme in Figure 1 illustrates as
    an example how at every stage of a physical illness,
    mental health may be affected.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A brief summary
        of the overlap between physical and mental health
        before, during and after treatment of a physical
        disorder.</figcaption>

<p>The overview in Figure 1 includes a number of aspects
    that contribute to the interplay of mental and physical
    health:</p>
<ul>
    <li>considerations of mental health apply to everyone
        involved, including patients, carers, family and
        friends, clinicians;</li>
    <li>a number of external factors (for example, quality
        of communication, quality of social support, quality
        of insight by all stakeholders, degree of realism
        about expectations) play a role in determining the
        individual balance between physical and mental
        health;</li>
    <li>the severity of mental health problems can be widely
        variable and there may be repeated episodes of poor
        mental health;</li>
    <li>there are no general or straightforward ‘solutions’
        to improve mental health, protecting and/or
        regaining good mental health is a highly individual
        challenge;</li>
    <li>oral and maxillofacial conditions and their
        treatments share a number of common mental-health
        associations with other physical conditions, but
        oral and maxillofacial conditions do have a
        particular profile of overlaps between physical and
        mental health.</li>
</ul>
<p>We describe on the following pages in greater detail the
    diverse <a href="/help/mental-health/more-info">overlaps
        between oral and maxillofacial conditions and mental
        health</a> as well as <a href="/help/mental-health/detailed">interventions
        and management of mental-health problems</a>
    associated with oral and maxillofacial conditions.</p>
