<p>You may experience a wide range of difficulties and problems
    during treatment or afterwards as a long-term or permanent
    consequence of treatment. Well established ways to deal with
    such issues exist, in some areas new and fresh thinking is
    emerging - in all cases it is crucially important to put
    you (back) in control of your life. There are so many different
    ways in which you can massively improve outcomes and the
    quality of your life by actively working toward such goals.
    The best way forward is to be knowledgeable and realistic
    about various options, and to be prepared for positive surprises
    about how much a range of everyday exercises, tricks, change
    of routines, and so on can actually achieve!</p>
<p><a href="/help/physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</a> plays an important
    role to get you ‘out and about’ in the short term as well
    as to optimise long-term outcomes; some patience and perseverance
    may be required.</p>
<p>The best possible <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    routines, both on a daily basis at home and with professional
    support, will pay ample dividend. You can enormously improve
    your oral health as well as your overall well-being. Unsurprisingly
    many aspects of <a href="/help/oral-food">eating and drinking</a>    feature prominently with many maxillofacial patients, from
    minor problems to severe disruptions, including temporary
    or permanent need for <a href="/help/non-oral-food">non-oral feeding</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/help/salt">Speech and language therapy</a> will place
    a focus on speech and language skills, but will also pay
    attention to your ability and techniques to swallow safely.</p>
<p>Return to work after treatment may benefit from some adjustments
    to your work routines, <a href="/help/occupational-health">occupational health support</a>    helps with the process.</p>
<p>Your treatment may not only affect physical functions such as
    swallowing or walking, it may also have an impact on your
    social interactions such as <a href="/help/intimacy">intimacy and sex</a>    and your <a href="/help/mental-health">mental health</a>.
    An <a href="/help/magic-triangle">interactive tool for self-assessment</a>    may help you reflect on the state of affairs and to prepare
    for clinic appointments.</p>
