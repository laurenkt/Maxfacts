<h1 id="background-to-and-purpose-of-a-medical-examination">Background to, and purpose of, a medical examination</h1>
<p>Together with the compilation of a thorough <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    and, as and when required, further <a href="/diagnosis/tests">investigations</a>    such as imaging scans or laboratory tests, a systematic medical
    examination forms the third pillar underpinning a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Whereas the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    is concerned with and assesses the <i>symptoms</i> (as reported
    by the patient) of a condition, the medical examination is
    used to look for <i>signs</i> (that can be objectively detected)
    of disease, following on from the medical history. Positive
    findings (for example, a heart murmur) and important negative
    findings (for example, absence of a wheeze for somebody suffering
    from asthma) are equally relevant in refining the overall
    picture. It is sometimes said that there is an escalation
    from subjective (history) to objective (examination) to objective-quantitative
    (laboratory and other technical investigations) findings,
    and that these should be weighted accordingly. This is too
    simplistic a view – only all of the findings combined constitute
    the features of a particular condition in a particular person
    at a particular moment in time.</p>
<p>Below we describe the procedures and processes of a medical examination
    in non-emergency situations. The same principles and procedures
    apply for a medical examination in establishing a diagnosis
    and in preparation for surgery in a pre-operative assessment
    clinic.</p>
<p>In an emergency, these approaches to evaluation and assessment
    are not appropriate, instead <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">internationally agreed protocols for dealing with emergencies</a>    are followed to quickly assess the situation and inform the
    most appropriate actions.</p>
<p>Obviously, the body area of the investigated pathology will be
    thoroughly examined.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Specific localised examination routines for symptoms commonly
        encountered in a maxillofacial clinic are described in
        our <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination/detailed">detailed page about medical examination</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>However, the purpose of a medical examination is much broader
    than merely to focus on the symptomatic region: a medical
    examination is meant to give an overall impression and to
    put a localised set of symptoms into a more holistic context.
    This is achieved by systematically examining the various
    systems of the body in addition to the symptomatic region.</p>
<p>Below we describe the most common procedures in examining the
    various body systems (regions). The extent and nature of
    these examinations should be tailored to the individual,
    and this depends on the general health of an individual and,
    in a pre-operative assessment setting, the nature of the
    planned surgical procedure. A medical examination comprises
    a general examination and further systematic examinations
    by following a sequence – looking (inspection), touching
    (palpation), tapping (percussion) and listening (auscultation).</p>
<h1 id="general-examination">General examination</h1>
<p>For a general examination, the patient must be comfortable, lying
    at about 45<sup>o</sup> and suitably exposed to allow complete
    examination of the chest and abdomen (see Figure 1).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A relaxed supine (lying on the
        back) position for clinical examination.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When determining the general status, the following questions
    need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is the patient well or unwell?</li>
    <li>Is the patient orientated or confused?</li>
    <li>What colour is the patient? Pallor (pale skin) suggests anaemia,
        is there jaundice (yellowish skin) or bluish discoloration
        of the lips and undersurface of the tongue.</li>
    <li>What is the hydration status of the patient? Dehydration
        is recognised by a dry mouth with cool, poorly perfused
        peripheries, decreased skin and tissue turgor (elasticity),
        sunken eyes and a furrowed tongue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the hands may reveal tar stains from heavy smoking, peripheral
    cyanosis (bluish discoloration), clubbing (deformity of finger
    and/or toe nails; see Figure 2) as well as alterations in
    temperature of the hands and excess moisture.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 2:</strong> Clubbing and koilonychia (abnormally
        thinned finger nails).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Working up from the hands, the radial pulse is taken, assessing
    the rate, rhythm and character of the pulse. Tachycardia
    (pulse rate above 100 beats per minute) may accompany pyrexia
    (fever), signify fluid depletion, or may simply reflect anxiety.
    Bradycardia (pulse rate below 60 beats per minute) occurs
    in patients on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">beta blockers</a>    or with certain cardiac arrhythmias (irrregular heart beat),
    but can also occur in young fit athletes. If an arrhythmia
    is suspected, it can be further investigated with an electrocardiogram,
    ECG.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 3:</strong> Positions for taking a 12-lead
        electrocardiogram, ECG, which measures the electrical
        activity of the heart.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The rhythm of the pulse can be regular, regularly irregular,
    or irregularly irregular. The character of the pulse can
    be weak and thready, or bounding after exercise or in the
    presence of a fever.</p>
<p>Another part of a general examination is to take the blood pressure
    (see Figure 4) and to take the temperature.</p>

<h1 id="systematic-examination">Systematic examination</h1>
<h2>Cardiovascular system</h2>
<p><strong>Inspection</strong> – general inspection may reveal corneal
    arcus (lipid deposits in the eye) and xanthelasma (lipid
    deposit in the skin around the eye), indicative of atherosclerotic
    disease, or clubbing (deformity of finger or toe nails) and
    central cyanosis (bluish discoloration) in patients with
    congenital cyanotic heart disease. The presence of central
    cyanosis indicates a reduction in the oxygen saturation of
    arterial blood and may be due to cardiac or respiratory disease,
    such as pulmonary oedema or chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease.</p>
<p>The jugular venous pressure is estimated (the jugular veins are
    the pair of large veins in the neck). The head is turned
    to the left looking for filling of the right internal jugular
    vein. A raised jugular venous pressure most commonly occurs
    in right sided heart failure and with fluid overload.</p>
<p><strong>Palpation</strong> – the apex beat is the most inferior
    (lowest) and lateral (sideways) point where the heart can
    be felt beating. The normal position is the 5<sup>th</sup>    intercostal space in the midclavicular line (see Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 5:</strong> Palpating the apex beat.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The apex may be displaced inferiorly and laterally because of
    cardiac enlargement. In left ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement)
    the apex beat is more forceful than normal and is described
    as heaving.</p>
<p><strong>Auscultation</strong> –  of the heart looks for abnormalities
    in rate, rhythm and the presence of additional sounds in
    the cardiac cycle, using a stethoscope. Heart murmurs arise
    due to turbulent blood flow which can be due to regurgitation
    of blood through an incompetent or leaking valve, due to
    flow through a stiff or stenotic valve, or due to flow through
    a septal defect. Additionally, flow murmurs occur when there
    is increased blood flow through normal valves; such murmurs
    are common in pregnancy and anaemia.</p>
<h2>Respiratory system</h2>
<p><strong>Inspection</strong> – may reveal signs of respiratory
    disease including finger clubbing, (often due to bronchial
    carcinoma), central cyanosis, laboured breathing, a cough
    or wheeze. The pattern of breathing may include respiratory
    effort, and the respiratory rate (normally 12-18 breaths
    per minute) may be abnormal. There may be asymmetry of chest
    wall movements;  a diseased portion of lung leads to reduced
    movement on the affected side.</p>
<p><strong>Palpation</strong> – the trachea (windpipe) is palpated
    by gently pressing the index fingers into either side of
    the sternal notch (the dip between the neck and the collarbone)
    feeling for deviation (this may be uncomfortable). Chest
    expansion is assessed by placing the hands around the ribs
    with the tips of the thumbs meeting in the midline at the
    xiphisternum (lowest part of the breastbone). The thumbs
    move apart with inspiration and the relative contribution
    of each side of the chest is determined. A similar technique
    is used when examining the posterior chest. Normal chest
    expansion is at least 5 cm.</p>
<p><strong>Percussion</strong> – the normal percussion note of the
    chest wall is described as resonant. Percussion of the chest
    is performed by placing the non-dominant hand flat on the
    chest wall, with the fingers splayed and the middle finger
    positioned over the area to be percussed. This finger is
    pressed onto the chest and struck firmly with the tip of
    the middle finger of the dominant hand, with movement at
    the wrist. The anterior (front), lateral (side) and posterior
    (back) regions of the chest are percussed symmetrically,
    comparing sides at each level (see Figure 6). The sounds
    are described as resonant (normal), dull or hyper-resonant
    (both abnormal).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 6:</strong> Percussing the chest.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Auscultation</strong> – breath sounds are assessed by
    breathing steadily in and out through the mouth. Normal breath
    sounds (also called vesicular) are due to the transmitted
    sound of turbulent air flow in the larynx (voicebox), through
    the trachea (windpipe), bronchi (airways leading into the
    lungs), and lung tissue and chest wall (see Figure 7). The
    quality of breath sounds can be reduced in intensity by airflow
    limitation, for example in chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease. Breath sounds become ‘bronchial’ when lung tissue
    becomes solidified by consolidation or fibrosis. This sound
    can be mimicked by blowing over the top of a glass bottle.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 7:</strong> Listening to the lung fields from
        behind (auscultation).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There may be additional breathing sounds, namely wheezes and
    crackles. Wheezes are musical, like a high pitched whistle,
    due to passage of air through narrow bronchi, and are characteristic
    of asthma. Crackles are non-musical sounds due to secretions
    (in which case they are reduced by coughing) or the opening
    up of collapsed small airways, usually in the lung bases,
    on inspiration (for example in pulmonary oedema). This sound
    is compared to the opening of Velcro.</p>
<h2>Gastrointestinal system</h2>
<p>Physical examination of the gastrointestinal system is confined
    to the mouth, abdomen and rectum. In order to examine the
    abdomen, patients should lie flat with their arms by their
    sides to ensure that the abdominal muscles are relaxed; nipple
    to knee exposure is required (see Figure 8).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 8:</strong> The abdomen needs to be relaxed
        and exposed for examination.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Inspection</strong> – general inspection of the gastrointestinal
    system is used to look for evidence of malignancy, malnutrition
    and chronic liver disease. Signs include jaundice, palmar
    erythema (reddening of palms of hands), leuconychia (white
    nails), bruising and purpura, gynaecomastia in males and
    spider naevi (dilated small arterioles) on the arms, face
    and upper body.</p>
<p>Inspection is commenced from the foot of the bed, looking at
    the patient as a whole and at the abdomen for obvious asymmetry,
    distension, scars or herniae. Cutaneous striae are linear
    pink or white markings on the abdomen and thighs due to pregnancy
    (stretch marks), obesity, and Cushing’s syndrome in patients
    on long term steroids.</p>
<p><strong>Palpation</strong> – the abdomen can be divided into
    nine regions to facilitate description. The right hand is
    used to gently palpate each area of the abdomen. Guarding
    is the term used to describe involuntary tensing of the abdominal
    muscles in anticipation of pain. Rebound tenderness, indicating
    peritoneal inflammation, is elicited by gently pressing on
    a region of the abdomen and then releasing the pressure,
    which causes the pain to increase. This can be simulated
    by coughing, particularly helpful in children.</p>
<p>Palpation aims to assess whether the liver, spleen and kidneys
    are enlarged. Palpation of the liver begins in the right
    iliac fossa (pelvic area): with the palm flat on the abdomen,
    the radial border of the index finger is pressed firmly inwards
    as the patient is instructed to take a deep breath (see Figure
    9).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 9:</strong> Palpation of the liver edge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is repeated moving the finger up at each breath. The smoothness
    of the liver edge, surface characteristics and any tenderness
    are noted. A common cause of liver enlargement is viral hepatitis,
    in which the liver is also tender. In cirrhosis, the liver
    is very hard and may be irregular (although in alcoholic
    cirrhosis the liver is often shrunken and impalpable). Secondary
    deposits in disseminated malignancy are associated with a
    hard, irregular liver surface.</p>
<p>The spleen enlarges towards the umbilicus (naval), and palpation
    is started in the right iliac fossa, moving up towards the
    left hypochondrium (upper abdominal region). The tips of
    the index and middle fingers of the right hand are pushed
    inwards and upwards on inspiration. Splenic enlargement occurs
    in a number of conditions, including glandular fever and
    leukaemia.</p>
<p>The kidneys are palpated bimanually in the loins, with one hand
    under the patient and the other on top, pushing the hands
    together to trap the kidney between them. Kidney enlargement
    may be compensatory after a nephrectomy (removal of a kidney),
    or due to obstruction, cystic disease, amyloidosis, myeloma
    or tumour. Generally an easily palpable kidney is abnormal.</p>
<p><strong>Percussion</strong> – organ enlargement can be confirmed
    by percussion, proceeding from resonant to dull; the percussion
    note is dull over an enlarged liver or spleen, but remains
    resonant over an enlarged kidney due to the overlying bowel
    filled with gas. In the presence of ascites (fluid in the
    peritoneal cavity), fluid accumulates in the flanks, leaving
    resonant bowel floating centrally. To elicit ascites, percussion
    is commenced in the centre of the abdomen (see Figure 10),
    working towards the left flank until the percussion note
    becomes dull. At this point, the finger is kept in the same
    position and the patient asked to roll to the right. The
    fluid redistributes by gravity, and after a few moments the
    percussion note over the same area becomes resonant. This
    is known as shifting dullness (also an unkind reference to
    a group of students).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-examination-level2-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 10:</strong> Percussion of the abdomen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Auscultation</strong> – bowel sounds are due to peristalsis
    (contractions of muscles of intestines), commonly detected
    by listening over the abdomen with the stethoscope. Absence
    of bowel sounds occurs in paralysis of the bowel wall (known
    as ileus) - this is a fairly common post-operative complication
    or following opioid use. Bowel sounds are increased and tinkling
    in bowel obstruction.</p>
<h2>Nervous system</h2>
<aside>
    <p>Assessment of head injuries as well as the examination of
        the cranial nerves (nerves in the skull) are described
        in our <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination/detailed">detailed page about medical examination</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Apart from these two tasks that belong in the maxillofacial task
    list, assessment of the nervous system includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>checking the <strong>peripheral nerves</strong> – checking
        the tone, power, reflexes, sensation and co-ordination
        of each limb assesses peripheral nerves;</li>
    <li>checking the orientation, intellectual function and speech,
        and any obvious neurological deficit, such as a facial
        palsy or hemiparesis. This examination requires co-operation
        and adjustmen to an individual’s problem, understanding,
        behaviour and intellect. If there is a suspicion of a
        dementing illness or confusional state, a short mental
        test may be in order.</li>
</ul>
