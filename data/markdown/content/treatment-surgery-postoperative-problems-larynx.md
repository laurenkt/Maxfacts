<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the larynx (voice
    box), after laryngectomy (removal of the voice box) include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inability to speak. Special techniques can be learned and
        adopted with the help of speech and language therapy,
        <a href="/help/salt">SALT</a>.</li>
    <li>Becoming a ‘neck breather’. Social networks are usually developed
        locally with specialist nurse facilitators to adapt to
        this physical challenge.</li>
    <li>Lack of filtration and humidification of air. A number of
        devices to aid this are available.</li>
    <li>In the event of sudden collapse, emergency ‘mouth to mouth’
        resuscitation is fruitless as air must be delivered via
        the tracheostome. An alert to this may be helpful.</li>
</ul>
