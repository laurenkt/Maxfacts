<p>Corrective jaw surgery, orthognathic surgery, is mainly concerned
    with repositioning of the jaws (and teeth) to improve function
    by correcting disproportionate growth and realigning the
    jaws (and teeth).</p>
<p>Realigning of the jaws necessitates bony cuts to, and corrective
    moves of, parts of the mandible (lower jaw) or maxilla (upper
    jaw), or both. The process may include other procedures such
    as removal of third molars (wisdom teeth), insertion of
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implants</a>, or rarely some <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">bone grafting</a>.
        Correction of the jaw proportions is likely to also have
        an effect on facial appearance and may alleviate some
        breathing difficulties and/or sleep apnoea.</p>
<p>Some minor orthodontic alignment of teeth after orthognathic
    surgery may still be necessary – but at this stage may well
    be seen as the ‘finishing touches’ of a lengthy process.</p>
