<p>Having discussed general aspects of excision and repair of facial
    skin malignancies in the previous section, the following
    will provide some more specific comments about excision for
    basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
    and melanoma. Then we discuss repair strategies by <i>local</i>    flaps in the different facial regions.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Information about reconstruction with <i>remote</i> flaps
        or grafts is on our pages about <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">surgical reconstruction</a>        .</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="surgical-excision-of-bcc-scc-and-malignant-melanoma">Surgical excision of BCC, SCC and malignant melanoma</h1>
<p><strong>BCCs</strong> are excised with a margin of 4 to 5 mm,
    although those with poorly defined margins are more difficult
    to judge and may need a wider margin. The use of Mohs’ micrographic
    surgery (after Frederic E. Mohs, 1938) can be useful in certain
    anatomical sites to determine clearance whilst minimising
    the extent of resection. Mohs’ surgery involves excision
    with chemical cauterisation and multiple repeat <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsies</a>    of the specimen until the margins are tumour free. Popular
    in the USA, the procedure is time consuming and costly, but
    it does offer advantages in the treatment of ill-defined
    morphoeic (infiltrative) BCCs and those encroaching free
    margins in the nasal and eye regions. Various modifications
    of this technique, using frozen sections or conventional
    histology, have been used to fit local resources. For example,
    in difficult cases a two-stage approach can be used leaving
    the wound dressed until histopathology is available. Final
    pathology results, looking carefully at the resection margins,
    can be reviewed prior to <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    as further marginal resections may be necessary.</p>
<p>In more straight forward cases, frozen section can be used to
    assess completion of resection. In these cases the resection
    and reconstruction can be performed as a one-stage procedure,
    following common clinical margin and <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction techniques</a>.</p>
<p>Indications for Mohs’ surgery include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tumour site (especially central face, around the eyes, nose,
        lips, ear)</li>
    <li>Tumour size (&gt; 2 cm)</li>
    <li>Some histological subtypes (especially morphoeic, infiltrative,
        micronodular, basosquamous subtypes)</li>
    <li>Poor clinical definition of tumour margins</li>
    <li>Recurrent lesions</li>
    <li>Perineural or perivascular involvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>For incompletely excised BCCs, there are various prospective
    and retrospective reviews that suggest that <i>not all</i>    tumours will recur. Despite this, conventional wisdom decrees
    that tumours which have been incompletely excised, especially
    lesions incompletely excised at the deep margin, are all
    at high risk of recurrence<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCCs and melanomas</strong> are excised more widely.
    The margin for excision for melanomas has decreased over
    the years as prospective trials have shown no disadvantage
    in the outcome with smaller margins. Current guidelines indicate
    margins of 1 to 3 cm, depending on the depth and size of
    the melanoma, and even below 1 cm in important anatomical
    regions such as the face.</p>
<h1 id="reconstruction-of-the-scalp">Reconstruction of the scalp</h1>
<p>The scalp is a relatively inelastic structure due to the presence
    of the galea aponeurotica (connective tissue that forms the
    middle layer of the scalp) and large flaps are required to
    reconstruct small defects. Should flaps be required to reconstruct
    large defects or maintain hairlines, then <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">tissue expansion</a>    prior to flap surgery is an option (see Figure 1 for an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Top: an unaesthetic skin-grafted
        area after trauma, before tissue expansion; middle: during
        tissue expansion of the scalp; bottom: after covering
        the area.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Alternatively very large flaps can be used bilaterally to allow
    sufficient laxity for closure (see Figure 2 for an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Top: an excision defect of the
        scalp; bottom: the large flaps raised to close the defect
        because of the limited mobility of the tightly adherent
        scalp.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Many scalp lesions are treated with surgical excision below the
    galea layer. In this instance the pericranium (membrane that
    covers the skull) should be preserved to allow reconstruction
    with <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin grafts</a>.
    If this is not possible grafting onto bone can be successful
    if the dense cortical bone is removed and the graft placed
    in contact with diploe (spongy cancellous bone layer of the
    skull). <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">Different types of skin grafts</a>    (full thickness of split thickness grafts) are available
    for large and small defects.</p>
<h1 id="reconstruction-of-the-forehead">Reconstruction of the forehead</h1>
<p>The forehead has characteristics of both the face and the scalp.
    In general, primary closure or local flaps are preferred
    in the management of defects here. As the skin is relatively
    tight, forehead laxity should be assessed prior to designing
    flaps as there is significant interpatient variation. Skin
    grafts on the upper forehead are acceptable, but flaps designed
    to match the horizontal lines of the forehead or the vertical
    lines that originate from the glabella region often give
    best results. Advancement flaps make maximum use of the horizontal
    creases and blend in, giving good aesthetic results (see
    Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> All lesions of the middle of the
        forehead can be closed by bilateral advancement flaps
        resting into vertical skin tension lines as shown in
        this before (top), during (middle) and after (bottom)
        treatment sequence.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The anatomical position of the branches of the facial nerve can
    usually be predicted throughout the face, so that this structure
    can be spared whenever possible. It is acceptable to sacrifice
    the nerve if it is involved by the tumour (generally when
    it is not working). It is not acceptable for the facial nerve
    to be damaged in the flap surgery. Detailed knowledge of
    where the facial nerve branches lie in relation to musculature,
    the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">superficial musculoaponeurotic system layer and the other fascial structures of the face</a>    is vital. It is also good practice to lift facial flaps in
    the layers above those which contain sensory branches of
    the trigeminal nerve, so as not to create areas of anaesthesia
    beyond the surgical wounds.</p>
<p>If the facial nerve is damaged in the resection of the tumour,
    then the predicted deformity due to lack of muscle action
    can in part be corrected by careful design of the flap and/or
    suspension of the tissues with permanent, buried periosteal
    sutures (flap anchored to the membrane covering bone).</p>
<h1 id="reconstruction-of-the-temple">Reconstruction of the temple</h1>
<p>The temple often has <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">sufficient spare tissue for local flaps</a>,
    such as the rhomboid flap (larger lesions may require
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin grafting</a>). Figure 4 shows an example before and
        after treatment.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The outline of the rhomboid flap
        and its use in treating basal cell cancer of the temple;
        before (left) and after (right) treatment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The use of the round block suture for larger lesions, particularly
    those that involve the hairline, can minimise the defect.
    This circumferential suture acts like a purse string in reducing
    the defect significantly when tightened (see Figure 5 for
    illustration).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The original surgical defect (top)
        and the postoperative result of a round block purse-string
        suture technique.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Depending on tissue laxity this circumferential suture can either
    completely close the defect, or it can be used to reduce
    the defect by 50 to 60 %, so allowing a smaller skin graft
    to be used centrally. It has the advantage of pulling the
    hairline into a more anatomically correct position. The significant
    cutaneous deformities that result initially from this stitch
    gradually disappear as the skin relaxes. The stitch is usually
    retained for at least two weeks if a skin graft is used,
    or four weeks and more if complete closure is the desired
    result. This method of closure is a simple procedure that
    is particularly applicable in the temple, cheeks and neck
    with lax skin, typically in more elderly people.</p>
<h1 id="reconstruction-of-the-cheek">Reconstruction of the cheek</h1>
<p>The cheek is a relatively safe area in which to practice cutaneous
    surgery as the skin is lax with favourable lines, particularly
    the junction lines, which hide scars well. These include
    the nasofacial, nasolabial and preauricular areas. The treatment
    of mid-cheek lesions has to take advantage of resting skin
    tension lines to minimise the aesthetic impact. This is particularly
    important in the younger cheek, which has fewer lines in
    which to hide the surgical incisions and resultant scars.</p>
<p>The cheek is frequently considered in three subunits: the preauricular
    cheek, the medial cheek, and the mid-cheek.</p>
<p>Reconstructive options vary according to these sites. In general
    the cheek has a significant amount of subcutaneous fat, which
    makes surgery relatively safe and the inherent elasticity
    of the cheek allows all forms of flaps to be undertaken,
    limited only by individual patient factors. The flaps are
    based on the vascular perfusion pressures of those vessels
    present within the flap base extending to its tip and not
    a simple length <i>versus</i> width formula (see Figure 6
    for an example of a large rotation flap).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The preoperative (left), short-term
        post-operative (middle) and long-term post-operative
        (right) results of a large cheek rotation flap on the
        right cheek.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The medial cheek, as it meets the nose, is a common site for
    BCCs and the subcutaneously based triangular advancement
    flap is frequently useful (see Figure 7). This flap has the
    skin cut in a triangular fashion but with its deep connections
    via the subcutaneous fat being left intact. The laxity of
    the base allows advancement of the flap based on the subcutaneous
    pedicle and careful closure in a V-Y fashion.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The preoperative (left), short-term
        postoperative (middle) and long-term post-operative (right)
        results of a subcutaneously based triangular advancement
        flap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Transposition flaps are frequently used on the cheek and careful
    assessment of where the scars will lie needs to be made to
    maximise the number of scars that will lie within the lines
    of relaxed skin tension.</p>
<p>Flaps in the region of the eyelid may need periosteal suspension
    sutures, which take up the tension within the flap to prevent
    excessive pull upon the lax tissue of the eyelid that can
    result in ectropion (drooping eyelid).</p>
<h1 id="reconstruction-of-the-ear">Reconstruction of the ear</h1>
<p>The ear is morphologically complex, composed of skin and underlying
    cartilage, both of which are important for function and appearance.
    Significant tissue loss at the margins is particularly noticeable.
    Surprisingly, if the structure and shape of the ear can be
    maintained a reduction in size can often pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>Central defects of the ear should be repaired with <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">full thickness skin grafting</a>    as a simple and effective reconstruction so long as the support
    for the margins is maintained.</p>
<p>Wedge excision of defects of the rim (helix) of the ear can be
    successful, but this should only be used for small defects
    which allow tension-free closure and no cupping or shape
    distortion of the ear due to tensions within the cartilage.
    Larger defects of the helix and other tissues of the ear
    are best addressed with rim or chondrocutaneous advancement
    flaps with an intact posterior skin pedicle providing the
    vascularity (see Figure 8). This allows reconstruction of
    the ear with a relatively normal shape, albeit somewhat smaller.
    One of the functions of the external ear is to act as a support
    for an individual’s glasses, it is easy to forget how important
    this can be.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Technique of rim advancement reconstruction
        of the ear after excision of skin cancer (clockwise from
        top left to bottom left).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Pedicle flaps from areas of lax tissue in the postauricular sulcus
    or the neck are possible and can reconstruct larger defects
    of the rim in two-stage techniques if rim advancements are
    not possible.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of the whole ear is a major undertaking and can
    either be addressed by a multistage surgical technique involving
    cartilage from another source, for example the rib, followed
    by soft tissue cover obtained from the temporoparietal region.
    This specialist service requires experience and is undertaken
    in only a few centres. Osseo-integrated implant-borne prosthetic
    reconstruction of the ear is frequently successful and is
    a cheaper and easier option.</p>
<h1 id="reconstruction-of-the-nose">Reconstruction of the nose</h1>
<p>This is one of the most challenging areas of the face to reconstruct
    and a variety of flaps may be used according to the site
    and extent of the tumour and which cosmetic subunits are
    involved in the tumour and the respective repair. Reconstruction
    should consider not only the skin of the nose, but the underlying
    structure including bone, cartilage and muscle, which are
    crucial for the maintenance of its respiratory function.
    Full thickness defects of the nose must involve internal
    and external reconstruction.</p>
<p>Mobile skin is at a premium on the nose with little being available
    towards the tip because of its fibrosebaceous nature and
    a relative absence of subcutaneous fat. The upper two thirds
    of the nose has slightly more mobile skin that may be used
    for primary closure or local flaps. Interpersonal variability
    in the amount of lax skin is common and every patient should
    be assessed by the simple method of pinching the skin to
    see what is potentially available. It is vital to maintain
    the free margins of the nose, particularly the alar rims,
    so that elevation or distortion does not occur. Despite the
    limited tissue available for local flaps, reconstruction
    of nasal defects is best undertaken with these procedures
    as this allows the return of normal contour, colour and texture.
    If a local flap is not feasible <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">full thickness skin grafts</a>    are used.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">Bilobed flaps</a>    (see Figure 9) and dorsal nasal rotation flaps are useful,
    but must be designed not to transgress the junction lines
    of the face or obtund the natural creases and hollows. The
    face, particularly around the nose and its junction with
    the cheeks, is a series of hills and valleys and flaps which
    cross the valleys, from one cosmetic unit to another, have
    the potential disadvantage of leaving a bridge across a sulcus
    which immediately catches the eye and appears abnormal in
    comparison to the unaffected side.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Use of the bilobed flap to repair
        nasal defects following excision of basal cell carcinoma
        in a young woman (clockwise from top left to bottom left).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Large or structurally complex defects which cannot be reconstructed
    by grafts or local flaps call for a transfer of tissue from
    a nearby cosmetic unit utilising a two-stage technique where
    the tissue is transferred on a pedicle and allowed to regain
    a blood supply at the recipient site for several weeks before
    second stage division and insetting of the flap. The intervening
    pedicle is sacrificed and the site of donation of tissue
    is either closed primarily or with a skin graft.</p>
<p>This is illustrated very clearly by the paramedian forehead flap
    based on the supratrochlear artery, which is the flap of
    choice for reconstruction of large and complex nasal defects
    following cancer surgery (see Figure 10).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> A larger basal cell carcinoma
        of the nose (top left) that required complete excision
        of the aesthetic lobules and reconstruction with the
        two-stage paramedian forehead flap (top right and bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cartilaginous grafts can be inset within the layers of the flap
    to give structural support to the nose. If a full thickness
    defect has been created, the inner aspect of the flap can
    be skin grafted or have a mucosal flap placed upon it from
    within the nose to complete the reconstruction. Division
    at 3 to 5 weeks occurs when the revascularisation has completed.
    The longer it is left, the safer sculpting of the flap will
    be. Alar rim reconstruction frequently (see Figure 11) requires
    a third stage for the in-turned flap which reconstructs the
    curved alar rim. This often needs delayed tertiary trimming,
    which cannot be undertaken at the second stage because of
    the risk to the vascularity of the flap.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> When reconstructing the alar
        rim with the paramedian forehead flap, a third stage
        is required to thin the flap and sculpt the alar rim
        aesthetically.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Medial canthal or lateral nasal bridge defects can be reconstructed
    using transposition flaps from the glabella region, which
    are designed to adapt to the concave area of the lateral
    nose and the medial canthal region. The use of thermoplastic
    nasal splints to hold the flap into position until suture
    removal improves the appearance.</p>
<p>As with the ear, an implant-retained prosthesis following rhinectomy
    can have very satisfactory results and may obviate complex
    two-flap surgery.</p>
<h1 id="reconstruction-of-lip-and-chin">Reconstruction of lip and chin</h1>
<p>Treatment of cancers of the oral lip are discussed in the corresponding
    section about <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer">mouth cancer</a>.
    Both lips are free margins; therefore avoidance of distortion
    presents the greatest challenge. Many landmarks exist on
    the lips which, if altered, may cause disfigurement. Wedge
    excision with primary closure will minimise deformity when
    possible. Similarly, facial grooves and folds (nasolabial,
    melolabial) can be blunted by otherwise effective and useful
    flaps (see Figure 12). This effect may be minimised by periosteal
    sutures to try to create a new groove.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> The superiorly based nasiolabal
        flap (left) while filling the created defect, blunts
        the nasolabial fold (right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cutaneous defects are often treated with advancement flaps in
    the upper lip, such as bilateral advancement flaps or the
    subcutaneous triangular advancement flap (see Figure 13),
    which is particularly useful for lateral upper lip lesions
    close to the nasolabial or meliolabial fold. For centrally
    placed defects in the lip the best option is the perialar
    crescentic advancement flap, which can be used both unilaterally
    and bilaterally to reconstruct difficult larger defects.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed/figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> The subcutaneous island advancement
        flap for upper lip reconstruction (left and middle),
        and the result after 3 months (right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The lower lip has the same problems and reconstructive considerations
    as the upper lip and any advancement flap should take note
    of the mentolabial crease in the design of advancement and
    rotation flaps.</p>
<p>The chin is a separate cosmetic unit. Flap design must take into
    account the inter-relationship between chin and lower lip,
    so that repair of one does not compromise the other (see
    Figure 14). Rotation flaps utilising the mentolabial crease
    or flaps utilising the crease at the cheek/chin junction
    offer the best results in this difficult and inelastic area.
    Design of these flaps must be considered carefully and often
    increased in size in order to diminish any vertical tension.</p>
