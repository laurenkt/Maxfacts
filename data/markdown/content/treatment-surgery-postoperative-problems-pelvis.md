<p>Postoperative problems affecting the pelvis (part of the hip)
    can be remedied as follows</p>
<ul>
    <li>Appearance. This can range from minimal (if a tiny tube of
        bone has been taken) to extensive if a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">large bone graft or flap</a>        was taken which can leave a long, sometimes itchy scar.
        Wound care using <a href="/help/physiotherapy">massage</a>,
        pressure, silicone in gels or sheets can all help.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Pain</a> and discomfort
        with a limp. You are likely to walk with a limp for a
        variable amount of time depending on the amount of bone
        removed and muscles interfered with. You may need aids
        to walking for the first few days. <a href="/help/physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</a>        is a key part of recovery.</li>
    <li>Difficulty with bowel movement and passing urine. This is
        usually because of discomfort or constipation created
        by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">opioid painkillers</a>.
        Laxatives are important aides with this.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>.
        Particularly with large bone grafts or flaps the sensory
        nerve to the upper thigh may be damaged and leave the
        area numb. Counter-irritation techniques may help.</li>
</ul>
