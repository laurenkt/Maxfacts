<p>This section covers craniofacial implants that is; implants which
    act as ‘anchors’ for prosthetic replacements for ears, eyes
    and noses. <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">Dental implants</a>    are considerably more technically demanding, as they have
    both the challenging environment of the mouth and the functional
    loads of biting and chewing to cope with.</p>
<p>Craniofacial implants generally have shorter lengths as the depth
    of bone into which they can be inserted is limited (having
    a titanium screw connecting the brain to a plastic ear would
    not have a good long-term prognosis).</p>
<p>Craniofacial implants may be adapted with either magnets or retentive
    buttons, or in some instances custom fitted bars to provide
    retention and anchorage points for the ear, eye or nasal
    prosthesis being used.</p>
<p>The fact that these replacement body parts can be fabricated
    in the laboratory means that very high standards of aesthetics
    can be achieved (considerably better than that by surgery
    using autologous body parts such as cartilage and skin to
    rebuild these missing body parts). Craniofacial implants
    are, of course, non-functional.</p>
