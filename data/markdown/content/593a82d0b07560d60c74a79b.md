<p>Irrespective of the type of malignant skin lesion (BCC, SCC or
    melanoma), the strategy for surgical removal is similar for
    all types with only minor differences (for example regarding
    margins of excision). The major determining factors about
    the best surgical resection and repair strategy are size
    and location of the tumour and risk of metastases.</p>
<p>Many of the general considerations described below are also relevant
    for the resection and repair of <a href="/treatment/surgery/benign-lump">benign lumps</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage">soft tissue wounds from trauma</a>.</p>
<aside>
    <p>More specific information about the surgical treatment of
        the different types of facial skin cancers in the various
        facial locations can be found on our detailed page about
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed">treatment of facial skin cancer</a>        .</p>

<p>Excision of all skin cancers involves the deeper tissues as well
    as peripheral skin around the lesion, and this is of great
    significance in the head and neck region. Deep excision on
    the trunk or legs is straightforward as the subcutaneous
    layer of fat is considerable and will allow excision margins
    to be easily achieved without involving important nearby
    structures. This is not the case on the face, scalp or neck
    where margins of excisions will be affected by the close
    proximity of vital structures. These include the facial nerve,
    the eye and free margins (such as the eyelids), the lips
    and the alar rim of the nose. Another limitation is the limited
    depth of tissues available for excision such as on the scalp.
    Achieving an adequate margin of clearance around and beneath
    a tumour on the face may involve a smaller than recommended
    margin in order to preserve important structures and minimise
    aesthetic damage. It is, however, <i>not</i> sensible to
    plan an excision which will leave a macroscopically positive
    margin.</p>
<p>The majority of skin cancers on the head and neck may be surgically
    treated under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local anaesthesia</a>    with or without sedation. A smaller group (about 30 % in
    major units) will require <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>    for the surgery and <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>.</p>
<h1 id="repair-of-the-surgical-defects">Repair of the surgical defects</h1>
<p>Excision of a lesion unavoidably leads to surgical defects. Depending
    on size and location of the defect(s), there are a number
    of options in healing the defect(s). These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Healing by secondary intention (no repair)</li>
    <li>Primary closure</li>
    <li>Local tissue transfer with random or axial flaps</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">Skin grafting</a></li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">Remote tissue transfer with free flaps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A particular reconstructive technique may offer a clearly superior
    result, but if not the simplest choice is usually the best
    one.</p>
<aside>
    <p>More information about surgical reconstruction techniques
        using tissue from <i>remote</i> body parts, such as skin
        grafting of free soft tissue flaps, is on our detailed
        pages about <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Below we only discuss general aspects of healing by secondary
    intention (no repair), briefly comment on primary closure
    (more information about options and techniques is given in
    the sections dealing with the treatment and repair of
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage">trauma wounds</a>) and finally discuss in slightly more detail
        surgical repair techniques involving <i>local</i> flaps.
        The latter techniques are of particular importance in
        the treatment of facial skin cancers.</p>
<h2>Healing by secondary intention (no repair)</h2>
<p>It has been shown that secondary intention healing can give excellent
    functional and cosmetic results, particularly if used for
    small defects in concave regions. This technique may also
    be useful in larger areas where contraction of the wound
    during healing is not cosmetically or functionally important.
    The longer healing time, increased wound care and poorer
    cosmesis must be taken into account when judging the appropriateness
    of this technique (see Figure 1 for an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info/figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Top: basal cell carcinoma of the
        nasal base before treatment by excision; bottom: after
        healing by secondary intention.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Primary closure</h2>
<p>Primary closure, for example by various suture techniques, allows
    quick reconstruction, rapid healing and a linear scar and
    is often the simplest reconstructive approach. If the technique
    can be accomplished without significant tension across the
    wound and with the suture line lying in the lines of relaxed
    skin tension or favourable skin line, then this approach
    may well be the best available.</p>
<p>Any distortion of free margins or an anatomical subunit within
    the face, as well as the creation of long linear lines of
    poor aesthetic appearance would be an indication to consider
    another reconstructive option. Figure 2 outlines the (symmetrical)
    cosmetic units of the face.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The cosmetic units of the face.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With primary closure (and other techniques) it is important to
    keep in mind the stages of wound healing and the physical
    changes that will occur with time after the surgery: improvement
    will be slow as the wounds heal and the scars develop and
    mature over a period of about one year (there is an old proverb
    in German: ‘Die Zeit heilt alle Wunden’, meaning time heals
    all wounds, but indirectly pointing out that patience is
    required).</p>
<h2>Local tissue transfer with random or axial flaps</h2>
<p>A local flap is tissue from an adjacent area of surplus tissue
    (such as skin plus subcutaneous fat) that is moved such that
    it covers a surgical defect in such a way that still allows
    closure of the donor site. Flaps carry their blood supply
    with them, either from an identified major blood vessel (an
    axial flap) or randomly from multiple smaller blood vessels
    (a random flap). Local flaps offer significant advantages
    in facial reconstruction. Disadvantages are that flaps require
    additional incisions, and tissue movements can distort skin
    and may lead to increased complications. These flaps certainly
    require greater surgical skill, knowledge and practice. Potential
    disadvantages of local flaps are more than compensated for
    by their advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>they can cover bare bone, tendon and cartilage</li>
    <li>tissue bulk can be restored, with similar tissue</li>
    <li>avoidance of distortion of free margins within the cosmetic
        subunits</li>
    <li>frequently aesthetically superior</li>
</ul>
<p>When assessing a skin cancer for repair, the site and the resulting
    defect that will occur following its excision have to be
    thought through. The surgeon draws on the patient with a
    skin marker pen (before any local anaesthetic is given –
    it distorts the tissues) first the visible extent of the
    tumour margin and then the surgical excision margins. This
    gives both the surgeon and the patient a visual impression
    of the defect and clarity regarding the procedure.</p>
<p>Some of this planning may be initially disheartening because
    of seemingly excessive cut lines and large defects and flap.
    Documentation and photographs of medium and long term results
    for similar lesions and procedures will help to pick up the
    spirits.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Several such examples can be found on our detailed page about
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/detailed">treatment of facial skin cancer</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Perhaps even more importantly, an understanding of the ideas
    and basic principles of using local flaps for facial reconstruction
    provides a good grasp of the likely reasonable functional
    and aesthetic result, as well as giving confidence and tolerance
    of such procedures for patients. With this in mind, we next
    discuss some basic principles of raising and moving local
    flaps.</p>
<p>Design of local flaps should take into account the natural facial
    lines, junction lines between cosmetic units (see Figure
    2, above) and the lines of relaxed skin tension. Placing
    the resultant scars in these lines achieves camouflage wherever
    possible. An irregular pattern of scars is often less noticeable
    than a long linear scar and local flaps allow reconstruction
    with adjacent tissue of similar colour, texture and thickness.</p>
<p>Figure 3 represents the concept of reservoirs of facial spare
    tissue. Each individual varies, but the temple, cheeks, jowl,
    nasolabial area and glabella (the area between the eyebrows,
    above the nose) are characteristic reservoirs of excess tissue,
    available for local flaps.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info/figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The reservoirs of ‘lax’ tissue
        that can be mobilised for facial flaps.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The judgement involved in flap surgery is to assess how much
    tissue can safely be moved from one site to another whilst
    allowing closure of the donor site, preferably in a line
    of relaxed skin tension. Cosmetic or aesthetic units can
    be further divided into sub-units. Examples are the nose,
    eyelids, cheeks and temples (see Figure 2). From a surgical
    viewpoint, the importance lies in trying to reconstruct defects
    with tissue raised within the same unit and wherever possible
    avoiding moving tissue across a well-defined junction line
    from one unit to another.</p>
<p>The junction lines represent the areas between the cosmetic units
    and, along with visible wrinkle lines and those lines seen
    in facial expression, allow scar placement with maximum disguise.
    However, relaxed skin tension lines are not always visible
    and may not always coincide with somebody’s visible lines.
    These lines indicate the directional pull that exists in
    relaxed skin, and surgical incisions should be in parallel
    with these lines.</p>
<h2>Tissue movement with local flaps</h2>
<p>Classically there are three basic types of tissue movement in
    flap surgery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>rotation</li>
    <li>advancement</li>
    <li>transposition</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 4 illustrates the principle of a simple rotation flap,
    suitable to cover a wedge-shape defect. The length of the
    incision line needs to considerably exceed the length of
    the short side of the defect (by about three to four times),
    the flap is rotated toward the far long side of the defect.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info/figure4.png">

        top left: defect and incision lines; top right: raising
        the flap; bottom right: moving the flap; bottom left:
        resulting scar lines.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 5 illustrates an advancement flap, together with a generally
    useful clever trick to ease movement of flaps and to ensure
    smooth wound closure – Burow’s triangle (named after its
    inventor Karl Heinrich Burow, a 19<sup>th</sup> century Prussian
    surgeon and ophthalmologist who had an interest in the treatment
    of open wounds), the additional excision of small triangles
    of tissue at suitable locations and angles to ease movement
    of the flap. An advancement flap involves movement of the
    flap in a straight line in order to cover the defect.</p>

        triangles (Burow’s triangles) of excised skin and subcutaneous
        fat are placed at the far end of the incision lines at
        angles that ensure smooth movement and transition of
        the flap; top right: raising the flap; bottom right:
        moving the flap; bottom left: resulting scar lines.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A rhomboid-shaped defect can be covered by a rhomboid flap (Figure
    6). The geometry of a rhombus allows for a particularly versatile
    repair and coverage approach: the defect can be covered by
    a flap from the direction of any of the four sides of the
    rhombus. The flap movement involved is a transposition of
    the raised flap.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info/figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> A rhomboid flap. Clockwise from
        top left: defect and incision lines; top right: raising
        the flap; bottom right: moving the flap; bottom left:
        resulting scar lines.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A bilobed flap is most suitable to cover circular defects (Figure
    7). It consists of two (connected) sections, the larger of
    which is moved / rotated to cover the adjacent defect, the
    smaller section follows the movement and is used to cover
    the defect left behind by moving the first section to cover
    the defect. The defect left in the end by the second section
    is small enough and suitable for primary closure.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info/figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> A bilobed flap. Clockwise from
        top left: defect and incision lines; top right: raising
        the flap sections; bottom right: moving the flap sections;
        bottom left: resulting scar lines.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are numerous, more elaborate local flap schemes, including
    combinations of flaps into sophisticated patterns that allow
    for equally sophisticated repair schemes.</p>
<p>Frequently flaps show combinations of different movements. When
    tissue is moved from one site to another, as well as the
    primary movement of the flap itself, there is a secondary
    movement of adjacent tissue to which it is sewn as the flap
    pulls that tissue toward it. The consequences of this pull
    and secondary movement are particularly important when flaps
    are close to free or distortable margins, such as eyelids
    (see Figure 8), lips or the nasal rim, so that this pull
    does not cause anatomical distortion.</p>
