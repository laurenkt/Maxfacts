<p>Getting food texture right for individual needs can make all
    the difference between enjoying food and being unable/unwilling
    to eat. There is no simple one-size-fits-all answer to this
    challenge, individual needs vary widely and it is important
    to investigate what works – and what doesn’t. This may have
    to be repeated over time because needs tend to change over
    time.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to find out about these individual needs, to
    learn what is safe and enjoyable to eat, not just because
    of the need to feed the body but also for hugely important
    reasons of improving quality of life. The speech and language
    therapist (<a href="/help/salt">SALT</a>) is the specialist
    who will normally help to assess the best food textures to
    try, and will also monitor changes over time.</p>
<p>It would be very wrong to believe that the choice is just between
    survival on power drinks or relying on a <a href="/help/non-oral-food">feeding tube</a>,
    or that the only way to thicken liquids would be to add instantaneous
    thickening agents (which are mainly a matter of convenience
    in many care settings but do not necessarily produce an enjoyable
    texture &amp; taste). We hope that a look at our <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes/browse">recipes</a>,
    <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">cooking videos</a>    and other <a href="/help/oral-food">information about oral food intake</a>,
    including a collection of <a href="/help/oral-food/practical-tips">practical tips</a>    will convince you that there are endless possibilities.</p>
<h1 id="some-general-trends-for-suitable-textures-and-consistencies">Some general trends for suitable textures and consistencies</h1>
<p>The complicated and multi-step process of <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowing</a>    and the important role of <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">saliva</a>    in this process suggest some general trends (with wide individual
    variation) for suitable food textures and consistencies when
    parts of the swallowing process are hampered:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Difficulty controlling bolus</strong>: smooth textures,
        homogenous consistency, thickened liquids recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may happen after surgery in the floor of the mouth limits
    free movement of the tip of the tongue either in the short
    term because of discomfort (as when a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">ranula</a>    is removed), or if an excision has been performed and the
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    does not allow full mobility.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Difficulty controlling / moving base of tongue / floor of mouth</strong>:
        smooth textures, homogenous consistency, lubricated foods,
        slippery foods recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatments affecting the base of the tongue range from <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">laser excisions</a>    (where the immobility may improve) or <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/application/detailed">post-radiotherapy fibrosis</a>    (where there tends to be little improvement) to complete
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">replacement with a flap after total glossectomy</a>    (removal of the tongue, which requires a completely new method
    of swallowing to be learnt).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reduced / malfunctioning swallowing reflex</strong>:
        temperature stimulus – alternate mouthfuls of hot and
        cold foods, possibly taste / flavour stimulus might also
        work (exploiting smell – cinnamon and vanilla tried and
        tested).</li>
</ul>
<p>Surgery to the lateral pharynx (throat), or treatment or disease
    which encroaches the pterygoid plexus of nerves (group of
    nerves which control the largely involuntary <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">pharyngeal component of swallowing</a>)
    may disrupt this reflex.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Treatments disturbing taste:</strong> can range from
        laser excisions where the taste buds are damaged, or
        quite simple surgery which may cause damage to the lingual
        nerve which carries taste fibres (removing a third molar
        tooth can do this), to high dose <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">chemoradiotherapy</a>        which will effectively destroy all taste buds in the
        exposed fields.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Poorly sealed airway or nasal cavity</strong>: requires
        thickening of liquids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hemimaxillectomy (removal of a large part of the upper jaw) with
    an <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">obturator</a>    that doesn’t fit perfectly, or removal of a <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems">submandibular (salivary) gland</a>    which causes an inadvertent weakness of the marginal mandibular
    branch of the facial nerve (which moves the lower lip) means
    the lips have difficulty sealing to allow the increase in
    intraoral <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">pressure necessary to swallow</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Weak muscles in pharynx (upper part of throat) and/or upper oesophagus (gullet)</strong>:
        soft and slippery foods (gliding easily and rapidly)
        recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</a> to the posterior
    oropharynx and neck following cancer treatment is a likely
    cause.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Problems with uvula and soft palate</strong>: thickened
        liquids, otherwise slippery homogenous foods (gliding
        easily) recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Commonly in pre-treated <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate/more-info">cleft palate</a>,
    sometimes seen after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for treatment
    of snoring and sleep apnoea. After resection of soft palate
    for tumours.</p>
<h1 id="some-other-general-trends">Some other general trends</h1>
<p>Some physiological properties can be exploited to optimise the
    texture and consistency of food to ease swallowing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>if tolerated: acidic foods stimulate <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">saliva production</a>;</li>
    <li>salty foods tend to make saliva less viscous;</li>
    <li>sweet foods and dairy products make saliva more viscous;</li>
    <li>if relevant: solid foods activate the reflex for chewing;</li>
    <li>cold or frozen foods are more intensely noticed in the oral
        cavity and the pharynx.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our detailed page about the adaption of <a href="/help/oral-food/texture-adaption/detailed">food textures and consistencies</a>    revisits the topic in more detail, looking at it from the
    different food textures we can prepare in flexible ways.
    Combined with our collections of <a href="/help/oral-food/practical-tips">practical tips around eating and cooking</a>    and <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes/browse">recipes in our searchable database</a>,
    this should make for enjoyable and tasty meals for almost
    everybody!</p>
