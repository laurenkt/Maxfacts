<p>The major salivary glands consist of three sets of paired major
    glands: the two parotid glands (near the angle of the mandible),
    the two submandibular glands (beneath the mandible) and the
    two sublingual glands (beneath the floor of the mouth) and,
    in addition, many minor salivary glands which are scattered
    submucosally (under the lining), throughout the mouth, oropharynx
    (throat), palate and occasionally the nose.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about location and structure of
        the salivary glands, this general information is in our
        section about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The salivary glands are prone to a variety of conditions and
    diseases, including</p>
<ul>
    <li>rare developmental disorders such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">developmental cysts</a>        and very common conditions such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">traumatically induced cysts</a></li>
    <li>obstructive disease, mainly afflicting the ducts from the
        glands (about 80 % of salivary gland calculi (stones)
        occur in the ducts of the submandibular gland)</li>
    <li>acute and chronic <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bacterial infections</a></li>
    <li>viral infection (mumps)</li>
    <li>autoimmune disease - Sjögren’s syndrome</li>
    <li>a huge and bewildering range of neoplasms (tumours), the
        majority of which are benign (not malignant). <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">Malignant salivary gland tumours</a>        are very rare, with an incidence in Europe of 1.2 per
        100,000.</li>
</ul>
