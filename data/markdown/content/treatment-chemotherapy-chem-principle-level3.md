<p>We sketch the predominant working mechanisms of the three main
    types of cytotoxic agents used in the treatment of head and
    neck cancers: DNA cross linking agents, antimetabolites and
    protein inhibitors. All of these and additional mechanisms
    are known in great detail and are the subject of ongoing
    research. We refer to the ample <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/further-reading">scientific and medical literature</a>    for detailed descriptions and ongoing discussions of chemotherapy
    drugs and their properties. Please keep in mind that chemotherapy
    plays a less prominent role in the treatment of head and
    neck cancers than for other malignancies.</p>
<p>The following merely gives a coarse picture, an impression of
    the main underlying biochemical and physiological principles
    that make these various agents cytotoxic and thus suitable
    as chemotherapy drugs. As will be seen, none of these three
    types of chemotherapy drugs are specifically targeting malignant
    cells but exploit general properties of living and dividing
    cells, often causing considerable adverse side effects. Accordingly,
    much contemporary research about chemotherapy drugs is focussed
    on finding and testing substances that act more specifically
    on malignant cells and cause less damage to healthy cells.
    This research is moving in a more biologically and biochemically
    informed direction than traditional chemotherapy research
    over several past decades.</p>
<h1 id="dna-crosslinking-agents">DNA crosslinking agents</h1>
<p>Since the accidental discovery in 1965 by <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/further-reading">Rosenberg at el.</a>    that inorganic compounds such as cisplatin inhibit cell division,
    this compound has been widely used in chemotherapy. It is
    an unusual pharmaceutical in that almost all other medicinal
    drugs are organic compounds. Cisplatin is a highly potent
    (and highly generally toxic) agent against a number of malignant
    tumours.</p>
<p>Cisplatin, <i>cis</i>-(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>2</sub>,
    is usually administered intravenously in saline solution.
    Activation of the cisplatin complex occurs in the intracellular
    environment where the chlorine concentration is notably lower
    than that of the extracellular space: the chlorine ligands
    are replaced by weakly bonded water molecules, increasing
    the reactivity of the <i>cis</i>-(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pt
    fragment (see Figure 1). The increased potency of cisplatin
    in this activated form results in its reaction with various
    molecular cell targets. Though various potential reactive
    sites exist within a cell, interaction with the DNA is considered
    to be the primary target. There, the predominant interaction
    is the formation of 1,2-intrastrand cross links between adjacent
    purine bases. The activation of cisplatin, followed by binding
    of the <i>cis</i>-(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Pt fragment
    to a preferred site in a particular groove in the DNA strand
    is shown in Figure 1: the fragment fits this groove particularly
    well.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Cisplatin entering the cell, followed
        by hydrolysis and the formation of 1,2-cross links in
        the DNA strand.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such interaction induces a conformational change to the structure
    of the DNA causing it to both bend and unwind to varying
    degrees. Since DNA replication is at the heart of all cell
    replication, any hindrance of DNA and its replication will
    inhibit cell division and replication in some way.</p>
<p>Though cisplatin exposure is clearly linked to disruption in
    the replication and transcription processes of the cell,
    such effects do not necessarily and immediately result in
    cell death. Instead pro-apoptotic signals triggered in the
    cell in response to DNA damage can also activate various
    DNA repair mechanisms. DNA damage caused by cisplatin tends
    to be poorly repaired in contrast to that caused by adducts
    with less cytotoxic molecules. Effective DNA repair mechanisms
    are obviously extremely useful for the successful replication
    of healthy cells to avoid errors in DNA and cell replication
    (mutations). However, occasionally tumour cells exhibit or
    develop resistance to cisplatin. In such cases an enhanced
    nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, the mechanism responsible
    for DNA repair, has been observed alongside further resistance
    mechanisms such as reduced drug uptake or increased drug
    inactivation or increased excretion of the drug molecules
    from the cell.</p>
<p>Like most other water-soluble metabolites, cisplatin is eliminated
    from the body via the kidneys, leading to an accumulation
    of the drug in the kidneys. While other antineoplastic drugs
    causing DNA damage (see below) predominantly do harm to rapidly
    dividing cells, cisplatin causes considerable damage also
    to some more slowly dividing cells such as those in renal
    tubules by a number of different mechanisms. In fact, the
    nephrotoxicity of cisplatin is a significant treatment-limiting
    factor.</p>
<p>In some cases, carboplatin may be used instead. Carboplatin exhibits
    greater stability with regard to hydrolysis and thus tends
    to cause less renal damage because predominantly a less aggressive
    version of the drug molecule is excreted via the kidneys.
    The increased stability to hydrolysis arises as a function
    of the different leaving group in the molecule, replacing
    the chlorine ions in cisplatin by an organic molecule fragment.
    The overall cytotoxic properties of carboplatin are otherwise
    largely very similar to those of cisplatin. Figure 2 highlights
    the similarities and differences between the two platinum
    antineoplastic drugs.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The molecular structures of cisplatin,
        <i>cis</i>-(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>2</sub>        (left), <i>trans</i>-(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>2</sub>        (bottom), and carboplatin (right). In both clinically
        active molecules the Pt atom is in the centre of a square-planar
        coordination environment with the two NH<sub>3</sub>        ligands arranged in <i>cis</i> position with respect
        to each other. An alternative geometric isomer, <i>trans</i>-(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>2</sub>        (bottom) does not show similar levels of cytotoxicity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cisplatin and carboplatin are not the only substances interfering
    with DNA replication by interacting with the DNA strands
    in some way. For example, an organic compound called bleomycin
    is also used in chemotherapy and is thought to hinder DNA
    replication by binding to it. <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/further-reading">Bleomycin</a>    has been known for a long time and after its discovery was
    originally intended as an antibiotic but was found to be
    too toxic for that purpose.</p>
<h1 id="antimetabolites">Antimetabolites</h1>
<p>A group of drugs commonly known as antimetabolites also aim to
    cause damage to DNA, though in ways very different from the
    damage caused by cisplatin. Antimetabolites mainly harm rapidly
    dividing cells. They are structurally similar to normal metabolites
    yet display small but crucial chemical differences. Antimetabolites
    inhibit cellular processes by essentially taking part in
    them and competing with the normal metabolites, consequently
    inducing cell death by blocking metabolic pathways or leading
    to inviable faulty products in the cell cycle.</p>
<p>The two commonly used antimetabolites used in the treatment of
    head and neck cancers are 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate.
    The two substances are shown together with their respective
    normal metabolite counterparts in Figure 3.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The molecular structures of the
        antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (top left) and the corresponding
        metabolite uracil (top right), the antimetabolite methotrexate
        (bottom) and the corresponding metabolite folic acid
        (middle).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thymidine (T) is one of the four building blocks of DNA. 5-Fluorouracil
    and methotrexate belong to the same type of antimetabolite
    (further target metabolites exist and are being used for
    the <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/further-reading">treatment of other malignancies</a>)
    and both ultimately inhibit the thymidine biosynthesis pathways.
    Cells which are rapidly synthesising DNA, such as malignant
    cells undergoing frequent replication, will therefore experience
    a relatively more severe depletion of thymidine (and consequently
    cell death) than slowly replicating cells. A further common
    feature of these two antimetabolites is their pursuit of
    a variety of metabolic mechanisms. For example, methotrexate
    in low dosage is also used in the treatment of severe cases
    of arthritis or Crohn’s disease as one of its effects is
    immunosuppression, in addition to being cytotoxic.</p>
<h2>5-Fluorouracil</h2>
<p>As an analogue of uracil (U), a pyrimidine base utilised in RNA
    and as a precursor to thymidine synthesis, 5-fluorouracil
    (5-FU) is a potent antimetabolite. 5-FU is a prodrug (an
    inactive compound that is metabolised to produce a therapeutic
    agent) and its modes of action depend on which of the various
    metabolic pathways are followed after administration of the
    prodrug. Fundamentally all these routes result in 5-FU being
    activated to one of multiple nucleotide forms and going on
    to cause damage to DNA and/or RNA. RNA is a single-stranded
    polymeric chain, normally folded onto itself, while DNA is
    a double-stranded helix. RNA is required for genetic information
    to be read from DNA and translated in the process of cell
    division and in the production of specific proteins. A whole
    range of RNA versions with slightly different roles in these
    processes are known.</p>
<p>One course of events in which 5-FU prevents the synthesis of
    thymidine is summarised in Figure 4.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Illustration how 5-FU prevents
        the synthesis of thymidine. Top trace: the normal pathway
        from uracil <i>via</i> uridine to thymidine; bottom trace:
        the pathway from 5-FU to 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine monophosphate,
        blocking transformation to thymidine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thymidine (T) is an essential component of DNA, produced by the
    methylation of deoxyuridine. This reaction is as catalysed
    by an enzyme, thymidylate synthase. Deoxyuridine, in turn,
    is derived from uracil. This normal course of events is shown
    at the top of Figure 4. With 5-FU being a close analogue
    of uracil it is unsurprising that, once activated, 5-FU is
    able to interfere with the synthesis of thymidine. This is
    shown in the bottom trace of Figure 4. Taking part in the
    expected biosynthesis route, 5-FU is converted to the fluorine
    analogue of deoxyuridine monophosphate. At this stage it
    forms a strong covalent link with the enzyme that normally
    catalyses the next reaction step (thymidylate synthase),
    production of thymidine monophosphate. The presence of the
    fluorine atom in 5-FU in the place of a hydrogen atom in
    normal uracil results in a permanent binding with the enzyme,
    rendering the enzyme useless and thymidine synthesis is halted.
    This impairs DNA synthesis due to lack of thymidine supply
    and eventually results in so-called <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/further-reading">thymineless cell death</a>.</p>
<p>This metabolic pathway of 5-FU is shown in Figure 5, together
    with two further pathways that allow 5-FU to interfere with
    the life cycle of a cell.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> An overview of several of the
        multiple metabolic pathways of 5-FU, all leading to cell
        death. Top part: overall map; bottom part: key of abbreviations,
        note the subtle differences of molecular structures leading
        to very different effects in the cell cycle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The pathway illustrated in Figure 4 (and included in the map
    in the top part of Figure 5) is causing cell death by preventing
    the production of a necessary building block of DNA. When
    5-FU is incorporated in a different branch of the metabolism
    of a cell, it disrupts RNA synthesis (see left branch of
    map in Figure 5): metabolic conversion of 5-FU to 5-fluoro-uridine
    triphosphate (FUTP) via 5-fluorouridine (FUR) provides an
    alternative substrate for RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase
    is an enzyme that is essential in the construction of the
    polymeric RNA chains (RNA in turn is an essential element
    of all living cells; it is needed to copy and translate information
    from DNA). Consequently, FUTP is incorporated into cellular
    RNA where it is then able to adversely affect all kinds of
    metabolic processes involving RNA.</p>
<p>Similarly, when 5-FU is converted to the deoxyuridine equivalent
    (FdUTP) it can provide an alternative substrate to DNA polymerase,
    with similar disruptive effects on DNA synthesis in the cell.
    As yet another possible result of 5-FU metabolism, FdUTP
    may be incorporated into DNA to produce similar disruptive
    effects caused by the faulty DNA version (symbolised by the
    right branch in the map, Figure 5). This is a less common
    effect owing to the action of enzymes that ordinarily prevent
    uracil incorporation into DNA.</p>
<p>The general pattern remains throughout that very subtle, minor
    changes in molecular structure (see, for example, bottom
    part of Figure 5) have drastic and varied effects on the
    cell metabolism.</p>
<h2>Methotrexate</h2>
<p>Belonging to a class of antimetabolites known as antifols, methotrexate
    (MTX) is a close analogue of folic acid (see Figure 3). Folic
    acid plays a key role in thymidine synthesis. Folic acid
    and its derivatives belong to the family of B vitamins. MTX,
    by virtue of this similarity to folic acid is able to interfere
    with the folate metabolism through multiple pathways. The
    mechanism by which MTX hinders thymidine production in the
    cell is very different from that by which 5-FU interferes
    with thymidine synthesis. This may be taken as an illustration
    of the multiple metabolic cellular pathways in the cell cycle,
    offering both multiple opportunities for targeted interventions
    and chances for unwanted (and sometimes unforeseen) effects.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The main metabolic pathways of
        folic acid and methotrexate. Left: the multiple steps
        from folic acid to thymidine synthesis; right: the blocked
        pathway at the dihydrofolic acid stage when methotrexate
        is incorporated instead of folic acid.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The left part of Figure 6 illustrates the stepwise regular metabolic
    transformation of folic acid into methylene tetrahydrofolic
    acid, the compound which acts as the source of the carbon
    atom / methyl group in thymidine. Each of these steps is
    catalysed by enzymes. The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase
    (DHFR) is responsible for enabling the step from dihydrofolic
    acid to tetrahydrofolic acid.</p>
<p>Competitive inhibition of DHFR by MTX prevents the conversion
    of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid as part of the
    biosynthesis of thymidine (Figure 6, right). The affinity
    of MTX to this receptor is about a factor 10<sup>3</sup>    higher than that for the normal substrate. The depletion
    of tetrahydrofolic acid in turn creates a deficiency of methylene
    tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved in the methylation
    of deoxyuridine to thymidine. Therefore the resulting lack
    of thymidine results in a decrease in DNA synthesis and consequently
    cell replication is inhibited.</p>
<p>Folate growth factors are known to assume polyglutamate (polymeric)
    forms within the cell which are a preferred substrate of
    DHFR. MTX also has the potential to be converted into polyglutamate
    derivatives with a higher affinity for DHFR in comparison
    to MTX itself. The MTX polyglutamate is able to accumulate
    within the cell and achieves a more prolonged suppression
    of DHFR. The higher affinity of MTX polyglutamate and its
    longer intracellular half-life makes this mode of action
    more effective.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the inhibition of DHFR oxidised folates are
    produced and accumulate in the cell. These oxidised folates
    have been shown to have potential to inhibit a variety of
    enzymes associated with purine synthesis, another important
    metabolic pathway especially for the synthesis of adenine
    and guanine (two further of the four basic building blocks
    of DNA). Such enzymes may also be inhibited by the MTX polyglutamate
    forms.</p>
<p>Only a small quantity of the DHFR enzyme is required to maintain
    normal metabolic activity in the cell. The regulation of
    the cell metabolism responds to lower concentrations of tetrahydrofolic
    acid (see left part of Figure 6) by producing more DHFR.
    Accordingly, higher DHFR concentrations in the cell can counteract
    MTX and are the underlying cause for the development of MTX
    resistance.</p>
<h1 id="protein-inhibitors">Protein inhibitors</h1>
<p>The mode of action of the two types of antineoplatic drugs discussed
    so far is best summarised as cytotoxic, that is killing cells
    by interfering with basic building blocks and reactions in
    the cell metabolism. The mode of action of so-called protein
    inhibitors is better called cytostatic, that is inhibiting
    cell growth. Because of this difference in mode of action
    there were early hopes that such drugs would have less severe
    side effects than conventional chemotherapy drugs. That turns
    out to be not the case.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> An illustration of the competitive
        action of cetuximab with epidermal growth factor (EGF)
        in blocking the receptor (EGFR). Left: the regular cascade
        of events in cell signalling and growth. Right: cetuximab
        blocking EGFR and thus cell signalling and growth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 7 illustrates the working principle of one such protein
    inhibitor, cetuximab. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its
    complimentary receptor (EGFR) ordinarily orchestrate the
    growth of cells. The binding of EGF to its receptor results
    in the affected cell being permitted to multiply which, in
    a healthy mature system, is only rarely required. Mutations
    leading to upregulation of these proteins culminate in the
    proliferation of malignant cells by bypassing this strict
    growth control mechanism. The ability of malignant cells
    to produce their own EGF allows continuous and rapid growth.</p>
<p>Through competition with endogenous ligands that bind to the
    EGFR, cetuximab acts to inhibit the stimulation of this receptor
    by blocking it. In this way cetuximab prevents phosphorylation
    of the enzyme tyrosine kinase associated with EGFR, resulting
    in no further cell signalling and no further cell growth.</p>
<p>Obviously, only tumour lines expressing particular growth factors
    / receptors will be susceptible to this kind of ‘biological’
    therapy (a well known case from public dispute about NHS
    support is the treatment of some breast cancers with trastuzumab).
    Cetuximab belongs to a class of biological macromolecules
    (very large molecules) called monoclonal antibodies. These
    are so large that they cannot easily (or not at all) transgress
    the cell membrane and are thus limited to acting on receptors
    and structures on the cell surface, such as EGFR.</p>
<p>Another mechanism to hinder the process of cell division and
    growth is to interfere with the late stage of cell division
    and the assembly of daughter cells.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/chemotherapy/principles/detailed/figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Prevention of the depolymerisation
        of tubulin by taxanes, hindering successful assembly
        of daughter cells.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 8 illustrates the working principles of the late stages
    of cell division (mitosis) and how taxanes interfere with
    this process. Mitosis (the late stage of cell division) requires
    mitotic spindles to form to provide structure and to separate
    genetic material between the two resulting daughter cells
    in an orderly and controlled fashion. Polymerisation of smaller
    components (tubulin) allow these spindles to form (Figure
    8 top) and to retract in the next stage of separation into
    two daughter cells, with the relevant genetic material attached,
    by depolymerisation (Figure 8 middle). Both of these steps
    are essential for successful cell replication and thus offer
    another target for antineoplastic therapies.</p>
<p>Taxanes are specifically concerned with the depolymerisation
    process (Figure 8 bottom). By stabilising the polymeric microtubules,
    taxanes prevent the mitotic spindles from retracting. This
    restriction prevents the continuation of mitosis and consequently
    the successful formation of daughter cells.</p>
