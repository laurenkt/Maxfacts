<p>Trying to sketch the basic working principles of radiotherapy
    is a multi-faceted task that is not really possible to achieve
    by simply reducing it to an isolated view of the physics
    of beams of particles or photons. A great deal is known about
    these basic physical principles but here we need to also
    make connections to the ways in which radiation interacts
    with matter, in particular the effects of high-energy radiation
    on living matter. An enormous body of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/further-reading">scientific literature</a>    about this topic exists and basic research as well as clinical
    trials are underway in many places and laboratories.</p>
<p>Our brief discussion takes a look at the energy range over which
    photon radiation occurs and puts high-energy radiation into
    context with the energetics of molecules in cells. The different
    ways in which high-energy radiation causes profound biological
    damage are outlined, depending on the type of radiation used
    (photons or particles). Strategies to make photon irradiation
    regimens more selective and less damaging to healthy tissue
    are briefly mentioned.</p>
<h1 id="the-range-of-electromagnetic-radiation-and-its-high-energy-region">The range of electromagnetic radiation and its high-energy region</h1>
<p>Radiation by photons covers an extremely large range of frequencies
    and, accordingly, energies. This is summarized in Figure
    1.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-radiotherapy-phys-principle-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The spectrum of electromagnetic
        radiation with frequencies / energies increasing from
        left to right.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This overview of the range of photon radiation with the approximate
    frequencies / energy ranges associated with the different
    regions is known as the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.
    Roughly the region of UV (ultraviolet) radiation marks the
    energy that is high enough to damage the organic molecules
    that make up living cells and bodies. Chemical bonds holding
    together such molecules have typical strengths (measured
    in kJ/mol) for different types of bonds, about 400-500 kJ/mol
    for a standard covalent bond in standard organic molecules.
    Most of the organic molecules that make up the cells in our
    bodies belong to the type of standard organic molecules.</p>
<p>In order to damage and break a chemical bond in a molecule by
    radiation the energy of the radiation has to be at least
    of the same order as the strength of the chemical bond. All
    the types of radiation to the left of the UV region in Figure
    1 don’t carry enough energy to be able to damage or break
    chemical bonds in typical molecules. The energy of ultrasound
    or radio waves is many orders of magnitude less than the
    strength of any chemical bond and thus <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> scans are not harmful.</p>
<p>UV radiation is the borderline energy region. The higher-energy
    end of the UV region of radiation undoubtedly does damage
    to living cells (think of damage to skin by sunburn and the
    occurrence of skin cancers due to unprotected and extended
    exposure to intense sun light, or tanning studios) and it
    makes good sense to protect skin and eyes from these effects.
    The lower-energy end of the UV region can still be harmful
    as accumulated effects occur over time. For example, repeated
    sunburns or the ageing effects of tanning on skin (wrinkles
    caused by accumulated damage to collagen molecules in the
    tissue underneath skin) fall into this category; plant leaves
    that usually work in photosynthesis can suffer sunburn effects
    similar to sunburn of the skin of humans. The effects of
    (UV) irradiation can accumulate over time with the overall
    damaging effects being dependent on the dosage, that is on
    overall energy delivered over time.</p>
<p>To the right of the UV region in Figure 1 are X-ray and gamma
    ray photons, with gamma rays typically being the product
    of a range of different radioactive decay mechanisms. The
    energies of X-rays and gamma rays greatly exceed the strength
    of typical chemical bonds. Thus photon radiation over the
    entire X-ray and gamma ray energy region lends itself to
    be used as a destructive force, for example when trying to
    destroy malignant cells but invariably will also damage healthy
    tissues. Calling the higher-energy region gamma-rays and
    the lower-energy region X-rays in this range is largely for
    historical reasons (when in the past only limited technologies
    existed to produce high-energy photons and only radioactive
    decay existed as a source of very high-energy photons).</p>
<p>Gamma rays occur naturally in our environment as the product
    of radioactive decay of certain elements and/or isotopes
    of elements, or can be generated in accelerators. The enormous
    energies released in the process of radioactive decay demand
    extensive measures of safety and protection to be put in
    place to avoid catastrophic effects from accidental exposure
    (think of nuclear power plants). Elsewhere in the universe
    high-energy processes are ongoing that produce photon radiation
    in the entire X-ray region of the spectrum (for example,
    cosmic rays originating from the explosion of supernovae).
    In our natural environment on earth - luckily - no such processes
    occur naturally and photons in the X-ray range of energy
    have to be generated artificially. Creating X-rays basically
    requires a vacuum tube, fitted with a heated cathode from
    which electrons escape. A high voltage applied across the
    vacuum tube accelerates these electrons. The anode in an
    X-ray tube is a metal plate. When the accelerated electrons
    hit this metal target, high-energy photons are released –
    the X-rays. This process can be tuned to produce X-rays over
    a fair range of energies (and in fairly straightforward ways
    in modern linear accelerators). For example, X-ray radiation
    for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">diagnostic purposes</a>    uses the lowest possible energy and dose of irradiation in
    order to keep potential harm at a minimum.</p>
<h1 id="biological-damage-caused-by-high-energy-photon-radiation">Biological damage caused by high-energy photon radiation</h1>
<p>High-energy radiation mostly harms cells by damaging the DNA
    molecules in some way. This does not necessarily mean immediate
    apoptosis (cell death) but functioning DNA is central to
    successful cell replication and tissue growth. Unrepaired
    damage to DNA hinders cell replication and eventually prevents
    further cell growth. Having said that the harmful potential
    of high-energy photons relies on their energy greatly exceeding
    that of typical chemical bonds in organic molecules (these
    chemical bonds are made up by pairs of tightly connected
    electrons), one might be tempted to assume that the direct
    process shown in Figure 2 is the main mechanism to damage
    DNA molecules: a direct effect, simply breaking chemical
    bonds in the DNA strands.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/radiotherapy/physical-principles/detailed/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Direct damage to DNA molecules
        caused by high-energy radiation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This effect does occur but is not the most potent mechanism by
    which high-energy photons harm DNA in cells. The main damage
    caused by high-energy photons is due to more indirect mechanisms.
    This is illustrated in Figure 3.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/radiotherapy/physical-principles/detailed/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Mechanism of creating radicals
        by interaction of high-energy photons with abundant small
        molecules in the cell (O2, oxygen and H2O, water), leading
        to a cascade of production of further radicals.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, molecules are
    basic components in all living cells, water molecules are
    ubiquitous. Both these small molecules have exposed pairs
    of electrons that are particularly prone to interact with
    high-energy photons. High-energy photons simply knock out
    an electron, creating a so called free radical in the process
    (a radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron). Radicals
    are highly reactive chemical species, especially those created
    from O<sub>2</sub> molecules, mostly OH• radicals. It is
    these radicals that cause and mediate damage to the DNA in
    the cell as well as preventing cellular repair mechanisms.
    In addition, each radical starts a chain of events of creating
    further radicals, propagating and multiplying the harmful
    mechanism beyond the actual duration of irradiation. The
    different types of indirect damage to DNA are illustrated
    in Figure 4.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/radiotherapy/physical-principles/detailed/figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Different types of DNA damage
        caused by high-energy radiation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Damage could affect only one of the two strands of a DNA molecule
    (Figure 4, left), it could cause a double-strand break (Figure
    4, middle) or could induce more subtle chemical modifications,
    so-called base mutations (Figure 4, right). The latter leads
    to a faulty copy of DNA that will not work properly anymore
    and will eventually prevent the cell from replicating. Base
    mutations are thought to be difficult to repair for the cell.
    It is further thought that double-stranded breaks of DNA
    are harder to repair for the cell and cause even more severe
    damage than single-stranded breaks (most of the DNA damage
    caused by high-energy photons are single-stranded breaks).
    There are many clever repair mechanisms in place in all living
    cells, including malignant cells, to fight damage to DNA
    to protect the life cycle. Malignant cells have such defenses
    in place in differing degrees of effectiveness, depending
    on the tumor cell line. Some such cell lines have particularly
    good defense strategies and hence are generally fairly resistant
    to radiotherapies (for example, melanoma cells or nerve cell
    tumours), some other cell lines actually learn how to react
    to radiation-induced DNA damage and become less vulnerable
    to radiation over the course of treatment (similar to defense
    mechanisms in place to protect cells against damage caused
    by various <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy agents</a>    and also leading to resistance).</p>
<p>It is tempting to think that the mechanism by which irradiation
    with high-energy photons damages DNA is not so important,
    as long as malignant cells are being damaged. The underlying
    mechanism, however, is the reason why in some cases radiotherapy
    does not work as effectively as one would wish, or may require
    longer and more intense irradiation regimens than one would
    wish. With most of the cell damage from photon irradiation
    relying on an indirect mechanism involving various species
    of oxygen radicals at different stages, some metabolic peculiarities
    of malignant cells play an important role. Many tumour cells
    are depleted of oxygen. This could be for the simple reason
    that the orderly building of cellular energy-supply mechanisms
    (normally depending heavily on oxygen molecules from regular
    blood supply) cannot keep pace with the rapid growth of malignant
    cells, but further, more complicated biochemical and physiological
    reasons may be equally responsible. Good levels of oxygenation
    in cells are closely correlated with success of irradiation
    schemes. Oxygen is an effective so called radio-sensitizer
    (see below) which is thought to be mainly involved in preventing
    repair of DNA damage caused by high-energy radiation.</p>
<p>Low levels of oxygen in tumour cells is called tumour hypoxia.
    Oxygen-depleted tumour cells instead tend to switch to high
    rates of glucose (sugar) uptake to make increased glycolysis
    their path to sustain their energy demands (this increased
    rate of glucose uptake is exploited in <a href="/diagnosis/tests/pet-scans">PET scans</a>    to identify and locate malignant growth in the body) as one
    of their many survival strategies. Hypoxic cells respond
    less sensitively to high-energy photon irradiation. Some
    of many <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/further-reading">past and current research activities</a>    therefore look into possibilities to increase the oxygen
    levels in hypoxic cells, or to create similar sensitizing
    effects in some other ways. For example, <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">hyperbaric oxygen</a>    has been suggested (and tried). Use of other synthetic radio-sensitizers
    such as NO• gas has been explored, and some of the <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles/more-info">common chemotherapy agents</a>    seem to have enhancing effects on irradiation schemes (as
    well as on unwanted side-effects), presumably by hindering
    DNA repair. Many other biochemically inspired choices of
    compounds have been, and continue to be, explored for their
    potential to act as radio-sensitizers. Other ideas involve
    the switching off of regulatory proteins in cells that mediate
    and manage the cells’ response to hypoxia by using inhibitors
    for such protein actions (HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor)
    inhibitors) and in this way preventing increased uptake of
    glucose instead of oxygen. The general aim of all such research
    activities is to selectively enhance the sensitivity of malignant
    cells to the effects of high-energy radiation. Convincing
    evidence of the overall beneficial effects of many such strategies
    <em>in vivo</em> from high-quality trials is yet to be seen.</p>
<h1 id="generating-high-energy-radiation-with-different-particles">Generating high-energy radiation with different particles</h1>
<p>So far we have only considered high-energy radiation delivered
    by photons. Photons may be seen as little packages of light
    waves carrying energy depending on the frequency of the light
    wave: the higher the frequency of the wave, the higher its
    energy. Only a very small section in the frequency range
    of electromagnetic radiation is the area of light waves that
    are visible for us (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>High-energy radiation can alternatively be delivered by beams
    of small particles if these are travelling sufficiently fast,
    at a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Creation
    of particle beams suitable for therapeutic irradiation thus
    requires local access to cyclotron or linear accelerator
    technologies. In principle, many different small particles
    and ions could be delivery vehicles for irradiation. Of these
    only a few types of particles are practically useful: electrons,
    neutrons and protons. The general motivation to explore alternative
    sources of radiation stems from the need for more specific
    irradiation schemes, and/or the need for different mechanisms
    to cause damage to cells from the indirect effects of photon
    irradiation.</p>
<h2>Electrons</h2>
<p>High-energy radiation is by far most commonly delivery by photons,
    produced in small linear accelerators optimized for delivery
    of photons in the X-ray region for purposes of radiotherapy.
    X-ray photons are created by accelerated electrons hitting
    a metal target which then releases the high-energy photons.
    Many clinical linear accelerators are constructed in such
    a way that the last step in the process can be omitted and
    the accelerated electrons can be collimated and used as delivery
    vehicles for irradiation, instead of producing photons.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/further-reading">Electron irradiation schemes</a>    are the second most common schemes. Particle irradiation
    tends to cause more direct damage to cell structures than
    does irradiation by photons, potentially causing more severe
    damage to malignant (and healthy) cells. Beams of accelerated
    electrons only reach body regions near the surface and thus
    are only suitable for irradiation of tumours on or very near
    to the body surface, traditionally superficial skin cancers.
    This is in part due to the fact that electrons undergo multiple
    scattering events while travelling along and thus get delineated
    from a straight trajectory as well as loosing energy rapidly
    while travelling through matter (Bragg peak, see below and
    Figure 5). This limited penetration depth may be viewed as
    a blessing or a curse: limited penetration depth means less
    damage to healthy tissues deeper in the body but electrons
    cannot reach target regions deeper in the body.</p>
<p>Electrons carry a negative charge and thus have many different
    ways to interact with matter / body tissues. Carrying charge
    is the main reason for their multiple scattering events when
    travelling in matter. Body matter is quite irregularly structured
    and made of many different components, and bodies overall
    have irregular shapes. This presents the main challenge to
    deliver precise electron irradiation schemes, even if mainly
    aimed at superficial body regions: the multiple interaction
    mechanisms of accelerated electrons with matter, combined
    with the different irregularities of body shape and structure
    make it challenging to model and pre-calculate precise irradiation
    schemes for electron irradiation.</p>
<h2>Neutrons</h2>
<p>The neutron is another particle that can be accelerated (though
    a major reactor and accelerator facility is required; accelerated
    neutrons are usually derived from beams of accelerated protons)
    to speeds that make it suitable for therapeutic high-energy
    irradiation. As the name implies, neutrons carry some mass
    but do not carry charge and thus do not suffer the same kind
    of multiple, charge-related different scattering events as
    electrons. However, fast neutrons are not widely available,
    only a few centres worldwide are equipped to deliver suitable
    neutron beams. The practical requirements to house such a
    facility (essentially a vault accommodating the equipment
    and irradiation sessions, acting as a radiation shield to
    the environment) are also demanding.</p>
<p>It is thought that once hitting their target, neutrons cause
    severe destruction to cells by directly damaging DNA (lethal
    double-strand breaks and other direct structural damage,
    see Figures 2 and 4). In principle, this makes neutron (and
    other particle) irradiation schemes promising approaches
    to cause more damage to hypoxic malignant cells than photon
    irradiation can achieve. While this may be a wanted effect
    as far as malignant cells are concerned, the undesired effects
    on healthy tissue are more severe as well. <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/further-reading">Neutron irradiation</a>    is not likely to become a widely used irradiation scheme
    any time soon, given the enormous logistical difficulties
    and cost involved and especially as there do not seem to
    be overall therapeutic advantages over modern photon irradiation
    schemes. In addition the unwanted effects of so-called fast
    neutron therapy were so devastating in the initial clinical
    trials that they were abandoned.</p>
<h2>Protons</h2>
<p>Yet another particle with properties suitable as a delivery vehicle
    for high-energy irradiation is the proton, the nucleus of
    a hydrogen atom carrying some mass and a positive charge.
    Like irradiation with other particles it is expected that
    irradiation with proton beams causes more direct damage to
    DNA and cells than photon irradiation, mostly causing more
    double-strand breaks.</p>
<p>Protons can be accelerated to particular speeds / particular
    energies. A particular energy corresponds to a specific penetration
    depth in matter / in the body where their highest dose of
    radiation will be deposited. This is different from the way
    how, and where, the highest dose of photon radiation is deposited.
    The two mechanisms are compared in Figure 5.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/radiotherapy/physical-principles/detailed/figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Different trajectories of photons
        (blue) and protons (red) through matter; the plot shows
        energy as a function of penetration depth of radiation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The deposition of radiation of photons essentially decays exponentially
    with increasing penetration depth, exposing tissues between
    body surface and target area to high doses of radiation.
    The deposition characteristics of protons are quite different:
    as accelerated protons travel through matter, they lose only
    little energy and by far the largest proportion of radiation
    dose is deposited in a small area defined by their initial
    speed / energy (and the material through which they travel).
    This spot is called a Bragg peak (after its discoverer W.
    Bragg). Beyond this pre-determined penetration depth there
    is a sharp drop of energy and hardly any further radiation
    to tissue within a range of millimeters, in contrast to photons
    which continue to deliver radiation to tissue beyond the
    target area.</p>
<p>Protons have mass and a positive charge and, therefore, can be
    accelerated precisely. Strong external magnets then focus
    the protons into beams of a few millimeters and multiple
    beams (‘pencil beam’) are directed by the magnetic fields.
    Multiple combined and superimposed such beams (several thousand)
    in principle can then accurately and evenly deliver the required
    radiation dose to any shape of tumour. Radiation delivery
    requires reverse planning: first the area and volume in need
    of irradiation is defined and located (usually by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    and/or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a> scans)
    and then the best possible irradiation scheme is derived.
    This is not a straightforward process as planning needs to
    include a multitude of parameters and interdependencies of
    parameters – bodies are irregularly shaped and are made up
    of heterogeneous structures. Typically, suitable irradiation
    schemes are worked out by numerical optimization and repeated
    checks are carried out throughout the treatment scheme.</p>
<p>Proton radiation therapies are considerably more expensive than
    photon radiation schemes and can only be offered in specialised
    centres with technology to accelerate and focus proton beams.
    In the UK, proton radiation is offered very selectively.
    So far, only relatively low-energy protons are regularly
    used for the treatment of eye tumours in one centre. However,
    two new proton irradiation facilities are scheduled to be
    opened in 2018. It is likely that these facilities will be
    mainly used for the treatment of some paediatric cancers
    as well as for some specific types of tumours in adults:
    hard-to-reach tumours (such as at the base of the skull)
    and tumours in the vicinity of vital structures preventing
    conventional photon radiotherapy. From currently available
    data it is not possible to conclude robustly if there are
    any significantly improved outcomes from proton irradiation,
    other than reduced damage to healthy tissue.</p>
<h1 id="selective-photon-irradiation-schemes">Selective photon irradiation schemes</h1>
<p>High-energy radiation causes severe damage to healthy and malignant
    cells alike; so any beneficial applications of radiation
    therapies will have to maximize radiation delivery to target
    volumes while minimizing exposure of nearby healthy tissues.
    Accordingly, the development and implementation of selective
    photon irradiation delivery schemes is a big theme in past
    and present research and in the application of radiotherapies.</p>
<p>One long established way to deliver relatively localised high-energy
    photon irradiation is to implant radioactive material directly
    into or very near to a tumour (brachytherapy), usually iridium
    wires. This technique employs the <sup>192</sup>Ir isotope
    which is the most stable of several radioactive iridium isotopes
    (half-life of ca. two months) and emits both beta particles
    and gamma-ray photons. The exact irradiation energy delivered
    by radioactive elements is specific to a given isotope.</p>
<p>Given the trajectories of radiation delivery of photons (see
    Figure 5) it is obvious that any schemes that permit a more
    selective delivery of photon radiation to target areas, sparing
    healthy tissue as much as possible, is highly desirable.
    For photon irradiation schemes in the head and neck region
    there are mainly three areas that should be exposed to as
    little high-energy irradiation as possible: i) the mandible,
    ii) the salivary glands, iii) generally, soft tissue in the
    region. Bone is dense material of the kind that readily absorbs
    high-energy photons (and neutrons in particular). The mandible
    consists of particularly dense bone and is thus particularly
    vulnerable to suffer radiation damage such as osteoradionecrosis,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">ORN</a>. Exposure
    of the salivary glands to high doses of high-energy radiation
    can temporarily or even permanently seriously damage the
    salivary glands, leading to severe cases of dry mouth,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>. High-energy radiation injury of soft tissues
        triggers physiological repair mechanisms with excessive
        fibrosis, similar to excessive scar tissue formation
        from burn wounds, leading to sometimes severely restricted
        mouth opening, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>.
        These are serious and lasting side-effects of non-selective
        high-energy photon irradiation in the head and neck region.</p>
<p>So called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) schemes
    have become routinely available for photon irradiation in
    most places over the past 10 years. Similar in spirit to
    the shape-selective delivery of superimposed multiple proton
    beams (see above), IMRT aims to deliver photon radiation
    that mimics and traces the shape of a tumour as closely as
    possible while exposing nearby healthy tissue to lesser radiation
    doses. The way one can handle and manipulate proton beams
    is different from the ways photon beams can be manipulated.
    In order to subdivide the photon beam into multiple smaller
    beams that then can be combined to achieve volume-selective
    irradiation, the photon beam is collimated by blocking sections
    from the beam (by small lead plates). Regimens to combine
    many different such arrangements into a series of differently
    modulated photon beams then produces an overall irradiation
    scheme that can be tailored to mainly hit a predefined shape
    and volume of a tumour. Similarly to the challenges in proton
    irradiation schemes, also in IMRT the main challenge remains
    in the simulation, planning and implementation of sufficiently
    selective schemes.</p>
<p>More recent research shows that different fractions and timing
    of irradiation schemes, as well as different energy levels
    of radiation all have different effects on different cells
    and DNA. There will definitely not be any simple solutions
    along the lines of ‘the harder the beam, the better the result’.
    There is need for much more research in this area where biology
    and physics meet in order to understand many of these effects
    in more profound ways. At least for the time being the modelling
    of selective irradiation schemes in real living bodies remains
    a hard challenge, more difficult than the actual technical
    irradiation delivery.</p>
