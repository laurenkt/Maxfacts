<h2>Teletherapy (external beam radiotherapy)</h2>
<p>This is the most widely used method. The machines used are linear
    accelerators (LINACS) that use microwave technologies to
    accelerate electrons such that after their collision with
    a heavy metal target a high-energy X-ray (1-25MeV) photon
    beam is produced. This photon beam is precise in definition,
    direction and depth allowing careful planning in terms of
    delivery. Delivery planning is almost always aided by
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a>. This is schematically illustrated in Figure
        1.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Schematic illustration of information
        obtained before start of radiotherapy, precise location

        to be protected from radiation as far as possible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The precise location of the tumour and nearby healthy structures
    that need to be protected from radiation as far as possible
    are determined before delivery starts.</p>
<p>For each session the patient is immobilized in a clear custom
    made plastic shell which must fit accurately over the face
    in order to ensure consistent and reproducible delivery in
    each session (see Figure 2). The need for the mask to fit
    can create significant delays if radiotherapy is postoperative
    and full resolution of postoperative swelling has not occurred,
    or even worse there is <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">flap failure</a>    delaying the optimum window of treatment (ideally starting
    around 6 weeks postoperatively) or creating further anatomical
    changes.</p>

        fitting face mask ahead of radiotherapy session.</figcaption>

<p>Multiple beams are used to maximize delivery to the tumour target
    volume yet minimizing the effect on adjacent healthy tissue
    such as salivary glands, spinal cord and lens of the eye.
    The accuracy of this process is improved by CT planning and
    sophisticated irradiation schemes such as intensity modulation
    (IMRT, see below).</p>
<p>There are several regimens with variable dosage and fractions
    (a fraction is a single dose delivered) used. The optimum
    treatment time and number of doses remains controversial
    and dependent on the volume irradiated. A common regimen
    for head and neck cancer is around a total dose of 65 Grays
    (a Gray is energy absorption of 1 Joule/kg) delivered as
    multiple fractions over 35 days. The optimal treatment of
    radiotherapy is balanced between achieving control of disease
    and too much irradiation causing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrosis</a>    or significant late effects.</p>
<p>The therapeutic effect of radiotherapy can be reduced by delays
    between fractions (allows tumour cells to repair and repopulate),
    the patient continuing to smoke and where radiotherapy is
    delivered after surgery (adjuvant radiotherapy, see below),
    relative hypoxia (insufficient oxygen levels in tissue) and
    a long delay between surgery and start of radiotherapy.</p>
<h2>Brachytherapy (interstitial radiotherapy)</h2>
<p>The principle of this method is to deliver ionizing radiation
    by inserting radioactive source(s), usually removable iridium-192
    implant wires, into the tumour using slotted guide needles
    or plastic tubing. This method will deliver a high intensity
    of radiation into its immediate vicinity with a rapid fall
    in dosage in the surrounding tissue (radioactive isotopes
    such as iridium-192 radiate monochromatic high-energy photons
    (gamma rays) due to their radioactive decay). The number
    of needles inserted will be calculated according to irradiation
    volume and dosage required. The needles are inserted manually
    or using a remote computerized loading system (to avoid staff
    irradiation) under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>    with radiological checks. As the patient is radioactive,
    he or she will be kept in a protected and isolated environment
    for the duration of the treatment. A common regimen will
    involve delivery of a total dose of around 65-70 Grays over
    6-7 days.</p>
<p>This technique is not suitable for patients with poor compliance
    or claustrophobia. Tumours very close to or involving bone
    are also unsuitable for treatment using this approach. It
    is mainly used for small tumours with the key advantage of
    good functional outcome. It is an effective treatment modality
    but does not address the neck. The post treatment area is
    often <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrotic</a> and
    very painful. This creates real difficulty in the first few
    months of distinguishing between persisting disease and radionecrosis.</p>
<h2><a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy</a></h2>
<p>The rational for postoperative (adjuvant) radiotherapy is that
    a small volume (microscopic) of malignant cells may be left
    within the surgical bed through spillage or incomplete excision
    in the margins. Where frank tumour is present, it is less
    effective and in such instances, further resection is advocated.
    However, this may not always be possible (due to proximity
    of vital structures, patient unable or unwilling to have
    further surgery or <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">flap reconstruction</a>    in situ). It has been shown that irradiating the operated
    tumour bed or neck will help reduce the chances of recurrence
    by some 50%. Ideally this is carried out within six weeks
    of surgery.</p>
<p>Neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is treatment given
    to reduce the bulk of a tumour before the definitive treatment.
    In its original sense it was given to shrink a tumour to
    make it possible to resect surgically. As the margins of
    normal tissue required for surgical excision with curative
    intent remain the same, the principal role in head and neck
    cancer is to assess the response of the tumour. An example
    would be giving <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    initially and following this with radical chemoradiotherapy
    if there was a good initial response to the chemotherapy,
    or even initial palliative doses of radiotherapy but increasing
    to a radical dose with curative intent if the response was
    promising. In these cases surgery is regarded as “salvage”
    in the event of recurrence of, or persisting, disease.</p>
<h2>Side effects of radiotherapy</h2>
<p>Unlike surgery where a lot of the side-effects are manifested
    quickly, radiotherapy’s side effects build up gradually.
    These can be divided into general, acute and delayed effects
    (see Table 1 for a summary).</p>

<h2>Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT)</h2>
<p>Radiation delivery has evolved from conventional external beam
    irradiation with a two-dimensional delivery model to three-dimensional
    conformal radiotherapy aiming for a more selective radiation
    scheme. In a further advance, Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy
    (IMRT) has been a significant technological advance since
    it allows sparing of healthy tissue while delivering radical
    radiation doses to the target volumes. IMRT works by subdividing
    the delivered radiation into multiple beams by using multiple
    collimators. In this way the radiation intensity can be finely
    modulated over the entire irradiated area, with differently
    intense radiation delivered to different areas.</p>
<p>The potential of IMRT for sparing organs at risk has been demonstrated
    in patients with mixed (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal)
    head and neck cancers. The multi-centre study <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/further-reading">PARSPORT</a>    that compared parotid sparing IMRT with standard radiotherapy
    in patients with oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer
    showed a significant reduction in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>    in the IMRT group at one year post-radiotherapy. IMRT has
    not yet been shown to significantly improve tumour control
    or patient survival compared with standard radiotherapy (two-
    or three-dimensional irradiation modes). The only randomised
    controlled trial comparing IMRT versus 3DRT reported to date,
    PARSPORT, had too small a sample size and too short a follow-up
    period to investigate any differences in clinical outcome.
    IMRT also has disadvantages resulting from the complexity
    of IMRT planning and delivery process, and the possibility
    of errors in planning or delivery.</p>
<h2><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/further-reading">Other high-energy particle beams</a></h2>
<p>Even if by far the most widely used, photons are not the only
    option that can be used for <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles">high-energy irradiation</a>.
    Other principally suitable particles include electrons, neutrons
    and protons.</p>
<p>Other radiotherapy beams used include electrons for irradiation
    of superficial tumours. The penetration depth of electrons
    (6-20MeV) in tissue (like in any other matter) is limited
    to a few cm. Beyond this depth the energy of the electrons
    very rapidly drops off due to multiple scattering events,
    thus causing less collateral damage but rendering it ineffective
    for the irradiation of tumours further away from the body
    surface). Linear accelerators used for photon-based radiotherapy
    are often suitable, with very minor modification of the set
    up, to deliver an electron beam instead of a photon beam.
    It is challenging to model and predict exactly the required
    electron irradiation scheme because of the heterogeneous
    nature and irregular shape of a human body.</p>
<p>Beams of accelerated neutrons went through a vogue but were seen
    to create much more morbidity for no greater benefit than
    photons. This may be related to the fact that high-energy
    neutrons cause direct damage to DNA in cells (different from
    the more indirect damage mechanism with photon irradiation).
    In principle this causes more severe and irreparable damage
    to tumour cells but at the same time also cause more severe
    (DNA) damage in healthy tissue.</p>
<p>Proton beam therapy is another modality. It is relatively new
    and setting up the equipment is very expensive. The proton
    beam has less scatter than conventional photon-based radiotherapy,
    due to the larger size of the particle. It is felt to be
    particularly effective for difficult to access tumours (skull
    base and paediatric cancers): protons can be accelerated
    to particular velocities, representing particular energies.
    This determines exactly how far they will travel in the body
    and where they will deposit their energy, tissue beyond this
    target area is only minimally affected. The use of proton
    beam therapy is restricted to highly specified cases in the
    UK. However, the technique is widely, some would say inappropriately,
    used in the US and parts of Europe. Maslow’s analogy of the
    hammer and the nail should always be borne in mind.</p>
<h2>Chemoradiotherapy</h2>
<p>Chemoradiotherapy involves cycles of up to 3 bouts of <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    (often quite old fashioned platinum-based drugs in conjunction
    with conventionally fractionated high intensity (radical)
    radiotherapy.</p>
<p>There is real controversy about the suitability of these regimens
    as the unwanted effects include mortality at a greater rate
    than surgery (up to 3%), greater incidence of radiation mucositis,
    severe fibrosis leading to crippling <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a> and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">radionecrosis</a>.
    The improvement in survival claimed (8-15%) may simply have
    been a manifestation of the presence of the then unknown
    HPV driven head and neck cancers which are now recognised
    as being far easier to cure. The data is being revisited.</p>
