<p>Propantheline belongs to a large group of medicinal drugs, it
    is an anticholinergic agent. This group of medications reduces
    or modifies some of the actions of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
    is a neurotransmitter (a signalling chemical that is released
    in the synapses between nerve ends and muscles) that is involved
    in a very larger number of both voluntary and involuntary
    body functions. Figure 1 compares the molecular structures
    of propantheline and acetylcholine.</p>

<p>Amongst its many effects on the parasympathetic nervous system
    (part of the autonomic nervous system), acetylcholine enhances
    the secretion from tear, sweat and salivary glands. Propantheline
    hinders this action by binding to the receptor that would
    normally bind acetylcholine (the antimuscarinic receptor)
    in these glands, but it also has a direct relaxing effect
    on smooth muscles (for example, in the digestive tract).</p>
<p>In maxillofacial surgery, propantheline is prescribed to reduce
    saliva production (another agent, hyoscine, can be used for
    the same purpose). Interestingly, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/botulinum">botulinum toxin</a>    (‘botox’) acts not by blocking an acetylcholine receptor
    but by suppressing the release of acetylcholine. Generally,
    propantheline is mostly prescribed to reduce excessive sweating
    (with the obvious adverse effect of causing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia/detailed">dry mouth (xerostomia)</a>    problems in those circumstances).</p>
<p>In common with many other anticholinergic drugs, and probably
    not surprising given the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter
    in so many different body functions, propantheline has a
    number of adverse effects. Nature also exploits the multiple
    roles of acetylcholine: many plant- and animal-derived toxins
    block, hinder or mimic the various actions of acetylcholine
    in metabolism.</p>
