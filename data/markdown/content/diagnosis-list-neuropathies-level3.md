<p>Below we give an overview of properties and functions of
    the nerves in the head and neck region, together with a
    brief summary of consequences and dysfunction following
    damage to these nerves, and the most common causes of
    damage. We conclude this section with a summary of the
    most common maxillofacial neuropathies.</p>
<h1 id="the-nerves-in-the-head-and-neck-region">The nerves in the head and neck region</h1>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more detail about the anatomy
        of the nerves in the head and neck region, this
        information is in our section about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck
            anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The human body has 12 pairs of cranial (skull) nerves,
    originating from the brain and upper spinal cord. In
    addition, there are 8 pairs of cervical (neck) spinal
    nerves, originating from the cervical part of the spinal
    cord.</p>
<p>Given the role of the brain as the control centre of the
    body, it is not surprising that the head and neck region
    is particularly rich in nerves, nerve bundles and groups
    of nerves that are involved in the regulation and
    delivery of a large proportion of body functions, as
    diverse as sense of taste, heart rate, digestive system,
    or shoulder movement. The cranial nerves can be broadly
    subdivided into sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a
    combination of both modalities.</p>
<p>The brain as the body-control centre requires two-way
    traffic of information. Some cranial nerves deliver
    information from the body to the brain; this afferent
    (incoming) mode is delivered by sensory nerves,
    reporting from skin and internal organs, as well as
    about sight, sound, balance and taste. Other cranial
    nerves deliver instructions from the brain to the body;
    this efferent (outgoing) mode is carried out by motor
    nerves and activates skeletal muscles, autonomic muscles
    such as the heart muscle, the smooth muscles of the gut,
    and the muscles of the many, highly specialised
    structures in the head &amp; neck region (derived from
    the pharyngeal arches in developmental terms). Some
    cranial nerves carry out both sensory and motor
    functions.</p>
<p>There is an intricate network of task sharing between
    groups of cranial and cervical nerves to accomplish some
    of the fiendishly complicated processes that are
    necessary for the smooth functioning of a living body.
    Given the many different functions of cranial and
    cervical nerves and the high density of these nerves in
    the head and neck area, it will not come as a surprise
    that these nerves, their wellbeing as well as all kinds
    of damage and repair to them, are a prominent topic in
    maxillofacial surgery. It will also not be a surprise
    that there is a bewildering range of neuropathies
    related to these two groups of nerves.</p>
<p>There is obviously some overlap with neurology as well as
    with many other medical specialties and thorough
    diagnosis is essential. It is important to ascertain
    that signs and symptoms are indeed caused by problems of
    the nerve(s), rather than by a functioning nerve in
    conjunction with a failure to process signals in the
    brain or a muscle-related problem.</p>
<p>Having said all of the above, some form of orderly
    discussion of this topic is desirable. Anatomy is a
    medical specialty with a particular tendency to
    classification and ordering in the description of
    complicated systems. For the following discussion, we
    adopt the anatomical approach to bringing some order to
    the theme of cranial and cervical nerves. The anatomical
    approach is to simply number the twelve pairs of cranial
    nerves according to their origin from the base of the
    brain (see Figure 1) I to XII. The eight pairs of
    cervical nerves originate from the spinal cord through
    the spaces between vertebrae; the cervical nerves are
    numbered from top to bottom 1 to 8. The cervical nerves
    originating from the bottom part of the cervical spinal
    cord (C5 to C8) have several functions overlapping with
    functions of some of the thoracic (chest region) spinal
    nerves, while C1 to C4 have some overlap in location and
    function with some of the cranial nerves.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-neuropathies-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A cartoon
        representation of the twelve cranial nerves I to XII
        (Roman numerals are the common label for these
        nerves) and their names; also indicated are their
        main function(s) as a sensory and/or motor nerve.
        Only one half of the paired nerves is shown.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to reach their destinations and target areas,
    the cranial nerves need to escape from the bony
    confinement of the skull. This happens either by a nerve
    passing through a small hole (a foramen) in the bone, or
    by a nerve travelling inside a hollow bony tube. These
    bony tubes may host more than one nerve branch as well
    as some blood vessels. While having a delicate structure
    protected by bone seems sensible, having it surrounded
    by something which does not expand creates many of the
    problems associated with the nervous system.</p>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-i-the-olfactory-nerve">Cranial nerve I, the olfactory nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The olfactory nerve is a sensory nerve. It is the
    shortest of the cranial nerves as it only travels from
    its origin (see Figure 1 above) to the nose where it
    provides for the sense of smell. Small volatile (odour)
    molecules enter the nasal cavity when inhaling. These
    molecules are sensed by a very large number of special
    olfactory receptor neurons in the many fibres of the
    olfactory nerve. The olfactory receptors are embedded in
    the mucosa (lining) of the nose where an initial
    response is triggered that leads to further signal
    transmission through the olfactory nerve to the brain.
    There the signal cascade is interpreted as the rich
    experience of smell.</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>are the inability to smell (anosmia) or a distorted sense
    of smell (parosmia), usually contributing to an overall
    <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">distortion or lack of
        taste</a> (because the perception of flavour is the
    result of complex combined smell and taste
    contributions).</p>
<p>Depending on the cause, the signs &amp; symptoms may be
    temporary or permanent, and may range from mild to
    severe.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> to the
        head, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a> of
        facial bones;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>
        such as infections of the respiratory tract or
        meningitis;</li>
    <li>compression by tumour growth (malignant as well as
        non-malignant masses) in the relevant maxillofacial
        region;</li>
    <li>primary neurological pathology (that is something
        specific to the central or peripheral nervous
        system, such as multiple sclerosis (central) or a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other">nerve sheath
            tumour (peripheral)</a>. This can apply to all
        the mentioned nerves.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-ii-the-optic-nerve">Cranial nerve II, the optic nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The optic nerve is a sensory nerve and is considered a
    part of the central nervous system (the brain) because
    some of its properties make it distinct from the other
    cranial nerves and akin to brain cells. The optic nerve
    enables vision. Its function involves picking up signals
    from photoreceptors in the retina (a region in the back
    of the eye that is equipped with light-sensitive
    molecules that trigger neural signals) which it
    transmits to the region of the brain responsible for
    processing of visual information (the visual cortex).
    There is a blind spot in the eye where the optic nerve
    exits the eye. The optic nerve of a human is made up of
    typically more than a million of nerve fibres.</p>
<p>Transmission of visual information by the optic nerve to
    the brain includes information about colour, contrast
    and brightness, as well as two reflexes. One of the two
    reflexes is the light reflex which regulates the
    synchronised constriction of the pupils of both eyes as
    a function of light intensity; the other reflex is the
    accommodation reflex that adjusts the acuity of vision
    as a function of distance / closeness of looking at
    objects by adjusting the lens.</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>include a range of different patterns of vision losses,
    both temporary and permanent, sudden or slowly
    developing. Vision loss can be blindness in one eye
    (monocular) or both eyes (bilateral). It is also
    possible that partial vision loss in one or both eyes
    occurs. This can take different forms, such as loss of
    vision in the outer half of the visual field of both
    eyes (bitemporal hemianopia), or loss of half of the
    visual field on the same side of both eyes (homonymous
    hemianopia).</p>
<p>There may be painful <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>
    of the optic nerve with loss of central vision. Swelling
    and oedema affecting the eyes can give rise to a range
    of different vision problems.</p>
<p>Depending on the cause, the signs &amp; symptoms may be
    temporary or permanent, and may range from mild to
    severe.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>mostly include systemic conditions such as multiple
    sclerosis or diabetes mellitus, or conditions affecting
    the central nervous system (for example stroke) or
    exposure to <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">high-energy
        radiation</a>, as well as specific ophthalmic (eye)
    conditions (such as glaucoma) and unknown causes
    (idiopathic).</p>
<p>In a more maxillofacial-focussed context, common causes
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> to the
        head, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a> of
        facial bones;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>
        such as infections of the head and neck region, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscesses</a> or
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess/more-info">cavernous
            sinus thrombosis</a>;</li>
    <li>compression by tumour growth (malignant as well as
        non-malignant masses) in the relevant head and neck
        region; for example, glioma of the optic nerve or a
        tumour of the pituitary gland, or compression due to
        swelling within the orbit (eye socket);</li>
    <li>primary neurological pathology.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-iii-the-oculomotor-nerve-cranial-nerve-iv-the-trochlear-nerve-cranial-nerve-vi-the-abducens-nerve">Cranial nerve III, the oculomotor nerve; cranial nerve
    IV, the trochlear nerve; cranial nerve VI, the abducens
    nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The oculomotor (III), the trochlear (IV) and the abducens
    (VI) nerves are all motor nerves; the three nerves
    together orchestrate the movements of the eyes in a
    coordinated fashion. Most of the eye’s movements are
    controlled by the oculomotor nerve (III), including
    constriction of the pupil, accommodation and opening of
    the eyelid. The trochlear (IV) and abducens (VI) nerves
    each control one specific muscle for eye movement: the
    trochlear nerve innervates the muscle responsible for
    rotational eye movement (superior oblique muscle), the
    abducens nerve innervates the muscle responsible for
    lateral eye movement (lateral rectus muscle).</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to one, some or all of the three cranial nerves III, IV
    and VI affect the movement of the eyeball(s) in several
    ways. Almost always some form of double vision
    (diplopia) will occur. Damage to the oculomotor (III)
    nerve can cause a lack of coordination and
    synchronisation of the eye movements (strabismus),
    drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis) and dilated
    pupils, in general the eye appears ‘down and out’.
    Damage to the trochlear (IV) nerve causes diplopia on
    looking down. Damage to the abducens (VI) nerve causes
    diplopia on looking sideways and may give rise to jerky
    involuntary eye movements (nystagmus).</p>

        rectus muscle following orbital floor fracture
        (fracture of the eye socket) but the appearance is
        the same as it would be if the trochlear nerve (IV)
        was damaged.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Depending on the cause, the signs &amp; symptoms may be
    temporary or permanent, and may range from mild to
    severe.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>include systemic conditions such as multiple sclerosis,
    or other brain lesions.</p>
<p>In a more maxillofacial-focussed context, common causes
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> to the
        head, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a> of
        facial or skull bones. The abducens nerve is
        particularly vulnerable to damage by fractures of
        the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">petrous temporal
            bone</a>. Curiously most double vision following
        maxillofacial trauma, particularly to the cheekbone
        and eye socket complex, is due to local mechanical
        trapping of muscle or inhibition of movement caused
        by scarring within the periorbital fat;</li>
    <li>compression by tumour growth (malignant as well as
        non-malignant masses) in the relevant head and neck
        region, or by aneurysms (bulging) of the internal
        carotid artery (the carotid arteries are the pair of
        large arteries along the neck providing blood supply
        to the head, brain, eyes, and other structures);
    </li>
    <li>primary neurological pathology.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-v-the-trigeminal-nerve">Cranial nerve V, the trigeminal nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The trigeminal nerve (V) is the regionally (in the head
    and neck region) most extensive of the cranial nerves.
    It has both motor and sensory functions for the face and
    the mouth. It is split into three main branches: i) the
    ophthalmic nerve (V<sub>1</sub>), ii) the maxillary
    nerve (V<sub>2</sub>), and iii) the mandibular nerve
    (V<sub>3</sub>). V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> are
    purely sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve,
    V<sub>3</sub> has motor and sensory functions.</p>
<p>The <strong>ophthalmic nerve
        V</strong><strong><sub>1</sub></strong> provides
    sensation to the skin, mucosa and sinuses of the upper
    face and scalp. After it exits the skull <i>via</i> the
    superior orbital fissure (cleft in the skull bones in
    the back of the eye socket), it separates into three
    branches: the frontal nerve, the lacrimal nerve, the
    nasociliary nerve. Between them these three branches
    provide sensory innervation for the forehead and scalp,
    the sinuses and the nasal cavity, upper eyelid, cornea
    and iris, the back (dorsum) of the nose, the lacrimal
    glands (glands producing tears; parasympathetic function
    of nerve fibres of V<sub>1</sub> form a part of the
    tear-secretion regulation). The innervation of the
    cornea by V<sub>1</sub> supports the corneal reflex
    (blinking triggered by touching the surface of the eye)
    by transmitting information to the brain, the facial
    nerve (VII; see below) activates the corneal reflex.</p>
<p>The <strong>maxillary nerve
        V</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong> provides
    sensation mostly to the mid third of the face. After
    exiting the skull, it divides into numerous sensory
    regional branches with further sub-branches. These
    numerous branches and sub-branches provide sensory
    functions to the lower eyelid, the lower back of the
    nasal cavity, the cheeks and sinus of the upper jaw, the
    side of the nose, the upper palate, the upper lip, teeth
    and gingiva (gums).</p>
<p>The <strong>mandibular nerve
        V</strong><strong><sub>3</sub></strong> innervates
    the muscles involved in biting and chewing, and some of
    the many muscles needed for <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowing</a>,
    in addition to its sensory functions. It has several
    sub-branches which together provide sensation to the
    skin in the lower third of the face, the teeth and gums
    (gingiva) in the lower jaw and the front part of the
    tongue (but not including taste sensation in that
    region; this is carried by a branch of the facial nerve
    (VII; see below)) and the floor of the mouth.</p>
<p>The <i>auriculotemporal nerve</i> <i>branch of
        V</i><i><sub>3</sub></i> innervates the outer ear,
    earlobe, outer ear canal and the middle ear, as well as
    the temple. The <i>buccal branch of
        V</i><i><sub>3</sub></i> provides sensation to the
    buccal mucosa (the cheek inside the mouth) and to the
    2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> molar teeth. The
    <i>inferior alveolar nerve branch of
        V</i><i><sub>3</sub></i> has both motor and sensory
    functions. Part of it innervates the mylohyoid and some
    of the digastric muscles (in the neck), which are
    necessary for swallowing. Another part of the inferior
    alveolar nerve branch of V<sub>3</sub> travels through
    some bony tunnel inside the mandibular (lower jaw) bone
    and provides sensation to the teeth in the mandible. At
    the front of the mandible, it exits the bony tunnel of
    the mandible through a small hole (the mental foramen).
    From there it is known as the <i>mental nerve</i> and
    supplies sensation to the lower lip and chin. The
    <i>lingual nerve branch of V</i><i><sub>3</sub></i> is a
    sensory nerve branch and provides sensation to the front
    two thirds of the tongue and the floor of the mouth.</p>
<p>The mandibular nerve carries motor fibres to various
    muscles in the head and neck. It innervates the muscles
    of mastication (chewing): the masseter, media and
    lateral pterygoid, temporalis and tensor tympani
    muscles, as well as some of the muscles required for
    swallowing (mylohyoid and anterior belly of digastric,
    tensor veli palatini muscles).</p>
<p>The <strong>trigeminal nerve</strong> itself does not
    carry any fibres of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous
    system but such nerve fibres from other cranial nerves
    hitchhike on the various branches of the trigeminal
    nerve to a common destination:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (VII;
        see below) travels with the lingual branch of the
        mandibular nerve and provides taste sensation to the
        front of the tongue, then it branches further to
        innervate the submandibular and sublingual salivary
        glands where it contributes to the saliva-secretion
        regulation;</li>
    <li>the auriculotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve
        provides passage for the autonomic nerve fibres of
        the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX; see below) for
        innervation of the parotid salivary gland where it
        forms part of the saliva-secretion regulation;</li>
    <li>autonomic fibres of the facial nerve (VII; see
        below) travel with the maxillary branch of the
        trigeminal nerve to the lacrimal glands and the
        nasal mucous glands where these fibres contribute to
        the glands’ secretion regulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the trigeminal nerve are as varied as the different
    functionalities of this nerve; signs and symptoms depend
    on the location and cause of the damage. Signs and
    symptoms of damage include absent corneal reflex, absent
    or distorted sensation in the areas supplied by the
    sensory functions of the trigeminal nerve, weakness of
    the muscles of mastication (chewing muscles). Damage to
    a peripheral branch of the trigeminal nerve may be more
    specific, according to the specific functionalities of
    the branch. An example is the initially numb area over
    the cheek when a fractured cheekbone presses on the
    infraorbital nerve lying in the eye socket. The entire
    area below the eye and extending to the side of the
    nose, lip and gums may be numb. Over time, if the
    compression is removed by returning the bone to its
    proper position, the numbness may gradually vanish,
    become an irritating sensation which never quite goes
    away (although one can become used to it), or even get
    worse. It really is unpredictable.  </p>
<p>Depending on the cause, the signs &amp; symptoms may be
    temporary or permanent, and may range from mild to
    severe.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>generally include brain lesions (strokes and/or tumours
    in several areas of the brain, especially near the
    brainstem, affect the trigeminal nerve), multiple
    sclerosis and diabetes mellitus.  </p>
<p>In a more maxillofacial-focussed context, common causes
    of damage to the peripheral section of the trigeminal
    nerve include</p>

    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> to the
        head, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a> of

</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-vii-the-facial-nerve">Cranial nerve VII, the facial nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The facial nerve (VII) has both motor and sensory
    functions. It first follows a fairly complicated path in
    the skull, passing very close to the inner ear, before
    it enters its extracranial (outside the skull) path,
    there running just to the front of the outer ear.
    Intracranially (inside the skull) it divides into three
    branches: the greater petrosal neve (provides
    innervation and regulation to mucous and lacrimal
    glands), the nerve to stapedius (motor function for the
    stapedius muscle, small muscle of the middle ear), and
    the chorda tympani (sensory innervation, sense of taste
    in the front part of the tongue and innervation to the
    submandibular and sublingual salivary glands). The
    chorda tympani hitchhikes on the lingual nerve
    (trigeminal nerve, V; see above) toward the base of the
    tongue before continuing toward the submandibular and
    sublingual salivary glands. The lingual nerve provides
    sensation to the front two thirds of the tongue, the
    chorda tympani fibres provide taste sensation for this
    part of the tongue.</p>
<p>The main branch of the facial nerve runs through the
    parotid (salivary) gland, where it divides into five
    sub-branches: temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal
    mandibular and cervical branches. These five motor
    branches innervate the facial muscles that are
    responsible for facial expression. The facial nerve is
    embedded in the parotid gland tissue but does not
    innervate the parotid gland. The gland is innervated by
    the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX; see below). Several more
    motor nerve branches emerge: the posterior auricular
    nerve (serving muscles of the outer ear), the nerve to
    the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the
    nerve to the stylohyoid muscle (muscles in the neck,
    involved with swallowing, speaking and breathing).  </p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the facial nerve are diverse. Given its multiple
    functions and anatomical paths, the signs and symptoms
    depend on the location and cause of the damage.
    Intracranial lesions of the facial nerve affect both its
    motor and sensory functions, extracranial lesions only
    affect its motor functions.</p>
<p>Intracranial lesions lead to paralysis or severe weakness
    of the muscles of facial expression. In addition, there
    may be sensitivity to sound, loss or distortion of
    taste, reduced salivary and / or lacrimal secretion,
    distorted sensation. Extracranial lesions lead to
    paralysis or severe weakness of the muscles of facial
    expression.</p>

<h1 id="cranial-nerve-viii-the-vestibulocochlear-nerve">Cranial nerve VIII, the vestibulocochlear nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The vestibulocochlear nerve is a purely sensory nerve. It
    consists of two strands of nerve tissue, vestibular and
    cochlear fibres. The vestibular part of the nerve
    reports balance information to the brain, the cochlear
    part transmits hearing information, in the form of
    amplitude and frequency of sound waves, from the ear to
    the brain.</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the vestibulocochlear nerve include hearing loss,

</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-ix-the-glossopharyngeal-nerve">Cranial nerve IX, the glossopharyngeal nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The glossopharyngeal nerve has various different motor
    and sensory functions, including some special functions.
    Its various branches provide sensory functions to the
    mouth and throat (including the tonsils and parts of the
    carotid artery), the back part of the tongue (including
    taste sensation for this part of the tongue), the middle
    ear and the Eustachian tube (connects the middle ear
    with nose and throat). Its motor function is to
    innervate one of the muscles in the pharynx required for
    swallowing (the stylopharyngeus muscle). In addition,
    the glossopharyngeal nerve has a special function in
    that it provides autonomic (involuntary) parasympathetic
    innervation to the parotid salivary gland and thus is
    part of the saliva-flow regulation system. It is
    connected with the auriculotemporal nerve (a cervical
    spine nerve; see below) in approaching the parotid
    gland. One of the branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve
    serving the back of the mouth and throat is closely
    linked with the vagus nerve(X; see below). This
    relationship of the two nerves is functionally
    important: the glossopharyngeal nerve provides the
    sensory (afferent) information for the gag (and
    vomiting) reflex to the brain, the (efferent) motor
    instruction from the brain for the gag reflex is carried
    by the vagus nerve to the back of the tongue / throat.
</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the glossopharyngeal nerve include the loss of the gag
    reflex and specific <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing
        difficulties</a>, loss of sensation (anaesthesia) in
    the back of the mouth and throat, and/or problems with
    speech. Often problems arise from damage to both the
    glossopharyngeal and vagus (X; see below) nerves, or
    from damage to the vestibulocochlear (VIII; see above)
    and the glossopharyngeal nerves. A sign and symptom of
    damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve may be
    glossopharyngeal neuralgia (intermittent pain at the
    base of the tongue and palate).</p>
<p>Depending on the cause, the signs &amp; symptoms may be
    temporary or permanent, and may range from mild to
    severe.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>include brainstem lesions (in particular ischaemic
    stroke), Parkinson’s disease (where tremor can affect
    the muscles in the throat), a range of motor neuron
    diseases.</p>
<p>In a more maxillofacial-focussed context, common causes

<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> to the
        head, such as skull base <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a> or

        region, for example malignant tumour of the tonsil.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-x-the-vagus-nerve">Cranial nerve X, the vagus nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>Similar to the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX; see above)
    also the vagus nerve has a diverse range of functions.
    It extends far beyond the head and neck region all the
    way to the abdomen and travels furthest of all cranial
    nerves. Most of its fibres are sensory (thus reporting
    status and condition to the brain) but some of its
    fibres also execute instructions from the brain locally.
    The various branches of the vagus nerve provide sensory
    functions by innervating the skin of the outer ear canal
    (the auricular nerve), the mucosa in the throat as well
    as sampling visceral sensation from heart, lungs and
    digestive tract. A special sensory nerve function is the
    provision of taste sensation at the root of the tongue.
    In its motor function, it innervates most of the muscles
    of the soft palate, the pharynx (upper throat) and the
    larynx (lower throat). It further innervates the smooth
    muscles of the windpipe, lungs and digestive tract and
    is involved in the regulation of the heartbeat. It
    mediates the gag reflex (together with the
    glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), see above) and the cough
    reflex.</p>
<p>The pharynx and larynx muscles innervated by the vagus
    nerve are necessary to start the <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowing
        process</a> and for the production of speech sounds.
    The vagus nerve plays a major role in the regulation of
    the heart rate by reducing and maintaining the rate at
    rest. In the gastro-intestinal system the vagus nerve
    branches in this region stimulate secretion of the
    various glands (including sweating and acid production
    in the stomach) and contraction of smooth muscles in the
    digestive tract.</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the vagus nerve often are the effects of combined
    damage to include the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX; see
    above) and accessory nerve (XI; see below). Given the
    many functionalities of the vagus nerve, signs and
    symptoms of damage to it are manifold and varied,
    ranging from pain in the mouth to accelerated rate of
    heart beat and increase in blood pressure, to breathing
    problems, to hoarse voice and general <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">difficulties with
        swallowing</a> and speech. Signs and symptoms of
    vagus nerve damage depend on the exact location of the
    damage.</p>
<p>Depending on the cause, the signs &amp; symptoms may be
    temporary or permanent, and may range from mild to
    severe.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>include brain lesions, metabolic disorders (such as
    diabetes mellitus or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency),
    degenerative conditions such as motor neurone disease,
    or multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>In a more maxillofacial-focussed context, common causes
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> to the
        head, such as skull base <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a>;

    <li>iatrogenic from procedures such as thyroid or
        carotid surgery;</li>

        head and neck region, including for example <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastasis</a>
        from lung and other chest malignancies;</li>
    <li>primary neurological pathology, such as nerve sheath
        tumour (schwannoma).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-xi-the-accessory-nerve">Cranial nerve XI, the accessory nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The accessory nerve is a motor nerve. It has dual
    character in terms of its anatomical origins; this
    two-component view is the traditional anatomical
    description of the accessory nerve. The main part of the
    accessory nerve is made up of nerve fibres that stem
    from cervical spinal nerves C1 to C5 (see below). The
    smaller cranial part of the accessory nerve travels with
    the glossopharyngeal (IX) and vagus (X) nerves (see
    above) on exiting the skull. An alternative anatomical
    view considers the cranial part of the accessory nerve
    as a part of the vagus (X) nerve, and the accessory
    nerve itself is then seen as a purely cervical spinal
    nerve (see below).</p>
<p>Independent of its systematic anatomical descriptions,
    the accessory nerve innervates two muscles of the neck:
    the sternocleidomastoid muscle (running along the side
    of the neck) and the trapezius muscle (large muscle of
    the back, extending to head and neck). The accessory
    nerve in conjunction with these two muscles enables
    extension, lateral flexion and rotation of the neck, as
    well as elevation and rotation of the scapula (shoulder
    blade) related to abduction of the arm.</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the accessory nerve are difficulties with moving head,
    neck and shoulders, a limited range of motion, weakness
    and shoulder pain. Over time with long-standing nerve
    damage, the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles
    may weaken. This can lead to a non-symmetrical neckline.

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Condition after
        bilateral neck dissections. The morbidity caused by

        drooping shoulder, loss of neck volume and symptoms
        of shoulder pain, stiffness and lack of sensation.
        The side that underwent selective neck dissection is
        much less morbid.</figcaption>

</ul>
<h1 id="cranial-nerve-xii-the-hypoglossal-nerve">Cranial nerve XII, the hypoglossal nerve</h1>
<h2>Type and function</h2>
<p>The hypoglossal nerve is a motor nerve, it innervates all
    the tongue muscles with one exception (the palatoglossus
    muscle which is controlled by the vagus nerve (X), see
    above; as an alternative view, fibres of the hypoglossal
    nerve may be seen as intermingled with the vagus nerve).
    A branch of the hypoglossal nerve connects with a branch
    of the first cervical spinal nerve, C1 (see below). The
    hypoglossal nerve connects to the tongue from the bottom
    region of the floor of the mouth and travels through
    otherwise densely innervated areas that are also rich in
    blood vessels.</p>
<p>The mostly voluntary and some involuntary functions of
    the tongue are necessary for speech, <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowing</a>
    and manipulation of food in the mouth (formation of a
    bolus, ready to swallow). The clearing of saliva from
    the mouth is the predominant involuntary function, as
    well as some acquired functions for speech and
    articulation – which are specific to particular sounds
    in different languages.</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the hypoglossal nerve are difficulties with speech
    (slurred speech), chewing and swallowing (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>) as
    well as disturbed sensation of the tongue
    (dysaesthesia). Over time additional weakness of the
    tongue muscles may develop, such atrophy (wasting away)
    of the tongue musculature can add to the signs and
    symptoms of damage to the hypoglossal nerve. Often, the
    tongue cannot be moved symmetrically and will deviate to
    the affected side.</p>
<p>Depending on the cause, the signs &amp; symptoms may be
    temporary or permanent, and may range from mild to
    severe.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>include systemic conditions such as multiple sclerosis,
    or brain lesions and stroke, and motor neurone disease;
    damage to the hypoglossal nerve is rare.</p>
<p>In a more maxillofacial-focussed context, common causes
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> to the
        head, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a> of
        facial or jaw bones, in particular condyle fractures
        (fractures of the top part of the lower jaw bone).
        Because of the path of the hypoglossal nerve and its
        proximity to other functionalities and structures,
        it is rare that this nerve is damaged in isolation;
    </li>
    <li>surgical procedures can damage the hypoglossal
        nerve. In its path to the tongue it may very rarely
        be damaged during <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">submandibular
            gland excision</a> or <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">neck

</ul>
<h1 id="cervical-spinal-nerves">Cervical spinal nerves</h1>
<p>The cranial nerves I to XII each have predominantly
    individual character, despite some degrees of ‘task
    sharing’ and occupying shared spaces. The cervical
    spinal nerves have individually identifiable roots –
    where they originate from the spinal cord through the
    spaces between vertebrae – but they form more integrated
    networks of cooperative nerve actions. Such an
    integrated network is called a plexus. The cervical
    spinal nerves can be grouped into two such branched
    functional networks: the <strong>cervical
        plexus</strong> formed by the spinal nerves C1 to
    C4; the <strong>brachial plexus</strong> formed by the
    spinal nerves C5 to C8. We include a brief description
    of the cervical spinal nerves because of their
    functional overlap and intermixing with some of the
    cranial nerves.</p>
<h2>Cervical spinal nerves C1 to C4; the cervical plexus
</h2>
<p>The branches of the cervical plexus C1 to C4 mostly serve
    the head and neck region, with both motor and sensory
    functions. The motor components innervate muscles of the
    neck, back and the diaphragm (the major muscle which
    serves to inflate the lungs; innervated by branches from
    C3, C4 and C5). Branches of C1, together with parts of
    the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII; see above)
    innervate several smaller muscles required to move the
    hyoid bone (a small bent bone in the neck, supporting
    the tongue). This is an essential function for speech
    and swallowing. The cervical plexus is also closely
    connected with the accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI;
    see above).</p>
<p>The sensory components of the cervical plexus generally
    provide sensation to the skin of the upper chest, neck,
    ear and scalp. More specifically, branches of C2 and C3
    form the <i>greater auricular nerve</i> which travels
    upwards, provides sensation to parts of the outer ear
    and the skin over the parotid gland, and is
    interconnected with the <i>auricular branches</i> of the
    vagus nerve (X; see above) and the facial nerve (VII;
    see above).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Horner syndrome
        (miosis (constricted pupil), ptosis (drooping of the
        upper eyelid) and anhidrosis (absence of sweating of
        the face)) from damage to the sympathetic nerve
        chain (part of the autonomous / involuntary nerve
        supply to the eye).</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Cervical spinal nerves C5 to C8; the brachial plexus
</h2>
<p>The brachial plexus formed by C5 to C8, plus the first of
    the spinal nerves of the thorax, T1, is a complicated
    network of major and minor branches. It provides both
    motor and sensory functions to the upper limbs (arms and
    hands / fingers).</p>
<h2>Consequences of damage</h2>
<p>to the brachial plexus include lack of, or distorted
    sensation (dysaesthesia) in the shoulder, arm or hand as
    well as weakness of the muscles in these structures,
    extending to paralysis in severe cases. Severe damage to
    C4 and C5 can cause breathing difficulties. Damage to
    the cervical plexus leads to distorted sensation in the
    areas innervated by this plexus, as well as difficulties
    with speech and swallowing when the motor branches of C1
    are damaged.</p>
<h2>Common causes of damage</h2>
<p>include a herniated disc or trauma to the neck (from
    injury or surgery).</p>
<p>In a more maxillofacial-focussed context, common causes
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>surgical procedures such as <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">parotidectomy
            (excision of the parotid gland)</a> or <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">neck
            dissection</a>, leading to altered sensation of
        the earlobe and surrounding area.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-most-common-maxillofacial-neuropathies">The most common maxillofacial neuropathies</h1>
<p>Neuropathies in a maxillofacial context are an extremely
    broad theme, in several regards. There is much overlap
    with conditions that are commonly referred to as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">facial
        pain syndromes</a>, including some <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-pain-syndrome">treatment
        options</a> as well as common limitations to the
    management of many of these conditions. Furthermore, the
    whole spectrum of severity of neuropathies needs to be
    kept in mind. The range covers minor nuisances from
    temporarily slightly disturbed or reduced sensation
    (minor cases of dysaesthesia), to severe and lasting
    forms of dysaesthesia (sensory nerves), or severe,
    painful and lasting signs and symptoms of damage to
    motor and/or sensory nerves.</p>
<p>Both the ability (and willingness) to cope with lasting,
    sometimes life-changing disturbances varies strongly
    between individuals, including <a href="/help/mental-health">mood and mental
        health</a> aspects. Not only general resilience is
    individually very different, also the perception of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">pain</a>
    varies widely between individuals; one person’s
    unbearable pain is somebody else’s modest disturbance.
    In fact, it is not well understood why <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">pain
        perception</a> varies so widely; in part this may be
    attributed to the fact that it is not really possible to
    objectively determine degrees of pain or discomfort.</p>
<p>Neuropathies commonly encountered in maxillofacial
    surgery include damage to</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cranial nerves III, IV, VI: superior orbital fissure
        syndrome; rare and usually of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">traumatic</a>
        origin. The superior orbital fissure is a cleft in
        the skull bones forming the eye socket (at the back
        of the eye socket), a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fracture</a> of
        this bony structure can cause damage to some or all

        in short intense bursts. This disorder may be seen a
        little bit like epilepsy in reverse; this is the
        reason why carbamazepine and other <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant
            agents</a> serve both diagnostic and treatment
        purposes.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve V: damage to the lingual nerve (part
        of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve
        (V<sub>3</sub>)) by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">surgical
            removal of third molars</a> (wisdom teeth) or
        other oral &amp; maxillofacial surgery. In the
        majority of cases the damage is a temporary and
        relatively minor nuisance, but there is a minority
        of cases where the damage is more severe and
        permanent.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve V: damage to the inferior alveolar
        nerve (part of the mandibular branch of the
        trigeminal nerve (V<sub>3</sub>)), usually by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> (such as
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fracture</a> of
        the mandible) or surgery but also by compression
        from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone
            lesions</a> such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>, or other
        voluminous growth.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve V: damage to the mental nerve (the
        name of the inferior alveolar nerve after it exits
        its bony channel along the mandible through the
        mental foramen (a small hole in the front part of
        the mandible)), under normal conditions
        indistinguishable from other alveolar nerve injury
        but arising from damage to the mental branch of the
        nerve, usually from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> or
        surgical interventions.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve V: damage to the infraorbital nerve
        (part of the maxillary branch of the trigeminal
        nerve (V<sub>2</sub>)) typically causing altered
        sensation after <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">cheekbone
            fracture</a> or orbital (affecting the eye
        socket) surgery.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve VII: damage to the chorda tympani
        branch of the facial nerve causes taste
        disturbances; a potential complication of surgery to
        the middle ear.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve VII: Bell’s palsy (paralysis is often
        temporary), a neurological condition of the facial
        nerve, cause unknown but <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">viral
            infections</a> (herpes zoster (shingles)) and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">immune
            system</a> dysfunction have been considered.
        Onset is typically sudden, with a typical
        asymmetrical facial appearance caused by the
        paralysis of the facial muscles innervated by the
        (motor) nerve.</li>
    <li>Cranial neve VII: Ramsey-Hunt syndrome (also known
        as herpes zoster oticus), a paralysis of the facial
        nerve with vesiculation (blisters and a red rash)
        around the ear on the affected side. The condition
        occurs when an outbreak of shingles affects the
        facial nerve near the ear, it causes a painful rush,
        facial paralysis and hearing loss on the affected
        side.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve VII: Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is
        a rare neurological condition which causes recurring
        facial paralysis alongside fissuring of the tongue
        and swelling of the upper lip and face. The cause is
        not known but genetic origin has been discussed.
    </li>
    <li>Cranial nerve VII: direct tumour invasion (malignant
        as well as non-malignant growths), <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> and
        surgery can all cause paralysis of the respective
        branch of the facial nerve. These conditions are
        known as lower motor neuron paralysis where the
        function of the whole nerve is affected. These
        paralyses are different from upper motor neuron
        paralyses which originate from a central (brain)
        lesion such as a stroke, where the motor nerve
        supply to the forehead is maintained to a degree. An
        example of a complete lower motor neuron paralysis
        is shown in Figure 6.</li>

    <li>Cranial nerve VIII: damage to the vestibulocochlear
        nerve, causing hearing and balance problems; this is
        typically more in the realm of ear, nose and throat
        (ENT) surgery and clinic.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerves IX, X: damage to the glossopharyngeal
        and vagus nerves (the pharyngeal plexus) iatrogenic
        from surgical procedures or by compression, causing
        swallowing difficulties.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve XI: damage to the accessory nerve
        leading to limitation of movement of the shoulder
        and neck on the affected side; this damage is
        usually caused by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a> or
        surgery, for example following <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">neck
            dissection</a> or other neck surgery.</li>
    <li>Cranial nerve XII: damage to the hypoglossal nerve
        causing deviation of the tongue to the affected side
        and weakness of the tongue; either caused by central
        nervous system (brain) lesions such as stroke, or
        (rarely) by surgery deep in the neck or floor of
        mouth, or as an extremely rare complication of <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">excision
            of the submandibular (salivary) gland</a>.</li>
    <li>Cervical plexus: altered sensation over the skin of
        the neck on affected side, most commonly numbness
        over the ear lobe and surrounding skin.</li>
