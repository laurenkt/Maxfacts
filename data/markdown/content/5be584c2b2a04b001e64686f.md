<p>Clodronate belongs to a category of medications known as <a href="/treatment-other-medications-miscellaneous-antiresorptive">antiresorptives</a>.
    More specifically, clodronate is one of a number of different
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>    within this category of medications (Figure 1). Bisphosphonates
    are medications used for the treatment of osteoporosis (brittle
    bones) and <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/metastases">bone metastases</a>.</p>

<p>The most prominent aspect of antiresorptive medications in an
    oral and maxillofacial surgery context are their adverse
    effects. Antiresorptive medications are the most common cause
    of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">necrosis of the jaw bones</a>,
    known as MRONJ (medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the bone remodelling and
        how antiresorptive medications interfere with this process,
        this is discussed on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">hard tissue necrosis</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Antiresorptive medications are normally not prescribed in maxillofacial
    surgery. However, here we mention clodronate separately as
    an occasional exception. Clodronate is one of three components
    of a controversial medication scheme, advertised for the
    treatment of <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue/detailed">osteoradionecrosis</a>,
    a severe long-term (life-long) risk following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    in the head &amp; neck region. The cocktail of medicinal
    drugs, also known as ‘triple therapy’ or PENTOCLO, consists
    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/pentoxifylline">pentoxifylline</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/tocopherol">tocopherol</a>    and clodronate. The evidence base about the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">working principles of this medication scheme</a>    and the related hypotheses about the pathology of osteoradionecrosis
    are conflicted. In addition, the original ‘triple therapy’
    has sometimes become ‘penta-therapy’ with the rather random
    addition of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">ciprofloxacin</a>    (an antibacterial agent) and <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-steroid">prednisolone</a>    (a steroid) twice a week. It strikes one as counterintuitive
    to prescribe a drug for the treatment of osteoradionecrosis,
    when <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>    themselves are known to carry an enhanced and long-term risk
    for causing osteonecrosis of the jaws. Accordingly, there
    has been a reluctance to include clodronate in medication
    schemes for treating osteoradionecrosis of the jaws. It is
    also worth mentioning that in the UK the National Institute
    for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends PENTOCLO
    / ‘triple therapy’ for the treatment of osteoradonecrosis
    of the jaws in the framework of clinical trials but not otherwise.</p>
<p>The combination of drugs in ‘triple therapy’ was originally proposed
    for the treatment of fibrosis (scar formation) and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">soft-tissue necrosis</a>    after radiotherapy treatment of breast cancer. So far, it
    has not been convincingly explained how and why exactly the
    same considerations and treatment should apply for the treatment
    of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws.</p>
