<p>A wide range of drugs, both prescription and non-prescription,
    are used for purposes they are not primarily intended for.
    In the case of alcohol, nicotine and caffeine it could be
    argued that they are used for their intended purpose, the
    problem is when they are used to excess, inappropriately
    or a dependence is formed.</p>
<p>Societies vary hugely in their attitudes to these drugs. For
    example, alcohol is freely available, taxed and forms part
    of culture in some countries whereas it is illegal in others.</p>
<p>Criminalisation of a health problem is seldom a successful strategy
    and in the UK excessive drug use and dependence is regarded
    as a health problem by formal medical representative bodies
    such as the BMA (British Medical Association). However, many
    regularly used drugs are illegal and criminalised despite
    a lack of evidence that this reduces the harm caused.</p>
<p>Some of the more common drugs that may influence your problems
    and/or treatment are:</p>
<h1 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h1>
<p>Alcohol, or more specifically ethanol in beer, wine and spirits,
    is potentially highly addictive. It is well documented that
    excessive alcohol consumption causes physical (for example,
    liver disease), psychological and societal damage. In addition,
    excessive alcohol consumption hampers recovery and rehabilitation
    in oral and maxillofacial surgery. High alcohol intake is
    also associated with an increased risk of malignancies although
    alcohol is not necessarily causative in all cases.</p>
<h1 id="amphetamines">Amphetamines</h1>
<p>Amphetamine is a chemical which acts as a strong stimulant; its
    legal prescription use is in the treatment of narcolepsy.
    Relatively minor chemical modifications of the basic amphetamine
    molecular structure have resulted in many substances being
    classified as amphetamine-like substances. Their power, type
    of effect and mode of application vary <em>per</em> the specific
    compound but all are potent stimulants and all produce severe
    hangover-like effects. Some well-known examples include ecstasy,
    crystal meth and speed. Some of these drugs are highly addictive
    (for example, crystal meth), others are not addictive (for
    example, ecstasy). Most of them have not been assessed for
    safety and they are normally not produced under quality-controlled
    professional laboratory conditions (except for ‘military
    grade amphetamine’ being widely used in military forces since
    1940). Accordingly, consumption of these street-bought drugs
    is inherently dangerous from either the effects of the drug
    substance itself, from dosage errors or from impurities.</p>
<h1 id="hormones-anabolic-androgenic-steroids">Hormones, anabolic-androgenic steroids</h1>
<p>Chemical messengers known as hormones play a role in the regulation
    of various bodily functions. Naturally occurring testosterone
    is the male sex hormone; its anabolic role is to increase
    muscle and bone mass, its androgenic role is a virilising
    effect, for example increasing the amount of body hair. Synthetic
    versions of chemicals with similar effects to testosterone
    are called anabolic-androgenic steroids. They lend themselves
    to cheating in sports such as weight lifting where unfair
    advantage can be had from increased muscle mass by taking
    anabolic steroids. Such overuse comes at a considerable risk
    of suffering harmful side effects such as dangerously increased
    blood pressure, or developing serious cardiovascular conditions
    or liver damage.</p>
<p>Another well-known example of a hormone with both performance
    enhancing effects and potentially lethal side effects is
    so called EPO (erythropoietin). EPO is a naturally occurring
    hormone that is synthesized in the kidneys and stimulates
    the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in bone
    marrow. This explains its medical use in treating some forms
    of anaemia. Higher levels of red blood cells are equivalent
    to improved oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, resulting
    in enhanced endurance. EPO has been used as ‘blood doping’
    for a long time in various endurance sports and only recently
    has it become possible to identify EPO doping. EPO abuse
    is infamous in the tour de France and similar endurance events.
    Dangerous side effects of EPO overuse result from its effect
    on blood viscosity, including sudden deaths.</p>
<h1 id="stimulants-caffeine-and-cocaine">Stimulants, caffeine and cocaine</h1>
<p>Found in tea, coffee, energy drinks and some non-prescription
    drugs, caffeine increases alertness and energy. Despite being
    a common drug, excessive consumption can result in undesirable
    effects ranging from dehydration to insomnia and heart palpitations.</p>
<p>Cocaine is an illegal stimulant, it is not particularly addictive
    but habit-forming and tolerance develops rapidly (there are
    well-functioning professionals who happen to be cocaine users).
    Cocaine causes local harm to nasal tissue from snorting it.</p>
<h1 id="hallucinogens">Hallucinogens</h1>
<p>The broad term hallucinogen covers a range of substances that
    cause disruption to the central nervous system: the user’s
    perception of reality is distorted resulting in effects such
    as hallucinations and wild mood swings. These hallucinations
    are largely a sensory amplification and distortion; some
    of us growing up in the 1960ies may well remember ‘Deep Purple’,
    or ’tangerine dreams’, and so on. Ketamine and LSD (‘acid’)
    are examples of synthetic hallucinogenic substances. Synthetic
    hallucinogens are not addictive but individual experiences
    from taking them may vary widely. Magic mushrooms (for example,
    mescaline as the active component) occur naturally and have
    been used in all kinds of rituals for thousands of years.</p>
<h1 id="inhalants">Inhalants</h1>
<p>A variety of volatile substances found in glues, aerosols, ‘poppers’
    and ‘whippets’ may be inhaled to induce a high, usually only
    a short-lasting effect. Dosage of gaseous substances is difficult
    to control without some technical equipment such as a flowmeter.
    Hence usage can be dangerous irrespective of the number of
    times taken (for example, collapse caused by dangerously
    lowered blood pressure). The classical examples of inhalants
    are ether and nitrous oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O (also known as
    ‘laughing gas’), causing dizziness and a degree of euphoria.
    More recently, a variety of volatile alkylnitrites (‘poppers’)
    have found use as recreational drugs, often in combination
    with other drugs. Most, if not all, of these substances are
    easily accessible owing to their multiple alternative legal
    uses.</p>
<h1 id="nicotine">Nicotine</h1>
<p>As a highly addictive, harmful and yet legal drug, nicotine continues
    to cause more damage than all illegal drugs combined. Nicotine
    has traditionally been consumed through tobacco leaves in
    a variety of ways such as smoking, chewing and snuff, although
    more recent methods such as vaping supply nicotine more directly,
    in water vapour. Smoking is considered the most harmful way
    of nicotine consumption due to the hundreds of harmful chemicals
    and particles contained in the inhaled smoke. The significantly
    increased risk of smokers to develop lung diseases and/or
    cardiovascular conditions is well documented. Whatever the
    method of intake, the harmful effects are augmented through
    combination with alcohol. In the context of oral and maxillofacial
    conditions it is especially the combination of smoking with
    alcohol consumption that has been shown to be strongly correlated
    with an increased risk of developing head and neck malignancies.</p>
<h1 id="opioids">Opioids</h1>
<p>Opioids represent a vast category of drugs that are all chemically
    related to one another. Many opioids such as codeine and
    morphine are used legally as analgesics, or methadone is
    used as a substitute in the management of heroin addiction,
    and even the active component of cannabis (tetrahydrocannabinol,
    THC) can be prescribed for clinical purposes in treating
    chronic pain. The many different substances in this category
    are addictive to variable degrees. Overdosing of opioids
    can, and does, produce catastrophic effects such as respiratory
    arrest (breathing stops). The highly addictive nature of
    many opioids can result in criminality to fund the dependence.
    Opioid addiction has fuelled long standing debates in many
    societies on how best to deal with the issue. More recently
    the debate also includes findings that widely prescribed
    analgesics such as tramadol can (and do) lead to dependence
    even if used <em>per</em> prescription, and in consequence
    add to a flourishing illegal black market of legal drugs.</p>
<h1 id="tranquilizers">Tranquilizers</h1>
<p>Similarly, to the opioids above, tranquilizers incorporate a
    broad range of drugs, some of which are legally used as prescription
    drugs. Major tranquilizers act as antipsychotics whereas
    minor tranquilizers such as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and
    diazepam induce relaxation, calmness or sleep. Minor tranquilizers
    are more likely to cause dependencies and abuse. Within the
    class of minor tranquilizers further subcategories exist
    such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and the so-called Z-drugs
    (zopiclone, zolpidem). Widespread prescription, in particular
    of the latter, has also resulted in their appearance on the
    illegal drug market, similar to the illegal trade of prescription
    opioids. In high dosage and when combined with other drugs,
    particularly with alcohol, most tranquilizers can have dangerous
    effects.</p>
<p>The above list of drugs that find recreational use, legal or
    illegal, is by no means exhaustive but illustrates how wide
    the field <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/further-reading">of recreational drug use</a>    is. Various problems can arise from the different categories
    of drugs in the short and/or long term; some having a negative
    impact on the prognosis of treatment. Understanding the ways
    in which these drugs work can help in reducing or preferably
    stopping their usage, therefore improving the outcome of
    treatment. The legality of drugs should not lead one to conclude
    that legality is equal to a low, or no, destructive potential;
    for example, the destructive potential of the legal drugs
    alcohol and nicotine vastly outweighs that of the illegal
    recreational drugs.</p>
<p>In the UK, many institutions and charities offer <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/further-reading">support</a>    in non-judgmental ways with the management of addictions
    as well as offering help with attempts to terminate substance
    abuse.</p>
