<p>The treatment of shoulder issues lies largely in the areas of
    <a href="/help/physiotherapy">physiotherapy</a> and, rarely,
    orthopaedic or upper limb surgery. Treatment of postoperative
    problems affecting the shoulder include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Physiotherapy to mobilise, reduce discomfort and improve
        function. <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">Neck dissections</a>        of all types interfere to a greater or lesser extent
        with the spinal accessory nerve. This nerve provides
        part of the motor innervation to the trapezius muscle
        and the sternomastoid muscle both of which have an important
        role in shoulder stabilisation and mobility (trapezius
        by far the greater).</li>
    <li>Analgesia. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Pain</a>        may be caused by muscle spasm or impingement of the muscles,
        tendons and bone of the shoulder as a result of trapezius
        muscle dysfunction. A range of suitable analgesics is
        available for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">pain relief</a>.</li>
    <li>Counterirritation or similar techniques may help <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">altered sensation</a>.</li>
    <li>Genuine impingement or mechanical dysfunction may require
        upper limb surgical input. This is exceptionally rare.</li>
</ul>
