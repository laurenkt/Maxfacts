<p>We keep the oroantral communication / oroantral fistula as our
    worked example of treatment in a maxillofacial context. For
    this particular condition there is a timeline, with different
    treatment approaches.</p>
<h1 id="treatment-of-a-primary-oroantral-communication">Treatment of a primary oroantral communication</h1>
<p>Treatment of a primary oroantral communication is to simply remove
    the tooth and any fragments of bone. Mobilising local gingivae
    and primary closure of the socket with a suture should allow
    a healthy clot to form within the area of communication.
    There is a high likelihood that this will heal. It is advisable
    to avoid nose blowing while the communication is healing.
    Temporary use of a nasal <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/decongestant">decongestant</a>    such as xylometazoline or oxymetazoline may be helpful, a
    course of broad-spectrum <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial medication</a>,
    for example amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (effective against
    oral and nasal pathogens), may be required. The healing process
    needs to be reviewed to ensure that the communication has
    indeed healed and an oroantral fistula, with epithelial lining
    of the communication, has not formed.</p>
<h1 id="treatment-of-established-oroantral-fistula">Treatment of established oroantral fistula</h1>
<p>Once a fistula is established treatment will require formal excision
    of the fistulous tract to gain healing both of the antral
    lining and of the oral lining. There are various surgical
    methods to achieve this.</p>
<p>The principles of treatment are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>complete excision of the epithelial-lined tract;</li>
    <li>removal of any foreign bodies;</li>
    <li>mobilisation of tissue on the oral side and closure using
        an incision line that is capable of healing by primary
        intention.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the incision line must rest on healthy bone or
    on another layer of vascularised tissue. There are three
    basic ways to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the buccal advancement flap;</li>
    <li>the buccal fat pad flap;</li>
    <li>the palatal finger flap.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Buccal advancement flap</h2>
<p>This procedure uses a three-sided <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">advancement flap</a>    of buccal mucosa. The flap is mobilised by making an incision
    through the periosteum to allow the flap to be stretched
    without tension over the defect (Figure 1).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-fistula-level2-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A buccal advancement flap is raised
        and mobilised by incising the periosteum. This also allows
        access to the buccal pad of fat (see below).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is essential that the suture line rests on sound bone; otherwise
    this flap will inevitably dehisce (split). The disadvantages
    of the buccal advancement flap are a relatively shallow sulcus
    (groove between the jaw and the cheek) postoperatively and
    the risk of flap dehiscence because it is a single-layer
    closure and must be closed over bone (Figure 2).</p>

<h2>Buccal fat pad flap</h2>
<p>This procedure is approached using a similar incision to the
    buccal advancement flap (see above), but when the periosteum
    is incised, an artery clip is passed into the submucosa to
    identify the buccal fat pad (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-fistula-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The buccal pad of fat, a vascularised
        mobilizable entity which can be repositioned as a flap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is an axial flap that lends itself beautifully to the closure
    of oroantral fistulae. It can be used as an isolated flap
    where the vascularised fat fills the defect and is held in
    place with vertical mattress sutures (common, interrupted
    suture technique designed for minimal tension and scarring),
    thus allowing the raised buccal flap to be repositioned in
    the buccal sulcus to maintain depth (Figure 4).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Top left: Technique for buccal
        fat pad flaps â€“ relieving incisions; top right: subperiosteal
        flap elevated; middle left: buccal fat pad exposed by
        periosteal incision; middle right: fat pad delivered
        and used as sole reconstruction to maintain sulcus depth;
        bottom: postoperative healing showing preserved cheeks
        and sulcus.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A combination of buccal fat pad and buccal advancement flap is
    probably the most effective way to close an oroantral fistula.
    The advantage of the technique is that the vascularised buccal
    fat pad fills the defect below the buccal advancement flap.
    This provides mucosal closure and thereby creates a double-layered
    vascularised closure that virtually has no chance of dehiscence
    and breakdown. The technique is illustrated in Figure 5.</p>

        technique; top right: flap elevated; bottom left: flap
        mobilised; bottom right: fat pad inset, mucosa partially
        advanced.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Palatal finger flap</h2>
<p>This is the third technique for closing chronic or persisting
    oroantral fistulae where buccal advancement flaps or fat
    pad flaps are not appropriate. The palatal finger flap is
    based on the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">greater palatine artery</a>.
    The palatal flap is a very stiff and immobile flap, although
    it provides extremely robust, well-vascularised tissue. It
    is possible to isolate the palatal flap completely on the
    greater palatine vessels, which makes it much easier to suture
    into position but is more demanding surgically. The disadvantages
    of the palatal flap are that it leaves a raw defect on the
    palate that requires some kind of palate coverage because
    it is extremely painful for weeks afterward and it is difficult
    to rotate the flap into position. This flap is one of those
    procedures that look very straightforward when it is drawn
    on a diagram but in reality, because of the stiffness of
    the palate, is actually extremely awkward to achieve. For
    the palatal finger flap (indeed all these flaps) postoperatively
    nose blowing needs to be avoided. A nasal <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/decongestant">decongestant</a>    is useful, as well as a course of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial medication</a>.</p>
