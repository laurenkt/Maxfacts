<h1 id="effects-of-radiation-on-matter">Effects of radiation on matter</h1>
<p>Visible light is a type of electromagnetic radiation, but it
    only makes up a small part of the full spectrum (Figure 1).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-Xray-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The spectrum of electromagnetic
        radiation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation in the X-ray range is called ionising
    radiation. Its energy is high enough for it to be able to
    break chemical bonds in molecules and create ions as it passes
    through matter. X-rays interact with matter by two main processes,
    the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering (Figure 2).
    Ionisation of atoms can occur by an X-ray donating all of
    its energy to an electron in the photoelectric effect, or
    by donating some of its energy to an electron and resulting
    in a lower energy X-ray photon via Compton scattering.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-Xray-level3-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The photoelectric effect and Compton
        scattering.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The photoelectric effect was discovered toward the end of the
    19<sup>th</sup> century – experiments showed electrons could
    be emitted off a metallic surface when illuminated with light.
    In 1905, Albert Einstein explained the effect by considering
    electromagnetic radiation as discrete particles of energy
    he called photons. The energy of electromagnetic radiation
    is linked to its frequency (Figure 1) and if a photon of
    a high enough frequency strikes an electron within an atom,
    this photon will either be absorbed or scattered. The photoelectron
    effect concerns the absorption of photons. When a sufficient
    amount of energy is absorbed, the electron will ‘escape’
    and ionise the atom.</p>
<p>The physicist Arthur Holly Compton suggested another effect.
    If Einstein’s predictions were true, if a photon’s energy
    was not enough to induce the photoelectric effect when colliding
    with an electron, the photon should recoil and be left with
    reduced energy. This is the principle behind the second process
    – Compton scattering. It results in a decrease in energy
    (decrease in frequency) of the photon and ionisation of the
    atom by emitting an electron from a peripheral electron shell.</p>
<p>Prolonged exposure to X-ray radiation destroys living biological
    tissue. Electromagnetic radiation with the energy of, or
    higher than, that of UV radiation can break chemical bonds
    between atoms in biological molecules, ionise atoms and create
    radicals. The mechanisms of how this damage occurs is exploited
    in <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles/detailed">radiotherapy</a>    with the intent to damage and destroy malignancies.</p>
<p>The biological effect of X-ray radiation, called the ‘biologically
    equivalent dose’ is often quoted in units called Sieverts
    (Sv). A Sv is the product of the absorbed dose of radiation
    and a numerical factor called the ‘relative biological effectiveness’.
    Relative biological effectiveness is an empirical ratio of
    effectiveness of one type of ionising radiation relative
    to another. The absorbed radiation dose is measured in Gray
    (Gy) and is defined as the absorption of one Joule of radiation
    energy per kilogram of matter (energy per unit mass; Joule
    (J) and kilogram (kg) are the ‘proper’ physical units).</p>
<p>The dosage depends on exposure time and the intensity of the
    beam. For all diagnostic purposes of X-ray radiation, the
    dosage is reduced as much as possible. For example, the exposure
    time is reduced by using highly sensitive detectors. The
    radiation intensity is reduced by filtering out the low-energy
    component of the X-ray spectrum using aluminium filters.
    This part of the X-ray radiation does not contribute to the
    image, so provides a dose of radiation without diagnostic
    information and, hence might just as well be blocked and
    filtered out.  </p>
<p>The dosage levels of X-ray radiation vary widely in different
    applications (summarised in Table 1). The most widely used
    in maxillofacial diagnostic imaging in order of increasing
    dosage are: plain film X-ray radiographs, panoramic radiographs
    (OPG/DPT), cone beam computer tomographs (CBCT), and computed
    tomographs (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>).
    Even higher dosages of radiation are used in <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>.</p>

<h1 id="creating-images-with-x-rays">Creating images with X-rays</h1>
<p>The processes by which X-ray radiation interacts with matter
    reduces the intensity of the ‘beam’ (attenuate the radiation)
    as it propagates through the body. Attenuation depends on
    the atomic number and density of the material that the X-ray
    interacts with. The more electrons an atom has, the more
    X-ray radiation it can absorb in either the photoelectric
    effect or Compton scattering (the ratio between the two effects
    depends on the frequency of the radiation). For example,
    bone is denser than soft tissue and contains atoms of higher
    atomic number and hence more electrons (calcium and phosphorus
    in bone, oxygen and carbon in soft tissue). Bone absorbs
    significantly more X-ray radiation energy than the equivalent
    thickness of soft tissue.</p>
<p>Images created with X-rays exploit the way different structures
    absorb X-rays in different amounts. After passing through
    the body onto a detector, fully exposed areas appear black,
    whereas areas which have absorbed X-rays appear in shades
    of grey up to white, based on how much radiation was absorbed.
    The variation in darkness between areas of the image is the
    contrast. Bones readily absorb X-rays and appear white upon
    the detector producing a high contrast. Conversely, X-rays
    which travel easily through less dense tissue such as fat
    and muscle, appear as shades of grey. Different types of
    soft tissues can be differentiated better by using <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">contrast agents</a>.
    Contrast agents in diagnostic X-ray imaging exploit the strong
    absorbance of X-ray radiation by heavy elements.</p>
<p>X-ray imaging typically makes use of collimators. These are devices
    that filter the X-rays so that only those travelling parallel
    to a specific direction can pass through the object being
    investigated. Collimators are a means to control the exposure
    to radiation. Collimators are rated by how many times they
    can reduce undesired radiation by half. Collimators are also
    used in <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/application/more-info">radiotherapy treatments</a>    (intensity-modulated radiotherapy, IMRT) to shape the beam
    of radiation and, in consequence the irradiated area.</p>
<p>Photographic film is not sensitive to X-ray radiation but the
    results of an X-ray investigation need to be ‘translated’
    to some form of visible image. Photographic film is a polymeric
    material, coated with an emulsion of silver salts (silver
    halides, typically silver chloride or bromide) suspended
    in gelatin. Silver salts are photosensitive and react to
    produce metallic silver when light falls onto them. Unmodified
    silver halides are sensitive only to the blue part of the
    visible-light spectrum. A long exposure time would be required
    for a well-exposed image on a photographic film when using
    X-ray radiation. However, increasing the exposure times increases
    the X-ray dosage, which is undesirable. Instead, an intensifying
    screen is used. The photographic film is positioned between
    two layers of a luminescent material (such as calcium tungstate)
    which readily absorbs X-rays. Calcium tungstate then emits
    blue light, which is detected by the photographic film (Figure
    3).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-Xray-level3-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The efficiency of detection is
        improved when the photographic film is positioned between
        two layers of a luminescent material.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Modern X-ray images are often generated digitally with electronic
    detectors rather than using film. Digital recording of X-ray
    images has some advantages as to some extent the digital
    images can be processed for optimised contrast without increasing
    the radiation dose. A so-called image intensifier is used
    to record the image. X-rays strike a luminescent material
    which then emits light. The light then propagates to a photocathode
    which releases electrons. The electrons are focussed in a
    vacuum with electrodes and accelerate across a vacuum tube
    before they strike a fluorescent screen. This produces a
    visible image.</p>
<h1 id="some-technical-details-of-various-x-ray-imaging-approaches">Some technical details of various X-ray imaging approaches</h1>
<p><strong>Plain film X-ray</strong> (Figure 4) gives a two-dimensional,
    superimposed view of a three-dimensional object. Plain film
    X-ray images are the simplest medical images and are the
    X-ray modality with the lowest exposure to X-ray radiation
    dosage.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-Xray-level3-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> X-rays that are not absorbed by
        passing through the object are recorded on an X-ray sensitive
        film. An anti-scatter grid improves contrast by blocking
        scattered radiation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A beam of X-rays is passed through the part of the body to be
    scanned and recorded on an X-ray sensitive film or photographic
    film positioned between two luminescent layers. This simple
    procedure provides fast, high-resolution images of small
    volumes and is relatively inexpensive. The average examination
    for plain film X-ray images takes only a few seconds – only
    one snapshot image is taken.</p>
<p>Typical applications of plain film X-ray imaging include the
    identification of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">ectopic teeth</a>    together with dental panoramic radiographs (DPT; see below);
    thousands of such images are being taken daily for this purpose.
    Other applications of intraoral plain films include the identification
    of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">caries</a> (bitewing
    radiographs), <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">periapical pathology (at the apex of a tooth root)</a>,
    or to assess the viability of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implants</a>.
    Intraoral placement of a plain film X-ray holder may be impossible
    for somebody suffering from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>    or may be difficult in some other circumstances (such as
    in the presence of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">mucositis or other mouth ulcers</a>).
    In such cases, the recording of a panoramic radiograph (DPT)
    may be preferable (see below).</p>
<p>In the recording of a <strong>panoramic radiograph</strong> (DPT),
    the X-ray tube and collimator/receptor rotate around the
    head in opposite directions. During panoramic image acquisition
    a continuously moving centre of rotation allows optimum image
    resolution across the jaw arch (Figure 5).  The method yields
    a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object and
    enables the imaging of a larger area than plain film X-ray
    imaging does. The X-ray radiation dosage for the recording
    of a DPT is still relatively low.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-Xray-level3-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Working principle of the recording
        of a panoramic radiograph (DPT).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In a DPT, only structures along the dental arch are in focus.
    The whole process of recoding takes about one minute, with
    a variable radiation exposure depending on the movement of
    the radiation source around the head.  </p>
<p>It is difficult to determine the precise location of objects
    in a DPT. Such panoramic radiographs are susceptible to errors
    such as distortion and double images. Image distortion is
    inherent to the technique because the vertical and horizontal
    zooms both vary differently across the image. Due the upward
    angle of the X-ray beam, structures closer to the X-ray source
    are projected higher on the image receptor than structures
    further away. Ghost images originate from objects present
    between the X-ray source and the centre of rotation (Figure
    5). Ghost images appear on opposite sides of the image and
    higher on the image than their actual anatomical location.
    As they are not within the focal range of the X-ray beam,
    they appear blurred and magnified. Double images of objects
    can also occur if the object is posterior to the centre of
    rotation and so is struck by the beam twice. Despite all
    these apparent flaws, DPT is an incredibly commonly used
    clinical investigation in maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>The incorrect apparent location of an object in a panoramic radiograph,
    inherent to the creation of a two-dimensional image of a
    three-dimensional object is called the parallax effect. It
    can be overcome by exploiting the rules of geometry and projection;
    by simply recording a second radiograph from a different
    angle. The two images combined allow the determination of
    the correct position of an object (Figure 6). This approach
    has been widely used in orthodontic applications; it is capable
    of delivering reliable geometric information with a minimum
    exposure to X-ray radiation (which is highly desirable, given
    that orthodontic treatments are predominantly a domain of
    treating children and teenagers).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-Xray-level3-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Working around the parallax effect.
        Left: how geometry helps to determine the correct position
        from two different viewing angles. Right: a practical
        example using a DPT (top right) and plain film (bottom
        right) upper anterior occlusal view to localise ectopic
        canines. The view of the crowns of both canines moves
        with the X-ray tube toward the apex of the incisors (front
        teeth), thus revealing them to be palatally placed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Dental panoramic radiographs are a workhorse in maxillofacial
    and oral surgery, with inferior image resolution to plain
    film radiographs. They are used routinely in <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth">dentoalveolar surgery</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">traumatology</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">oncology</a> and there are
    those who would argue that they have a role in the complete
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination/detailed">examination</a>    of any new maxillofacial patient as DPTs can uncover pathology
    simply and cheaply that may not be revealed by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">clinical examination</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Cone beam computed tomography</strong> (CBCT) uses a
    divergent X-ray beam which is formed into a cone shape. A
    region of interest is scanned by this conically shaped X-ray
    beam around the vertical axis of the head (see Figure 7).
    It is a relative newcomer on the scene of oral and maxillofacial
    X-ray imaging tools.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-Xray-level3-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Working principle of cone beam
        computed tomography, CBCT.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The tube and detector perform a 180 ° or 360 ° rotation round
    the region of interest. During rotation, the scan can obtain
    up to 600 distinct images. This data can be converted into
    arrays of data ‘slices’ which can be viewed in defined planes.
    The CBCT volume consists of a three-dimensional array of
    such image elements.</p>
<p>A CBCT scan carries a significantly higher exposure to X-ray
    radiation than does the recording of a DPT. A <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scan</a>    (which carries an even higher X-ray radiation exposure) delivers
    a proper three-dimensional mapping of a three-dimensional
    object; a CBCT scan does not really achieve this faithful
    mapping. There are movement artefacts and image noise. Different
    areas appear in different grey scales, depending on their
    relative position rather than different densities. This inconsistent
    display of attenuation is difficult to detect and/or interpret
    in the projection images. Detailed information on soft tissues
    is not obtained. In addition, so-called ring artefacts (centred
    on the axis of rotation) critically depend on the careful
    calibration of the scanner.</p>
<p>CBCT is much advertised as the new ‘gold standard’ of X-ray imaging.
    Accordingly, its use has been reported in many application
    areas, including <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implant planning</a>    (so far the predominant application), <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies">craniofacial deformities</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts of the jaws</a>, <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal">periodontal disease</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">endodontics</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">osteitis (dry socket)</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">osteomyelitis</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteonecrosis</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">temporomandibular joint (jaw joint) problems</a>    and several other pathologies. For none of these applications,
    improved treatment outcomes have been reported when compared
    with the use of more traditional (two-dimensional) DPT and
    plain film imaging approaches. This raises the question of
    balance between potential benefits of having ‘a little more
    than two-dimensional’ information and a five- to seven-fold
    increased X-ray radiation exposure in comparison with DPT-based
    X-ray methods.</p>
<p>This is currently being debated and a final answer as to the
    merits of (or genuine indications for) CBCT is not clear.
    However, the following two points are clear:</p>
<ul>
    <li>where artefacts are not acceptable (such as for surgical
        planning, for production of cutting templates and similar
        in <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>),
        <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scanning</a> remains
        the gold standard for obtaining a faithful three-dimensional
        representation;</li>
    <li>where artefacts are not acceptable and where hard and/or
        soft tissue imaging is required, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>        remains the gold standard imaging approach with much
        better image quality for soft tissues.</li>
