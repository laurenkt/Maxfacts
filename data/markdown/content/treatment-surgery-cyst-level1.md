<p>After diagnosis, the treatment options for the  majority of cysts
    are straightforward.</p>
<p>In some cases a ‘do nothing, wait and see’ policy is appropriate.
    In the majority of cases, however, surgical removal of a
    cyst is necessary and the treatment of choice. The precise
    strategy and choice of operative technique depends on the
    location, nature and size of the lesion, as well as on the
    patient (age, fitness, preference – if there are different
    options). Some of these operations may be carried out under
    local anaesthesia, others require <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>,
    mainly depending on the size and location of the cyst.</p>
<p>The preferred surgical treatment of a cyst is likely to be its
    complete removal. Where this is not desirable or possible
    (for example, for large cysts where complete removal would
    cause extensive local damage, or for patients who are unfit
    for more extensive surgery), less radical surgical treatment
    approaches exist.</p>
<p>Only few cysts of the jaws require more aggressive forms of removal
    which may include resection of bone in contact with the lining
    of the cyst.</p>
