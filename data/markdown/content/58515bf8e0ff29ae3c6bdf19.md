<p>The story of suitable treatment options for a fistula is quickly
    told. Once the cause of the fistula is identified, steps
    need to be taken to eliminate the underlying cause. This
    could be <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">local infection</a>    or an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>,
    retained or fractured root fragments from a dental extraction,
    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">necrotic bone</a>.
    Without eliminating the underlying cause treatment of a fistula
    on its own will not be successful, the fistula will recur.</p>
<p>Apart from this general requirement of eradicating the underlying
    cause (where possible), the fistula simply needs to be surgically
    removed. It is essential that the entire tract of the fistula
    is excised before the resulting wound is closed. The exact
    method for closure of the wound depends on site and extent
    of the fistula (Figure 1).</p>
