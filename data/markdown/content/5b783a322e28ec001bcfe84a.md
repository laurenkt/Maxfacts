<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the cheekbones
    include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Relapse from the place of <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">reduction</a>;
        while much less common now, a malreduction should be
        repositioned surgically before the bone unites (otherwise
        resulting in a malunion).</li>
    <li>Malunion necessitates an osteotomy (cutting) of the broken
        bone and moving it to a position which best simulates
        the original position of that cheekbone, then fixing
        it in the new position with small titanium plates and
        screws.</li>
    <li>Compression of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">infraorbital nerve</a>        (the sensory nerve that innervates the upper lip, parts
        of the nose and the lower eyelid, one on each side of
        the face) can result in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">neuropathic pain</a>.
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Analgesics</a>        may help, but sometimes surgical removal of the impinging
        bone is necessary. There is a real risk of further damage
        to the nerve by surgery. Alternatives include <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">cryoanalgesia</a>        to the nerve.</li>
    <li>Double vision and epiphora (tearing) can be a problem if
        the orbital floors or walls (eye socket) are involved;
        see treatment of <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/orbit">postoperative problems affecting the orbit</a>.</li>
    <li>Epistaxis (nosebleed) is dealt with by <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy</a>        or nasal packing.</li>
    <li>Scars that will affect the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/cheeks">cheek</a>        may require <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">scar revision</a>.</li>
    <li>Ectropion and entropion, when scarring pulls the lower eyelid
        out (ectropion) or in (entropion), is essentially treated
        by scar revision, with or without <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin or mucosal grafting</a>.</li>
    <li>Incorrect positioning of bone(s), leading to an over-prominent
        or sunken cheekbone can be corrected by post-traumatic
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">osteotomy</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>        over the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/cheeks">cheek</a>        is usually managed medically (with a range of potential
        medications) if troublesome.</li>
</ul>
