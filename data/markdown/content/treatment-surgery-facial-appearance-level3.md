<h1 id="rhytidectomy-">Rhytidectomy  </h1>
<p>Rhytidectomy (face lift) involves an incision as
    illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The incision line
        for rhytidectomy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The incision is made preauricularly (in front of the
    ear), underneath the lobule of the ear, over the
    posterior (back) aspect of the pinna (external part of
    the ear) and extended into the hairline at a right angle
    to it. A plane is formed in the subcutaneous (under the
    skin) fat (Figure 2) and extensive skin flaps are
    raised. These extend to the midline of the neck and to
    the modiolus of the cheek (a set of muscles located to
    the side and slightly above the angle of the mouth).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure2.jpg">

        and undermining of the skin flap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The sagging and ageing of the superficial muscular
    aponeurotic system (SMAS), a subcutaneous tissue layer,
    may be addressed by dissecting out the SMAS layer as
    separate flaps, dissecting it with the skin flaps, or
    not dissecting it but rather hitching it up and suturing
    it to the temporal fascia (a strong fibrous tissue layer
    in front and slightly above the ear) with nonresorbable
    suture. The flaps are pulled upward and backward
    (separate SMAS flaps allow a differential pull) and
    excess skin is excised.</p>
<h1 id="facelift-procedures-for-the-lower-face-and-midface">Facelift procedures for the lower face and midface</h1>
<p>The <strong>standard two-plane lift</strong> involves the
    elevation of a skin flap of variable length from
    preauricular and temporal incisions. After elevation of
    the skin flap, a SMAS flap is elevated, typically from
    below the zygomatic arch (cheek bone), then
    preauricularly, lateral to the anterior (front) border
    of the parotid gland (salivary gland in front of the
    ear), usually extended past the ear lobe and continued
    as a platysmal flap (the platysma is a flat sheet of
    muscle that runs from the collar bone to the angle of
    the jaw). The SMAS flap can be extended medially 3 to 5
    cm, sometimes a little further along the jowls. More
    superiorly it ends before the level of the lateral
    border the zygomaticus major (the ‘smile muscle’, the
    muscle that pulls the angle of the mouth upward).
    SMASectomies and plication of the SMAS and platysma are
    common. The results of this approach are excellent for
    the jowls and the lower face, but they do little to
    restore a more youthful appearance of the midface.</p>
<p>The advocates of the <strong>extended superficial
        musculoaponeurotic system flap</strong> claim that
    by extending the SMAS flap medially well over the
    zygomaticus muscles, longer-term improvement can be
    achieved for the nasolabial fold and consequently the
    appearance of the midface. Although injury to the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">facial
        nerve</a> branches of the zygomaticus muscles is
    unlikely, branches to the upper-lip orbicularis (the
    muscle that closes the mouth) are vulnerable under the
    malar fat pad (beneath the skin and the subcutaneous fat
    layer; see below). The SMAS is often so thin medially
    that postero-superior traction on it accomplishes
    little.</p>
<p>A <strong>two-plane lift with additional mobilisation or
        suspension of the malar fat pad</strong> requires a
    relatively extended skin flap to be elevated to reach
    and mobilise the ptotic (drooping) malar fat pad. It is
    repositioned and suspended with sutures to the temporal
    fascia. Problems are encountered with this method
    because of disruption of suborbicularis planes (near the
    rim of the eye socket and slightly above the ridge of
    the cheek bone) leading to prolonged oedema and possible
    distortion of the lateral canthus (where the upper and
    the lower eye lids meet at the outer corner of the eye).
    This operation has good long-term results but is not
    without risks.</p>
<p>In the <strong>extended supraplatysmal plane skin
        flap</strong>, a long, thick skin flap is elevated
    off the SMAS-platysma complex, thus leaving all the fat
    attached to the skin flap. In practice, this becomes
    difficult medially where the SMAS thins out. All the
    facial retaining ligaments are released and the skin
    flap is elevated. The SMAS and platysma are also
    generally plicated for additional support. Or, if thick
    enough, a SMAS flap or SMASectomy can be performed. The
    malar fat is in theory elevated, attached to the
    underside of the skin flap.</p>
<p>The <strong>deep plane or composite lift</strong> is
    essentially an extended SMAS flap technique but leaving
    the skin attached to the SMAS. This long, thick skin
    muscle flap is closed under tension. The neck flap and
    the face flap do not connect over the mandible, unlike
    in most traditional two-plane lifts. There are real
    risks of complications, including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">facial
        nerve neuropathy</a>, long term skin discolouration,
    an ‘over-operated’ look and lengthy recovery.</p>
<p>The <strong>subperiosteal lift</strong> is primarily
    directed to the midface. In brief, the periosteum (layer
    of dense connective tissue enveloping bones) is elevated
    off the cheek bone. Once it is released inferiorly, the
    periosteal flap with all the overlying upper lip levator
    muscles, SMAS, malar fat pad and skin is repositioned
    more superiorly and posteriorly, thereby bringing the
    malar fat pad into its former position. There are
    variations of the technique (subciliary or intraoral
    incision, usually endoscopic subperiosteal temporal
    lift).</p>
<p>There are several other, simpler face-lift techniques,
    including</p>
<ul>
    <li>Webster lift (shorter skin flap, simple plication),
    </li>
    <li>S-lift (short skin flap, small incision, simple
        plication);</li>
    <li>suspension lift (using sutures made from stretched
        polytetrafluoroethylene fibres);</li>
    <li>minimal access cranial suspension (MACS) lift
        (provides jowl correction);</li>
    <li>minimal preauricular access lift.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-appearance/more-info">further,
        non-surgical procedures</a> to achieve some degree
    of facial rejuvenation.</p>
<h1 id="blepharoplasty-and-related-procedures-">Blepharoplasty and related procedures  </h1>
<p>Blepharoplasty (eye lid correction) deals with sagging or
    puffy eye lids. Bags under the eyes are related to
    problems with fat distribution around the eyes, rather
    than lax skin. The incision for <strong>lower lid
        blepharoplasty</strong> is shown schematically in
    Figure 3.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Schematic of a
        lower lid blepharoplasty incision.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The incision runs just under the lashes and extends out
    laterally in a crow’s foot. A musculocutaneous (skin and
    muscle) flap is raised, revealing the orbital septum (a
    thin but discrete layer between the lining of the
    orbital bone and the eyeball) and underlying fat. There
    are three fat pads: larger central and medial ones, a
    smaller lateral one. Where there is a prominent
    nasojugal groove (a groove in the region between eye lid
    and cheek), the fat is re-draped to fill this groove and
    even out the bagginess of the lower lid. Otherwise, the
    orbital septum may simply require tightening. This is
    achieved by <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">bipolar
        diathermy</a> burns that induce pinpoint areas of
    fibrosis (scarring) and tightening. Fat removal should
    be minimal because excessive fat removal can lead to a
    sunken appearance, which is difficult to correct. Skin
    removal should also be minimal.</p>
<p>In contrast to the lower eye lids, upper eye lid
    bagginess is largely the result of excess skin. Figure 4
    illustrated the incision for <strong>upper lid
        blepharoplasty</strong> for the removal of excess
    skin.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Schematic of an
        upper lid blepharoplasty incision.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Immediately postoperatively the eye lids will not meet,
    but this will settle in about two weeks. In addition to
    skin removal, a small amount of muscle may need to be
    removed. As with the lower eye lids, there may be a
    small amount of fat herniation that may require
    reduction, but there is no lateral fat pad (rather this
    is the lacrimal (tear) gland, and it should be left well
    alone).</p>
<p>In order to address sagging eyebrows, a number of
    different brow lift procedures and incisions are used,
    including</p>
<ul>
    <li>Coronal incision – this incision is made well into
        the hairline (4 to 5 cm) and a strip of scalp is
        excised. This procedure tends to lengthen the
        forehead.</li>
    <li>Pre-trichial incision – this incision is made at the
        hairline, and scalp is excised. This tends to
        shorten the forehead. It can result in an abrupt
        change from skin to hair, thus giving a slightly
        artificial appearance.</li>
    <li>Midforehead incision – the incision is within the
        forehead and is suitable for people with deep
        rhytids. It shortens the forehead, and there will be
        a visible scar that will be red for a year or so.
    </li>
    <li>Direct brow pexy – this simply excises tissue
        directly above the eyebrow. Again, there will be a
        noticeable scar. This procedure is particularly
        indicated for people with damage to the temporal
        branch of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">facial
            nerve</a>.</li>
    <li>Endoscopic brow lift – five small incisions are made
        within the scalp, and subperiosteal dissection is
        carried out endoscopically. The scalp is pulled
        posteriorly and fixed to the skull with screws,
        which are removed after a few weeks. Although it can
        potentially lengthen the forehead, this approach is
        very popular.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="otoplasty-pinnaplasty">Otoplasty (pinnaplasty)</h1>
<p>There are various techniques for the correction of
    prominent ears, depending on the underlying cause.</p>
<p>In the technique of anterior scoring, skin is excised in
    the posterior pinna after assessing the amount of
    reduction required. The skin excision is purely to
    remove the excess that will be left at the end of the
    procedure. The cartilage is incised and dissected off
    the anterior skin. The cartilage is then scored parallel
    to the long axis of the pinna, and further scores may be
    made at right angles to these. This procedure allows the
    intact posterior elastic cartilage to pull the pinna
    back, thus creating a rounded natural antihelix (the
    thick vertical ridge of the ear). The pinna will be
    lying at a more natural angle and can be sutured into
    position.</p>
<p>An alternative is to thin the cartilage posteriorly with
    a burr and suture the cartilage to the mastoid process
    (an area behind the ear). This has the advantage of
    avoiding dissecting the skin over the anterior surface
    of the cartilage, but it works against the natural logic
    of using the elastic fibres.</p>
<p>An alternative, well established technique is direct
    suturing using permanent mattress sutures (traditionally
    white silk) to recreate the antihelix. An excessive
    concho-occipital angle (the angle between the bone
    behind the ear and the cup of the ear) can be reduced by
    excision of the appropriate of cartilage from a
    posterior approach (Figure 5, Figure 6).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Left: prominent
        ears preoperatively; the increased conchal angle

</figure>
<h1 id="rhinoplasty">Rhinoplasty</h1>
<p>Vast arrays of incisions may be used in performing a
    rhinoplasty. However, there are essentially two
    approaches – open or closed. The closed approach remains
    the most popular method. It involves intranasal
    incisions either through the alar cartilages, or between
    the alar and the upper quadrilateral cartilages with a
    connecting preseptal transfixion incision (incision
    through both sides of the septum; Figure 7).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Transfixion
        incision that connects the intranasal intra- or
        inter-cartilaginous incisions for access to the
        nasal skeleton.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An open rhinoplasty leaves a small scar across the
    columella, whereas a closed rhinoplasty does not. The
    bony surgery usually involves removal of a dorsal hump
    (if present), thus leaving an ‘open roof’. Lateral
    osteotomies from the piriform aperture (opening in the
    skull, creating the nasal aperture) along the junction
    of the nasal bones to the maxilla allow this to be
    closed to leave a narrower dorsum with a smooth,
    straight profile (Figure 8).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Left:
        preoperative view of a dorsal hump; right:
        postoperative result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The alar cartilages may require attention if the nasal
    tip needs to be addressed. This usually involves either
    trimming of the lower lateral cartilages or suturing the
    medial crura (structure extending below the septum and
    forming the columella and part of the nose tip).</p>
<p>Options for <strong>increasing tip projection</strong>
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>tip sutures – this procedure involves the removal of
        any intervening interdomal tissue and suturing the
        middle crura to one another;</li>
    <li>columellar strut – this places a cartilage strut
        into a pocket between the medial crura of the lower
        lateral cartilages to provide a supporting
        structure;</li>
    <li>tip graft – when even further increased projection
        is needed, an onlay graft can be sutured over the
        tip.</li>
</ul>
<p>Options for <strong>decreasing tip projection</strong>
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>medial or middle crural release – this procedure is
        used for minimal deformity: release of ligaments and
        placement of sutures between the middle crura and
        caudal septum sets back the lower lateral cartilage
        complex to a certain degree;</li>
    <li>cephalic trim – this procedure is the excision of a
        portion of the cephalic margin of the lower lateral
        cartilage and thus disrupts the support of the nasal
        tip. A medial crural-septal suture may be used to
        secure the tip in a more posterior position.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increasing tip rotation</strong> by a small
    amount may be achieved by simple excision of the
    cephalic border of the lower lateral cartilages.</p>
<p><strong>Decreasing tip rotation</strong> involves
    harvesting a septal extension graft of cartilage from
    either the septum or the rib, and fixed to both the
    dorsal septum and medial crura. This will serve to push
    the tip inferiorly and derotate the nose. The tip may be
    reduced or a submucous resection of the cartilaginous
    septum may be carried out. Straightening a deviated
    cartilaginous septum is difficult.</p>
<p>Where tissue is required to be added rather than removed,
    a graft from the pinna or septum can be used, for
    example to augment the dorsum or the projection of the
    nasal tip. Much time is spent discussing the best form
    of postoperative dressings and support, but the actual
    tissue manipulation is the crucial component of these
    interventions (Figure 9).</p>

        dressing after dorsal hump reduction and minimal tip
        work.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="genioplasty">Genioplasty</h1>
<p>Genioplasty procedures use very similar principles to
    those of <a href="/treatment-surgery-jaw-disproprtion-level3">orthognathic
        procedures</a> (Figure 10).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> X-ray lateral
        images of a prominent chin; preoperative (left) and
        postoperative (right) views.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chin is approached from an intraoral incision that
    exposes and protects the mental nerves. Bone cuts are
    made horizontally to retain the lingual muscle
    attachments. The chin is reduced by excising a middle
    portion of bone and inset to preserve the aesthetics of
    the cortical chin shape. It can be advanced by sliding
    forward. It is internally fixed using miniplates (Figure
    11). Small asymmetries can be corrected in this way.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Internal
        fixation of a genioplasty.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Augmentation genioplasty uses implants, either made from
    synthetic materials or a bone graft taken from the hip.
    The implant can be inserted by a skin incision under the
    chin (which is invisible from a front view) which is
    preferable for inert non-biological implants which have
    a lower inherent resistance to infection. Iliac crest
    grafts or sliding advancement genioplasties are far more
    common and a number of specific intra-oral miniplates
    have been devised to aid this surgery which also has a
    role in managing obstructive sleep apneoa. Almost
    inevitably, the aesthetic results using somebody’s own
    bone are superior to those achieved by using synthetic
    materials.</p>
<p>Genioplasty approaches, are used to correct other facial
    contours as well. If facial contours appear excessive
    because of underlying bone, this can in part be
    corrected by osteotomies (Figure 12).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> Supraorbital
        ridge reduction with osteotomies.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is particularly important in those areas where
    reduction of the outer cortical shape may result in a
    distorted contour (Figure 13).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level3-figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Bone
        resculpting.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It should be borne in mind that the postoperative
    appearance is unpredictable. There is not a 1 : 1
    relationship between bone removed and reduction in final
    soft tissue contour. Similarly, where there appears to
    be a soft tissue deficit, alloplastic onlays may be
    employed for augmentation (Figure 14).</p>
