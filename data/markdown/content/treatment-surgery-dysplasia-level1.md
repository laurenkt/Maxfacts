<p>When recalling our brief discussions of the challenges in the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">diagnosis of (and prognosis for) lesions of the oral mucosa</a>    (lining of the mouth), it will not come as a surprise that
    management and treatment of these lesions is controversial.
    The only generally agreed action is a close observation and
    review scheme for these lesions when they have an appearance
    described as moderate or severe. To do otherwise would place
    an intolerable and counterproductive burden on patients and
    healthcare resources.</p>
<p>Neither clinical appearance of dysplastic lesions nor histophathology
    findings after an <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">incisional (or excisional) biopsy</a>    have much predictive power as to a likely development of
    such mucosal lesions (it could be anything from spontaneous
    resolution to rapid development of an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oral malignancy</a>,
    and anything in between (such as simply no progression)).
    Many molecular biomarkers have been suggested, alongside
    other metrics (such as the severity of the dysplasia, and/or
    size and location of the lesion) in the hope to have a predictive
    and non-invasive tool available at the diagnostic stage.
    Genomics, to date, have also failed to perform a useful predictive
    function. For the time being, there is no such predictive
    tool.</p>
<p>This leaves patients and clinicians with a dilemma as far as
    treatment options are concerned, a challenge for all involved:
    where should the line be drawn, given that the majority of
    oral mucosal lesions are benign and will never progress to
    a malignant disease and that recurrence of many of these
    lesions seems to be independent of surgical removal.</p>
<p>Aggressive surgical removal of any such lesions is advocated
    by some clinicians. Other clinicians take a more conservative
    view and advocate more of a ‘wait and watch carefully’ policy.
    Any policy will include biopsies as an instrument to exclude
    malignancies. <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">Laser excision</a>    has been proposed as a slightly less invasive approach, given
    the good healing tendencies of laser wounds. Reducing the
    morbidity from multiple, repeated biopsies and/or excisions
    of these lesions, possibly over many years, is undoubtedly
    an important consideration.</p>
<p>Apart from the debated surgical excision strategies for dysplastic
    oral mucosal lesions, non-surgical treatments include application
    of topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/steroids">corticosteroids</a>,
    a variety of ineffective mouth rinses, topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/retinoid">retinoids</a>    and even topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bleomycin">bleomycin</a>.
    There is no convincing evidence of the efficacy of any of
    these ‘chemopreventive’ measures.</p>
