<p>While cell death (necrosis) can affect both <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">soft</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">hard tissues</a>,
    sometimes both simultaneously, the treatment options for
    hard and soft tissue necroses differ slightly.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we describe treatment for <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue">hard tissue necrosis</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/soft-tissue">soft tissue necrosis</a>    separately.</p>
