<p>When thinking about cutting tools for surgery, the first picture
    to appear in most people’s minds is a knife with a small,
    sharp blade; a scalpel. Scalpels and other mechanical tools
    (for example, scissors) to cut and/or remove tissue are certainly
    the most widely used tools in the trade. However, they are
    not the only option to cut and/or remove tissue.</p>
<p>Various alternative methods to cut and/or remove tissue can be
    summarised under a unifying view of exploiting extreme temperatures
    for such purposes. These alternative methods rely on the
    effects of very high and very low temperatures on living
    tissues.</p>
<p><strong>Very high temperatures</strong> for a surgical cutting
    device can be produced by different physical effects. The
    most common techniques are provided by the properties of
    (several different types of) lasers, or by high-frequency
    electrical current (surgical diathermy). There are subtle
    differences between these high (diathermy) to very high (laser
    tools) temperature devices and their strengths and disadvantages,
    and as compared with cutting with a scalpel. High temperature
    cutting devices may have strategic advantages where it is
    important to reduce or stop bleeding. They may also increase
    the risk of wound <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Very low temperatures</strong> exploit the unique properties
    of this ubiquitous and unique liquid, water. Suitable freezing
    techniques of tissues (known as cryotherapy), usually employing
    liquid nitrogen (liquid N<sub>2</sub> temperature is -196°C)
    as the refrigerant, freeze water molecules in tissue cells.
    Water has a physical anomaly in that it expands when turning
    into ice. Therefore, this freezing process is harmful to
    cells which subsequently die because of damage by ice crystals,
    and then get removed by the body’s healing processes. Thus,
    application of very low temperatures indirectly leads to
    tissue removal. Although tissue can be removed by extreme
    cold it cannot be cut in the same way as a scalpel, diathermy
    or laser beam cut tissue.</p>
<p>Next we examine <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">the working of the various high and low temperature devices</a>    and how they interact with biological tissues, before we
    consider the conditions where and how these techniques are
    best <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">used in clinical practice</a>    in maxillofacial surgery.</p>
