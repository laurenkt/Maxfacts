<h1 id="general-aspects">General aspects</h1>
<p>All of the soft tissue sarcomas listed (see below) can occur
    anywhere in the body, including the head and neck region.
    Soft tissue sarcomas are rare but aggressive malignancies
    with an overall incidence of 5 per 100.000 per year and accounting
    for less than 1 % of all malignancies in the head and neck
    region. There are some notable exceptions and special considerations
    regarding this heterogeneous group (there are more than 50
    histological subtypes known) of uncommon soft tissue malignancies
    as far as the maxillofacial region is concerned.</p>
<p>Soft tissue sarcomas display a considerable variation in their
    histology and clinical behaviour, similar to the situation
    observed for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">bone sarcomas</a>    (also rare as primary malignancies). The aetiology of soft
    tissue sarcomas is largely unknown but previous exposure
    to high-energy radiation, <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>,
    is a well-known long-term risk for the development of secondary
    malignancies later in life, including soft (and hard) tissue
    sarcomas. While it is reasonable to assume that most sarcoma
    cases arise sporadically, some rare forms of genetic predisposition
    (for example, Gardner’s syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome),
    exposure to certain chemicals (urethane, polycyclic hydrocarbons,
    some polyethylene derivatives), immunosuppression and some
    virus infections (for example, HIV infection) are all thought
    to be associated with increased risk for soft tissue sarcomas.
    It is not uncommon for soft tissue sarcomas to be diagnosed
    only after <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>    and the effects of these, for example in lungs or bones,
    caused a visit to a clinician.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that it is difficult to obtain useful
    (that is, large enough and comparable) data sets for meaningful
    statistical analysis for all rare diseases. Soft tissue sarcomas
    of the maxillofacial region are no exception to this fundamental
    rule. Even in the absence of extensive statistical analyses
    (and general guidelines based on such data) it is not difficult
    to see that a main challenge in the <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/other">treatment of maxillofacial soft tissue sarcomas</a>    often is to realise wide resection margins in the first-line
    surgical treatment of these lesions, given the anatomic and
    functional constraints in this region.</p>
<h1 id="liposarcoma">Liposarcoma</h1>
<p>Only 4 % of liposarcomas are found in the head and neck region,
    yet liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in
    the maxillofacial region. The neck is the most common site,
    the lesion usually presents as a soft lump. The second most
    common site is the scalp. Liposarcomas in the head and neck
    region (see Figure 1) are thought to be significantly more
    often low-grade (less aggressive) malignancies than liposarcomas
    of other parts of the body. Simple excision and reconstruction
    has a reasonable high success rate.</p>

<h1 id="leiomyosarcoma">Leiomyosarcoma</h1>
<p>Leiomyosarcoma, originating from smooth muscle cells, is overall
    the most common soft tissue sarcoma. This type of smooth
    muscle tissue forms the walls of, for example, the intestines
    and the womb. Most commonly the stomach is affected by this
    type of sarcoma. Leiomyosarcoma is a rare tumour in the head
    and neck region but has been reported to occur in the nasal
    sinuses and the skull base. The low incidence of leiomyosarcoma
    in the head and neck region has been explained by the paucity
    of smooth muscle in this anatomic region.</p>
<h1 id="rhabdomyosarcoma">Rhabdomyosarcoma</h1>
<p>Rhabdomyosarcoma develops from striated muscle cells. It mostly
    affects children and adolescents, but is also seen in adults.
    Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in
    children and its most common location is in the maxillofacial
    region (near the eye, nasal sinuses, throat, palate and near
    the spine in the neck).</p>
<p>There are two main types of rhabdomyosarcoma, plus some rare
    variants. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma mainly affects young
    children but is the most common type at all ages. This variant
    is called ‘embryonal’ because of the characteristic appearance
    of the malignant cells, which resemble the developing muscle
    cells of a 6 to 8 week old embryo. The second main type,
    alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma occurs at all ages equally and
    accounts for approximately 20 to 30 % of rhabdomyosarcoma
    cases. It affects most commonly the head and neck region
    but also the extremities (see Figure 2). There does not seem
    to be a genetic predisposition for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.</p>

</figure>
<h1 id="angiosarcoma">Angiosarcoma</h1>
<p>Angiosarcoma is the umbrella term for malignancies of the endothelium
    cell lines that form the wall of blood and lymphatic vessels
    (haemangiosarcoma refers to a malignancy of the blood vessels,
    lymphangiosarcoma refers to malignancies of the lymphatic
    vessels). Angiosarcomas tend to be aggressive malignancies
    with a propensity for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastasis</a>.</p>
<p>Angiosarcomas affect men and women equally. They mostly affect
    the elderly and are very rarely seen in children. Most angiosarcoma
    cases belong to the category of cutaneous angiosarcoma (angiosarcoma
    of the skin), mostly in areas chronically exposed to UV light.
    Cutaneous angiosarcoma is usually found on the face or scalp.</p>
<p>Some angiosarcomas are found in deeper tissues (subcutaneous
    angiosarcoma). Cutaneous angiosarcomas usually show signs
    of bleeding and tissue <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>.</p>
<h1 id="kaposi-sarcoma">Kaposi sarcoma</h1>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma is a rare vascular malignancy that develops from
    the endothelial cells, similar to other forms of angiosarcoma
    (see above). In most cases it affects the blood vessels of
    the skin, mostly the upper and lower extremities and face,
    but also the mucosa of the head and neck region (most commonly
    the oral cavity, and there the palate, but has also been
    reported in the pharynx, larynx and tonsils).</p>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma can be caused by the human herpes virus 8 (HHV8)
    and in particular affects HIV infected people (nearly all
    HIV-positive people are also infected by HHV8) with high
    virus loads (such as AIDS; nowadays less common in the industrialised
    parts of the world). HHV8 infection is also strongly suspected
    to be related to the occurrence of some forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">lymphoma</a>    and Castleman’s disease (a systemic condition affecting the
    lymph nodes). Kaposi sarcoma is also found in people who
    are HHV8- and HIV-negative. Some types of Kaposi sarcoma
    seem to have some genetic predispositions, and most infected
    with HHV8 (common viral infection) never develop Kaposi sarcoma.</p>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma of the skin commonly starts with small, flat,
    slow-growing discoloured skin lesions. Kaposi lesions can
    also affect lymph nodes and other body organs (lungs and
    liver in particular). If the lymph nodes are affected, Kaposi
    sarcoma may cause painful lymphoedema (swellings caused by
    fluid retention).</p>
<h1 id="neurofibrosarcoma-and-malignant-schwannoma">Neurofibrosarcoma and malignant Schwannoma</h1>
<p>The peripheral nerves are covered by a particular type of protective
    tissue that is made up of a cell type closely related to
    fatty tissue cells (Schwann cells (named after the physiologist
    T. Schwann), also called neurolemmocytes). This protective
    and insulating myelin sheath wrapped around the peripheral
    nerve fibres has multiple roles. It improves electrical conduction
    in neural signal transfer and aids general maintenance of
    healthy nerve tissue, and communication between body / muscle
    cells and neural impulses.</p>
<p>All peripheral nerves in the body can develop tumours of the
    protective sheath tissue, including the cranial nerves (in
    the skull), sympathetic chain (part of the autonomous nerve
    system, not under voluntary control; along the neck), brachial
    (nerve system running from lower front of neck to chest)
    or cervical plexus (serving the sensation and motion of the
    side and back of neck, head and scalp) in the head and neck
    region. One of the cranial nerves, the vagus nerve, is most
    commonly affected.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about the anatomy of the nerve
        system in the head and neck region, this information
        is in our section about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">anatomy of the head and neck</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The majority of these neurogenic tumours (neurofibroma, Schwannoma)
    are slow-growing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed">benign tumours</a>.
    Approximately 25 to 40 % of these are found in the head and
    neck region. If possible / on balance, these tumours should
    be <a href="/treatment/surgery/benign-lump/more-info">surgically removed</a>:
    there is a small but significant risk of benign Schwannomas
    for malignant transformation (see Figure 3 and Figure 4).</p>
<p>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, neurofibrosarcoma
    and malignant Schwannomas, are rare aggressive malignancies
    with potential to form systemic <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases/more-info">metastases</a>    <i>via</i> haematogenous (blood flow) spread. Given the rarity
    of these tumours (fewer than 100 cases diagnosed each year
    in the UK), their aetiology is poorly understood.</p>
