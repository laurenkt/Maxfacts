<p>The group of antiresorptive medications are widely used in the
    long-term treatment of osteoporosis (brittle bones) and in
    the management of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">bone metastases</a>.</p>
<p>The working principle of these medications is to interfere with
    the normal physiological <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">bone remodelling process</a>.
    This remodelling process can be viewed as composed of a resorption
    phase (where old/spent bone tissue is broken down and removed)
    and a formation phase (where new bone tissue is laid down).
    Antiresorptive medications reduce the activity levels in
    the resorption phase such that overall less bone tissue is
    resorbed and thus can help to strengthen bone.</p>
<p>There are two main groups of such antiresorptive medications:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/denusomab">denusomab</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is unlikely that antiresorptive medications will be prescribed
    in a maxillofacial clinic. However, in a maxillofacial clinic
    the consequences of unwanted effects of these medications
    will be seen. Owing to the widespread treatment with antiresorptive
    medications, these drugs have become the most common cause
    of necrosis of the jaws, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">MRONJ</a>    (medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws).</p>
<aside>
    <p>The normal bone remodelling processes and the mechanisms
        underlying the development of MRONJ (and other forms
        of osteonecrosis of the jaws) are discussed on our
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">detailed page about hard tissue necrosis</a>.</p>
