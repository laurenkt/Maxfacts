<p>Dental prostheses are worn by millions of people. The loss of
    tooth starts an immediate destructive process in the upper
    and lower jaw in which the alveolar bone (the bone whose
    function it is to retain teeth and support their function)
    gradually resorbs. Over years, unless the functional loads
    of teeth can be recreated (for example, by <a href="/treatment-restorative-dentistry-implants-level1">dental implants</a>),
    this process will continue life long until the jaw comes
    to resemble an adult-size version of the foetal jaws.</p>
<p>Preprosthetic surgery is the name given to surgical procedures
    which attempt to make the hard and soft tissues of the jaws
    more receptive to provision of fixed or removable dental
    prosthesis.</p>
<p>In the time before successful dental implants became possible,
    these were designed mainly to make acrylic dentures sit more
    comfortably and retentively on the rounded alveolar bone
    covered by firm gingivae (gums) by removing disrupting hard
    and soft tissue elements, or artificially increasing the
    area for the denture to sit on (sulcus deepening).</p>
<p>In modern times, the surgery is more about improving that area
    of the jaws to accept implant-borne prosthesis.</p>
