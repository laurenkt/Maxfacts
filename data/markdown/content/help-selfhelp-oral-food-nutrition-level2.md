<p>Apart from the sensual and social pleasures of eating &amp; drinking,
    there is also a more technical component to consider. We
    need to understand the nutritional input required to keep
    our bodies properly nourished. Consideration of these nutrition
    aspects is an inaccurate ‘science’ and a healthy dose of
    common sense is probably the best approach to this topic.
    In part this is due to the fact that much of the food and
    drink narrative is completely entangled with cultures and
    traditions, with everybody having some over-familiarity with
    certain aspects of eating &amp; drinking (which drives some
    non-scientific approaches) as well as increasing influences
    of industrial food production in Western countries from the
    mid to late 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are a few key facts concerning nutrition, which
    we outline below. Beyond these key facts, common sense strongly
    suggests the following: in situations where eating is a serious,
    possibly long-term challenge, none of the common dietary
    recommendations, such as ‘five-a-day’, apply easily. Special
    circumstances require special approaches and that includes
    nutrition and diet for a good number of oral &amp; maxillofacial
    patients.</p>
<p>The one recommendation that probably applies to most maxillofacial
    patients with longstanding difficulties in eating enough
    by mouth is; do not panic about common wisdom and recommendations
    about a ‘healthy diet’. Malnourishment (or rather: undernourishment;
    obesity is also a form of malnourishment) is definitely not
    healthy. A suitably adapted high-protein, high-calories diet,
    made up by good-quality foods, can go a long way in preventing
    undernourishment while minimising the efforts with eating
    and, hopefully, maximising the pleasures of eating. Any missing
    components from such an adapted diet can be supplemented
    as and when needed. Furthermore, be aware that difficulties
    with eating and swallowing are highly individual and vary
    enormously, even for people suffering from otherwise very
    similar conditions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, individual solutions for such problems is what is
    needed! The best way to find optimal individual solutions,
    including changes over time, is to cook at home, from scratch.
    It is the best way not only to <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">adjust textures, taste and temperatures</a>    as needed / preferred, it also gives complete control over
    the quality of ingredients and the composition of food –
    and it tends to be the least expensive route to a healthy,
    adapted diet.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you would like to look for some kitchen inspiration, our
        <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes/browse">searchable recipe database</a>        has many tried and tested recipes on offer, with suitable
        examples for all kinds of eating difficulties.</p>
</aside>
<p>First things first, let us have a look at the basic principles
    of feeding the body, and work out from these facts how one
    can optimise nutrition obtained from limited amounts / volume
    / type of oral food intake.</p>
<p>One, easy way to keep an eye on one’s nutrition requirements
    is to keep a <a href="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-nutrition-level2-diary-printable.pdf">food diary</a>.
    This is a completely non-judgemental way to identify any
    potential deficiencies, and to learn about what does and
    what does not work.</p>
<h1 id="the-components-of-our-diets">The components of our diets</h1>
<p>In terms of nutrition the foods we eat are made up of macronutrients
    (proteins, carbohydrates, fats (and <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol</a>))
    and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and other trace elements)
    and the ubiquitous elixir of life, water.</p>
<h2>Water</h2>
<p>Staying hydrated and drinking enough for many with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing problems</a>    is probably the biggest challenge. When safely swallowing
    liquids is the main problem, a variety of methods to thicken
    liquids, or turn them into jellies can make a major difference.
    Thickened liquids, or jellies all count as liquid intake.
    All that has happened is that problematic liquids have been
    modified such that they are easier and safer to swallow (see
    our <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes/browse">recipe data base</a>    for tasty inspiration and read about <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">texture modifying of many foods</a>).
    In particular gelatin-based jellies make excellent ‘liquids
    in disguise’, these jellies preserve taste and are easy to
    swallow because of the particular melting properties of gelatin-based
    jellies. In short: there should be safe &amp; tasty ways
    to stay hydrated for almost everybody.</p>
<h2>Macronutrients</h2>
<p>Macronutrients are the source of energy and essential nutrients
    from our foods. Different foods are made up by different
    compositions of macronutrients. For example, pasta is essentially
    pure carbohydrates. Milk is a mixture of proteins, carbohydrates
    and fats in the form of an emulsion (an oil-in-water emulsion)
    whereas cream is a mixture of the same three types of macronutrients
    but with a higher relative fat content than milk (a polemic
    comment about skimmed milk: there is very little point in
    using skimmed milk in order to cut down on consumption of
    saturated fats – if that is the aim, spreading a <i>little</i>    bit less butter on the toast is more effective; do the numbers!
    A slightly less polemic comment about milk, in favour of
    full milk: the ever so slightly higher fat content of full
    milk can well make a big difference in terms of lubricating
    some other foods, when that is a consideration (as is the
    case for many people with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry mouth)</a>).
    Beer is a dilute solution of alcohol, some carbohydrates
    and proteins in water, so effective that the German Winter
    Olympic team used an alcohol-free specialist Bavarian beer
    ‘Weissbier’ as a nutritional supplement (because this type
    of beer contains yeast).</p>
<p>This gives a first hint about the usefulness of variety in any
    diet: a balanced, varied diet will automatically provide
    ‘something of everything’. Some traditional, often century-old
    local food traditions happen to provide automatically a good
    balance of some macronutrients. Good examples of such useful
    traditional combinations are rice &amp; red beans, or rice
    &amp; soybeans.</p>
<p>The different types of macronutrients provide different <strong>amounts of energy</strong>    per consumed unit. A traditional (but non-scientific) unit
    to quantify the energy content of foods is kcal/g (the scientific
    measure for units of energy content of food materials is
    kJ/g):</p>
<ul>
    <li>carbohydrates: ca. 3.8 kcal/g (ca. 16 kJ/g)</li>
    <li>proteins: ca. 4.0 kcal/g (ca. 17 kJ/g)</li>
    <li>fats: ca. 9.0 kcal/g (ca. 37 kJ/g)</li>
    <li>alcohol: ca. 7.0 kcal/g (ca. 29 kJ/g).</li>
</ul>
<p>This brief overview, for the moment concentrating only on the
    energy content of the four types of macronutrients, suggests
    the following. In terms of calories per unit eaten, fats
    are the most energy-dense food (with alcohol a close runner
    up, although we usually do not consume undiluted alcohol).
    Proteins and carbohydrates are similar in energy density.
    Trying to follow a low-fat diet while being confronted with
    oral food-intake problems is obviously not a good idea, for
    a number of reasons (not just with respect to energy intake
    but also with respect to <a href="//help-selfhelp-oral-food-lubrication-level2">lubrication of other foods</a>).
    A glass of beer or wine (unless there are other reasons to
    stay away from alcohol completely) not only is useful for
    many people to improve their appetite and/or make a meal
    more enjoyable, it may be a simple way to add energy content
    to the diet (or, at the other extreme: if losing weight is
    wanted / needed, reducing alcohol intake is a good choice).
    An empirical overall average energy intake of 2000 kcal per
    day for women and 2500 kcal per day for men is a standard
    recommendation, assuming ‘standard activity levels’ (whatever
    that may be…).</p>
<p>If the intake of macronutrients was only concerned with their
    respective energy density, a fat-only diet would obviously
    provide the most energy for the least amount of food eaten.
    Matters are not quite so simple because the various macronutrients
    have further and varied body-nourishing functions. In addition,
    not all food categories are equally easy / difficult / impossible
    to handle for many maxillofacial patients who find eating
    a challenge. So, let us next examine the additional nutritional
    roles of the four categories of macronutrients.</p>
<p><strong>Alcohol</strong> is a special case amongst the four categories
    of macronutrients in that it only provides energy / calories
    but no further significant nutritional benefits. However,
    we should not dismiss its indirect benefit as a potential
    appetiser (or even mood enhancer) for special circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Proteins</strong> are essential food components for a
    number of reasons, not just to provide energy. It is essential
    to continuously provide proteins in the diet as the body’s
    metabolism uses up proteins from dietary supplies quickly
    in its maintenance of function and structure, including the
    body’s own protein components (muscles and skin for structural
    proteins, for example). In terms of function, proteins are
    involved in essentially all cellular metabolic processes.</p>
<p>Chemically proteins are all composed of modular building blocks,
    amino acids (Figure 1), connected by so-called peptide bonds.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-nutrition-level2-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Essential (red) and non-essential
        (black) amino acids; the bottom section displays a general
        view of connected amino acids (peptide bond) as the building
        principle of proteins.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some amino acids are synthesised in the body; these are called
    non-essential amino acids (but this does <i>not</i> mean
    that they are not important in metabolism). Some amino acids
    are not synthesised by the human metabolism and thus need
    to be provided by dietary sources. The needs of amino acids
    supplied by dietary sources differ slightly for children
    and adults.</p>
<p>Sources of proteins with particularly suitable overall amino
    acid composition to cover all needs are found in animal-derived
    foods; meat, eggs, fish and dairy products. Proteins from
    plant-derived foods usually have a less broad composition
    in terms of amino acids. That can be compensated for by a
    pick &amp; mix approach, by combining several foods (for
    example, wheat-based foods (bread) and lentils together have
    a complete amino acid profile). Particularly useful plant-based
    protein sources are all pulses (including soy bean products)
    and cereals. For any vegetarian, vegan or otherwise mostly
    plant-based diet, the diversity of daily foods is particularly
    important for a complete and balanced protein supply. Protein
    deficiency in the diet should be avoided as far as possible
    as this type of diet deficiency leads rapidly to muscle wasting,
    vulnerability to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    and poor wound healing.</p>
<p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> typically are a significant contributor
    to the overall energy intake from food in a typical Western
    diet, although the relative amounts vary hugely across diets
    in different regions of the world. In some parts of the world
    80 to 85 % of the dietary energy intake stems from carbohydrates,
    whereas in some other parts of the world it is as low as
    30 %. Carbohydrate fractions tend to be high where the local
    diet is predominantly plant based (by and large it is plant
    materials that provide dietary carbohydrates). Usually diet
    patterns low in carbohydrates are high in fat, and low-fat
    diets tend to have a larger carbohydrate component (including
    sugar).</p>
<p>This degree of variability of composition of diets across the
    world is good to remember as many maxillofacial patients
    find traditional Western carbohydrate-rich foods difficult
    to eat (think of stodgy, sticky mashed potatoes, or similar).
    Furthermore, the simplest of all carbohydrates, ordinary
    sugar (glucose) is on the to-be-avoided list of many maxillofacial
    patients for a number of reasons. This could be a short term
    issue (for example, to give <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">oral wounds or ulcers</a>    time to heal and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">minimise infection risk</a>    by avoiding sugar), or it could be a long term issue in particular
    for those suffering from dry mouth, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>    and/or difficulties opening the mouth, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>    where high sugar contents of food and drinks exacerbate
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay problems</a>. In short, there is no need to
        worry if the carbohydrate component of the diet is reduced
        and in part replaced by proteins and fat; this does not
        prevent a varied and healthy diet overall as long as
        an appropriate level of energy intake is achieved.  </p>
<p>The simplest, smallest carbohydrate molecule is glucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>    (ordinary sugar). Glucose molecules can form dimeric and
    linear or branched polymeric molecules of variable size,
    perhaps better known in everyday life as ‘starches’. Figure
    2 gives a schematic view.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-nutrition-level2-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Monomeric, dimeric and polymeric
        arrangements of carbohydrate molecules; for each of these
        categories there are numerous members of the class of
        chemicals.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Oal intake of sugar (often hidden in considerable amounts in
    processed and ‘low fat’ foods and declared in misleading
    terms on the packaging) is problematic in a range of oral
    and maxillofacial conditions. Remember carbohydrates as such
    are not all problematic and serve important roles in digestion
    and energy supply to the body. Polymeric carbohydrates (usually
    referred to as polysaccharides) can be subdivided into two
    groups: those that are soluble and are broken down into small
    units in the digestive process, and those that cannot be
    digested.</p>
<p>Soluble polysaccharides, after being broken down in the digestive
    system into smaller fragments, are absorbed in the small
    intestines and provide energy to the body by ending up as
    glucose in the blood stream. Different sources of soluble
    polysaccharides release blood glucose at different rates;
    this is called the glycaemic response. If it takes longer
    to break down a particular polysaccharide, we feel satisfied
    for longer and with a slow and steady glucose supply to the
    blood stream, there are no insulin spikes (some pricey specialist
    energy gels used in endurance sports highlight this point
    as the marketing driver, emphasising that slow release carbohydrates
    help to support gluconeogenesis over long events). In the
    endurance events of everyday life, for example pulses and
    oats provide polysaccharides with a slow glycaemic response,
    potatoes or pasta are carbohydrates with an intermediate
    rate of glucose release. Any sugary foods or drinks and white
    bread provide glucose instantly, but with no long-lasting
    effect – one feels hungry soon again.</p>
<p>Insoluble polysaccharides are not digested and are commonly referred
    to as ‘fibres’. Despite not being digested, they have a very
    important role in the digestive system. Most insoluble polysaccharides
    belong to the chemical class of cellulose (see Figure 2).
    Cellulose derivatives can take up large quantities of water
    and swell in the process. This is what happens with insoluble
    polysaccharides in the colon, the swelling of these fibres
    encourages peristalsis (forward-pushing motion of the intestines)
    by bulking up the processed food in the intestines and reduces
    constipation. Some fruit, many vegetables and in particular
    whole grains provide variable amounts of insoluble polysaccharides.
    In some diets that are feasible as oral food intake for some
    maxillofacial patients, insoluble fibre may have to be added
    as a supplement. A low-fibre diet or insufficient fluid intake
    are not the only possible reasons for constipation. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">Opioid analgesics</a>    also cause constipation. Often alongside opioids a synthetic
    form of insoluble fibres is prescribed (containing gels that
    swell in the intestines, and bulk and soften stools just
    as insoluble fibres in the diet do; this supplement only
    works with sufficient fluid intake).</p>
<p>Table 1 gives a brief summary of some common sources of soluble
    and insoluble fibres.</p>

<p><strong>Fats</strong> in our diet all belong to the class of
    chemicals called lipids, that is chemical compounds that
    are insoluble in, and immiscible with, water. These properties
    require fats to form complexes with some specialised transport
    proteins in order to be carried around the body by blood
    without separating from this water-based transport medium.
    A number of different lipids play a role as dietary fats,
    including triglycerides, phospholipids and sterols (such
    as cholesterol) (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-nutrition-level2-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Schematic view of some important
        types of lipids in dietary fats.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main dietary role of fats is their provision of energy. In
    addition, fats in the diet are necessary to ensure the uptake
    of essential nutrients by acting as a carrier for nutrients
    that are not soluble in water. For example, vitamins A, D,
    E and K (see below) are only soluble in fat. Dietary fats
    also act as the carrier phase for many chemicals that are
    responsible for the taste of foods, in addition to acting
    as an important lubricant for foods. Some dietary fats are
    important for being metabolically converted into <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/steroids">steroid hormones</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a>,
    and some lipids that are crucial for the functioning of cell
    membranes. Cholesterol is an important dietary component
    that is only found naturally in animal-derived food. It is
    important in the digestive process (being a precursor of
    bile acids) as well as in its role as precursor of several
    hormones and vitamin D. Some closely related plant-derived
    sterols (phytosterols) exist as well.</p>
<h2>Micronutrients</h2>
<p>Micronutrients do not significantly contribute to the energy
    intake from food, they are only needed in tiny quantities.
    However, the right amounts and composition of vitamins, minerals
    and other trace elements are essential components to keep
    the body alive and healthy. As a rule of thumb, it can be
    assumed that a varied diet that includes a generous range
    of different foods on a regular basis will provide all necessary
    micronutrients. Many of the sometimes costly, dietary supplements
    are usually not necessary. If there are any proven and persistent
    deficiencies of micronutrients, these do need to be replenished;
    vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency being a typical example
    which cannot be resolved be dietary manipulation.</p>
<p>Vitamins are organic compounds that are necessary in small quantities
    to maintain a wide range of essential body functions. Some
    vitamins are water-soluble, others are fat-soluble (A, E,
    D, K); some vitamins can be stored by the body while others
    are needed to be constantly supplied.</p>
<p>Minerals and electrolytes (including calcium, iron, zinc, copper,
    iodine, selenium, magnesium, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum,
    sodium and potassium ions, as well as fluoride, chloride
    and phosphates) have many different roles in metabolism and
    are provided by many different dietary sources. Everybody
    probably remembers from school or historic movies the massive
    health effects of poor diet and resulting nutritional deficiencies
    in times long gone (in the developed world), such as severe
    vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) or rickets (bone disorder associated
    with severe vitamin D deficiency). No such serious effects
    from poor diet are likely to be seen nowadays, at least not
    in the Western world. However, more subtle effects of micronutrient
    deficiencies do play a role in health. For example, lack
    of iron or zinc ions, or low levels of a number of B vitamins
    (thiamine, B<sub>1</sub>, riboflavin B<sub>2</sub>, folate,
    B<sub>9</sub>; cobalamin, B<sub>12</sub>) have all been associated
    with otherwise idiopathic (unknown cause) <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">burning mouth syndrome</a>.</p>
