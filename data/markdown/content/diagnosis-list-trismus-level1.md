<p>Difficulties with opening the mouth (trismus; also known as jaw
    hypomobility) are common. These problems range from minor
    disturbances all the way to complete inability to open the
    mouth. Trismus can be a temporary problem (of varying severity)
    on a short time scale, but can also last for a considerable
    period of time, or may be permanent.</p>
<p>Trismus can be a symptom or a consequence of disease, or may
    arise as a consequence of treatments (in particular <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    or some <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgical interventions</a>).
    Depending on the severity and duration of difficulties with
    opening the mouth, a number of potentially serious additional
    health issues can arise. Severe and lasting forms of trismus
    not only have a negative impact on quality of life in general,
    there can be issues with <a href="/help/oral-food">malnutrition</a>    from eating problems, <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    can be difficult and lack of it can lead to problems with
    gum disease and dental decay. Dental treatment in these circumstances
    can be challenging, in some cases even impossible. Severe
    trismus also affects <a href="/help/salt">speech</a> negatively
    and altogether can be a cause of long term <a href="/help/mental-health">mental health issues</a>.
    It is therefore important for those at risk to make any reasonable
    attempt to prevent trismus from developing mental health
    issues in the first place.</p>
<p>Trismus can be caused (or made more likely to develop) by several
    different conditions. These include infections, trauma, surgical
    treatment, dental treatment, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">joint disorders</a>,
    radiotherapy, some drugs, congenital conditions and some
    other rare disorders.</p>
