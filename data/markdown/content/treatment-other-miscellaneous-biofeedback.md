<p>Biofeedback is a term that vaguely places a role of
    measuring some general physiological quantity say,
    electrical conductivity of skin, as a proxy for some
    other specific condition that is in need of attention
    and improvement, and where the improvement and training
    strategies may benefit from monitoring and, well –
    feedback while working at it. Attention here essentially
    refers to some kind of adaptation, self-help, learning
    and re-learning procedures that could be either physical
    or psychological/behavioural in nature. Practitioners of
    such methods claim that there are positive and enhancing
    feedback loops that can be exploited in behavioural
    medicine (a strange term, if not outright patronising;
    the general area of such treatment schemes is also
    sometimes referred to as ‘psychophysiology’) to achieve
    better outcomes for mostly chronic conditions.</p>
<p>Common monitoring modalities include</p>
<ul>
    <li>a non-invasive form of electromyography, EMG
        (placing electrodes on skin to measure electrical
        activity of muscle tissue);</li>
    <li>measurement of electrodermal activity, EDA
        (measuring the electrical conductivity of the skin
        surfaces which reflects the activity of sweat glands
        (think lie detector…));</li>
    <li>measurement of skin temperature;</li>
    <li>a non-invasive method to map the electrical activity
        of the brain (an electroencephalogram, EEG).</li>
</ul>
<p>For some feedback loops, the measured data are converted
    to some visual or audible representation so that they
    can be integrated into a training scheme. Such training
    schemes are basically conditioning exercises for the
    functioning of the autonomic nervous system, to develop
    conditional reflexes. Pavlov’s dogs come to mind: these
    hungry dogs were trained to salivate merely at a
    particular audible trigger signal that previously was
    associated with food being made available.</p>
<p>Biofeedback approaches are being widely used. For
    example, in <a href="/help/mental-health/detailed">counselling for
        anxiety</a>, EMG or EDA feedback is used to provide
    an impression of tension or relaxation. In physiotherapy
    for mobility rehabilitation after a stroke, EMG feedback
    has been used as an adjunct in attempts to activate
    remaining neuron – muscle junctions. Biofeedback
    approaches of some description have been reported for
    conditions as diverse as fibromyalgia (a chronic pain
    syndrome), different forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>, sleep
    bruxism (grinding teeth), some <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint/more-info">temporomandibular
        (jaw) joint problems</a>, many forms of incontinence
    or chronic constipation, many forms of neck and (lower)
    back pain, chronic pain in multiple sclerosis, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">Bell’s
        palsy</a>, hypertension, to name just a few.</p>
<p>A large number of studies and publications exist about
    the whole topic. However, quantity here should very
    definitely not be equated with quality. There is
    essentially no hard evidence that any of these
    biofeedback procedures as adjuncts to other treatment
    schemes achieve significantly better results, or more
    rapidly or longer lasting results, than that achieved by
    physical or psychological schemes alone. Biofeedback is
    clearly never a suitable stand-alone treatment modality.
    Unfortunately, many publications in the field are
    poor-quality studies and do not provide useful or
    reliable evidence.</p>
<p>One could draw the following conclusion. Biofeedback
    schemes do not have any serious adverse effects (except,
    perhaps, on the wallet), so if somebody subjectively
    finds such approaches helpful, why not use them?
    However, nobody should be under the illusion that these
    approaches offer a magic treatment option for any
    otherwise difficult to treat conditions. And if such
    schemes lead to financial hardship for some say, in the
    course of counselling for anxiety, remember that
    learning to relax does not mandate biofeedback but can
    be achieved by many other, cost-free methods.</p>
