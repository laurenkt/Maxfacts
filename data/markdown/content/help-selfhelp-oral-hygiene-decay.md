<p>Dental caries (tooth decay) is the destruction of the hard tissues
    of the tooth, enamel and dentine in the crown of the tooth,
    cementum and dentine in the root. Its aetiology is bacterial
    in conjunction with dietary sugars and starches. When sugar
    is consumed, bacteria in plaque produce acids lowering the
    pH (increasing the level of acidity) in the mouth lasting
    for up to an hour. During this time, minerals are lost from
    the teeth before the pH returns to normal due to the <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">protective properties of saliva</a>    (salivary buffering). The more frequently sugar is consumed,
    the more frequently the teeth are exposed to acid attack
    and consequently the risk of decay increases, especially
    with frequent sweet snacks between meals.</p>
<p>Prevention is vital and geared towards thorough daily plaque
    removal by brushing and interdental cleaning (we demonstrate
    good brushing techniques in our <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">video material</a>).
    Fluoride is of great benefit whether it is standard fluoride
    toothpaste, high concentration fluoride toothpaste prescribed
    by a doctor or dentist, or in the form of a fluoride varnish
    applied 3 monthly by a dentist or hygienist. Fluoride is
    present in most proprietary toothpastes in the form of either
    sodium fluoride or stannous fluoride. In either form, F<sup>-</sup>    ions easily exchange with OH<sup>-</sup> groups in the material
    making up the main structures of the crown of the tooth,
    hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite is an inorganic material with
    a complicated superstructure (closely related to the materials
    making up bones). Partially fluoridated versions of hydroxyapatite
    tend to be much harder materials than ordinary hydroxyapatites,
    as well as being less soluble at lower pH values (hence the
    reduced susceptibility to tooth decay).</p>
<p>With either of the toothpastes it is important to spit out after
    brushing, but not to rinse. In this way the saliva becomes
    saturated with fluoride and the fluoride ions remain around
    the teeth for much longer. For those who have no problems
    with chewing, chewing xylitol gum after meals may help to
    stimulate saliva and return pH levels to normal more quickly,
    also reducing the risk of dental decay.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that can increase susceptibility
    to dental decay which are common after radiotherapy in the
    head and neck region. Lack of saliva due to severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry mouth)</a>    as a consequence of radiation damage to salivary glands prevents
    the protective properties of saliva to operate in protecting
    teeth, while at the same time the bacterial plaque on hard
    surfaces in the mouth becomes concentrated and much more
    difficult to remove. In addition, any <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">recession of the gums</a>    results in root surfaces being exposed, the outer layer of
    which is cementum, a much softer, more porous structure than
    tooth enamel and very prone to acid attack and decay. After
    radiotherapy where it is essential to avoid dental extractions,
    this can be a serious problem.</p>
<p>Another situation where dental decay can be an issue is severe
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> when people
    still have some or all of their natural teeth. If severely
    impaired mouth-opening is a long-term problem, this can make
    cleaning of the internal surfaces of the teeth very difficult
    if not impossible. A similar problem is often encountered,
    short-term in nature, after trauma or surgery where the teeth
    are wired to prevent movement in an injury site (not very
    common nowadays). Plaque removal is still important, but
    a daily oral hygiene regime will need to be tailored to an
    individualâ€™s specific needs (see our <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">video materials</a>    for some tips and tricks).</p>
<p>In many such circumstances a daily mouthwash can be helpful.
    Chlorhexidine mouthwashes are good at helping to control
    plaque build-up in the mouth where brushing is not viable
    and are generally useful in infection prevention after oral
    surgery. Chlorhexidine mouthwash should not be used immediately
    after brushing teeth as it negates the benefits of fluoride
    toothpastes (some high-concentration fluoride mouthwashes
    can also be of benefit in decay prevention by saturating
    the saliva with fluoride). Some chlorhexidine mouthwash preparations
    stain teeth and tongue in some people. These stains are not
    permanent and are easily removed; there are preparations
    available that do not stain teeth and tongue.</p>
<p>One important aspect about using a mouthwash in general is to
    ensure that it is alcohol free: an alcohol-containing mouthwash
    will further dry out a dry mouth.</p>
