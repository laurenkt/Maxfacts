<p>Once the cause of the fistula is identified, steps need to be
    taken to eliminate the underlying cause. This could be
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">local infection</a> or an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>,
        retained of fractured root fragments from a dental extraction,
        or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">necrotic bone</a>        or congenital. Without eliminating the underlying cause
        treatment of a fistula on its own will not be successful,
        the fistula will recur.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the fistula tract simply needs to be surgically
    excised. It is essential that the entire tract of the fistula
    is excised before the resulting wound is closed at both entrance
    and exit points.</p>
<p>Sutures on the skin will be removed after 6 to 7 days (longer
    can lead to cross-hatching scars), on mucosa (lining of the
    mouth) are often left to dissolve. Discomfort or special
    strategies such as avoiding nose blowing for oro-antral fistulae
    last no longer than a week.</p>
<p>There are rarely any substantial medium- or long-term issues
    other than possible recurrence if the entire tract or actual
    cause of the fistula has not been removed.</p>
