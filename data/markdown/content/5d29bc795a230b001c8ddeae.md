<p>Treatment of malformations affecting the skull and face (and
    by inference the contents of those structures) requires quite
    rare collaboration between different surgical and other medical
    specialties, both simultaneously and logistically over time.</p>
<h1 id="craniosynostosis">Craniosynostosis</h1>
<p>The function of the skull (the cranium) is to protect the delicate
    brain tissue and expand to accommodate it as it grows (which
    it does rapidly in the first few months and years of life).
    When this role becomes counterproductive or dangerous – as
    in when the suture lines fuse and do not allow growth, a
    combination of pressure on the brain (which can be lethal)
    and deformity occurs.</p>
<p>The basis of most of paediatric craniofacial surgery is to release
    these fused sutures by cutting them away and allowing the
    brain and associated structures to grow and develop normally.
    The simplest procedure, a ‘strip craniectomy’ consists of
    simply cutting out the fused suture (most commonly the sagittal
    suture – the cause of scaphocephaly) without any form of
    reconstruction is sometimes performed by neurosurgeons in
    isolation. Most other fused suture resections are accompanied
    by repositioning of the cranial bones and <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    using autologous or resorbable synthetic materials.</p>
<p>Where possible excision of the fused suture matching the deformity
    (Figure 1) takes place before intracranial pressure starts
    to increase:</p>
<ul>
    <li>(posterior) plagiocephaly - excision of the lambdoid suture;</li>
    <li>trigonocephaly - excision of the metopic suture;</li>
    <li>scaphocephaly - excision of the sagittal suture (the most
        common synostosis);</li>
    <li>brachycephaly - excision of the coronal sutures.</li>
</ul>

        skull and its sutures. Top row: normal situation; the
        following rows illustrate the distorted growth resulting
        from some premature suture-fusion scenarios; the prematurely
        fused sutures are indicated in blue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In each case surgery involves peeling back the scalp to expose
    the cranial bones. This is done by an incision across the
    skull known as a coronal flap (Figure 2). In neurosurgical
    circles the incision often follows the hairline. In maxillofacial
    circles, it tends to be further back roughly following the
    coronal suture, and starting and finishing in the crease
    in front of the ear. The area of incision is distended with
    saline in paediatric cases to aid <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">haemostasis</a>,
    and <a href="/treatment-other-medicataion-pain-level3">local anaesthetic</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/adrenaline">adrenaline</a>    solution in adults and older children. Plastic clips known
    as Raney clips are placed on the edges of the incision to
    minimise bleeding as the scalp bleeds profusely.</p>
<p>This exposes the periosteum covered skull and can be extended
    forward and downward to expose the orbital rims and zygomatic
    arches.</p>

<p>The relevant fused sutures are identified and cut out with a
    surgical power tool known as a craniotome, which has a blunt
    deep edge which lies above the dura to protect the brain
    while cutting skull bone.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of sutural fusion the relevant sutures
    are cut out. Reconstructive options range from none and simply
    allowing the expanding brain to direct growth of the surrounding
    skull with the removed bone being replaced by osteogenic
    activity, bone dust, rib grafts, resorbable plates or mesh,
    or surgical repositioning of bone.</p>
<p>Complex craniosynostoses typically occur as part of various craniofacial
    syndromes (see below). These conditions usually require early
    initial interventions such as securing the airway, combined
    with subsequent surgeries later in life. These may consist
    of a range of <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">subcranial osteotomies</a>    and other <a href="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level2">soft-tissue surgical interventions</a>. </p>
<p>In an intermediate phase both orthodontic interventions to encourage
    mid-facial growth using functional and hybrid orthodontic
    appliances, or the process of <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">distraction osteogenesis</a>    can be used both as an alternative to, or a supplemental
    preparation for, orthognathic surgery.</p>
<h1 id="craniofacial-microsomia">Craniofacial microsomia</h1>
<p>This is the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies/detailed">second most common craniofacial anomaly</a>,
    with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 5000 births. Definitive
    treatment may be delayed until growth is complete although
    hybrid orthodontic appliances are often used to encourage
    surrounding soft tissue growth. The degree of anatomical
    and physiological function of the mandibular ramus and
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-joint/detailed">temporomandibular joint</a> is the determining factor for
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/detailed">surgical reconstructive intervention</a>.</p>
<p>A wide spectrum of ear and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">cranial nerve</a>    deformities is found. There may be mild abnormalities of
    the ear, or complete absence of the outer ear. Absence of
    the ear is more often now addressed by <a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">craniofacial implants</a>    and a semi-permanent prosthetic external ear.</p>
<h1 id="positional-malformations">Positional malformations</h1>
<p>It is common for newborns to have a slightly strange head shape
    right after birth. Such minor distortions can arise from
    lack of space in the uterus or from the birth process. This
    all takes care of itself after a short while, usually within
    a year.</p>
<p>Tension or spasm in the sternocleidomastoid muscle (also known
    as torticollis) can create a distortion of the head shape.
    This develops over time, with an appearance similar to plagiocephaly
    or brachycephaly but in the absence of any craniosynostosis.
    This is known as ‘positional moulding’ or ‘deformational
    plagiocephaly/brachycephaly’. Treatment is to address the
    position of the child especially while asleep or to correct
    the torticollis by surgery to excise scar tissue in the distorted
    sternomastoid muscle and lengthen the muscle.</p>
<h1 id="treatment-outlines-for-common-craniofacial-syndromes">Treatment outlines for common craniofacial syndromes</h1>
<p>Isolated sutural synostoses are best treated under 6 months of
    age by strip craniectomy and allowing normal brain growth
    to naturally expand the skull, thus preventing increased
    intracranial pressure and achieving the same skull shape
    as would have been expected in the absence of a craniosynostosis.</p>
<p>In cases where the anterior skull, particularly the naso-frontal
    region is involved, release of the affected suture (for example
    the coronal, which may be unilateral) and fronto-orbital
    remodelling is often recommended. This essentially involves
    removing, reshaping, replacing and retaining (often with
    resorbable plates and screws) the frontal bone.</p>
<h2>Specific syndromic conditions:</h2>
<p><strong>Apert syndrome</strong> with sporadic occurrence at an
    incidence of around 1:100,000 the term ‘common”’ is obviously
    relative. The craniofacial component includes fusion of the
    coronal sutures and fusion of the anterior skull base and
    midface sutures which produces shallow orbits and hypertelorism.
    In addition to the craniofacial features four limb symmetric
    syndactylies of the hands and feet are present. Treatment
    is staged and individualised and should be under the care
    of a multidisciplinary craniofacial team as staged major
    and minor (remembering that no surgical intervention is really
    ‘minor’ to the person it is performed on) operations are
    required to release the coronal sutures to allow safe brain
    development and fronto-facial advancement to protect the
    eyes. Hydrocephalus requiring shunting is present in up to
    10 % and isolated cleft palate is present in 30 %. Hearing
    deficit is more common than in the general population.</p>
<p><strong>Carpenter syndrome</strong> in view of the associated
    congenital heart defects, intellectual challenges, hand and
    skull surgery may be staged. Suture excision and skull reshaping
    depends on the severity of raised intracranial pressure.
    Separation of the middle and index fingers are usually the
    first hand operation carried out.</p>
<p><strong>Crouzon syndrome</strong>, although an autosomal dominant
    inheritance and affecting 1 : 25,000, has  many similarities
    in the sutural fusions and mid-face underdevelopment to Apert
    syndrome (see above) and the concept of staged surgical intervention
    is the same. Use of local cranial bone and a range of synthetics
    have replaced grafts from the ribs and ilium, reducing the
    donor site morbidity of these already long and complex procedures
    on infants.</p>
<p><strong>Muenke syndrome</strong> treatment is essentially similar
    to treatment of the other coronal suture syndromes, with
    the potential addition of a cochlear implant for sensorineural
    hearing loss.</p>
<p><strong>Nager syndrome</strong> sometimes requires a tracheostomy
    for airway support as the initial intervention. <a href="/help/non-oral-food">Percutaneous gastrostomy</a>    may be needed for feeding. Later in childhood distraction
    osteogenesis to correct jaw underdevelopment, ear reconstruction
    or replacement by a <a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">craniofacial implant</a>    and a cochlear implant may be required.</p>
<p><strong>Pfeiffer syndrome</strong> again usually requires coronal
    suture excision coupled with lambdoid and sagittal suture
    excision and subcranial advancement in later life, usually
    using external distraction osteogenesis techniques. Hydrocephalus
    present in type II and III Pfeiffer syndrome is shunted.
    Fusion of the elbow and knee joints requires expert orthopaedic
    input.  </p>
<p>In <strong>Pierre Robin sequence</strong>, the airway is secured
    by whatever means necessary and the baby is nursed in a position
    to promote mandibular growth.</p>
<p><strong>Seathre Chotzen</strong> <strong>syndrome</strong> usually
    requires excision of the involved sutures and skull re-shaping,
    usually early to minimise the effects of raised intracranial
    pressure. The ptosis can be corrected later in life if it
    presents an issue, and hand and foot problems may not require
    surgical intervention as they are often quite mild.</p>
<p>The maxillofacial component of <strong>Stickler syndrome</strong>    is essentially <a href="/treatment/surgery/cleft-lip-palate">cleft lip and palate surgery</a>    and possibly later maxillary <a href="/treatment-surgey-jaw-disproportion-level1">orthognathic surgery</a>,
    but the multiple potential other manifestations mean ophthalmic
    and rheumatology input is essential.</p>
<p>For <strong>Treacher Collins syndrome</strong>, multiple surgeries
    have been common in the past but intervention is best personalised
    to the individual patient. Early tracheostomy is sometimes
    needed because of mandibular retrognathism. Later mandibular
    reconstruction using distraction and/or bone grafting with
    cheekbone augmentation and external ear reconstruction or
    support by <a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">craniofacial prosthesis</a>    is required. <a href="/treatment/surgery/cleft-lip-palate">Cleft palate</a>    (if present) is treated as normal.</p>
