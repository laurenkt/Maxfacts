<p>This section is essentially an overview of the infections which
    present to maxillofacial clinicians. Some are extremely common
    and require very little in the way of specialist input and
    others are rare.</p>
<p>Specific surgical infections such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">cervicofacial abscesses</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">osteomyelitis</a>    are dealt with in the relevant sections.</p>
<aside>
    <p>There is much more information on infectious microorganisms
        and the working of antibiotic drugs in our section on
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">medications to treat infections</a>.</p>

<h1 id="bacterial-infections">Bacterial infections</h1>
<h2>Acute bacterial infections</h2>
<p><strong>Pericoronitis</strong> may just require débridement (removal
    of damaged tissue) of the affected area in uncomplicated
    cases if the tooth is to be retained. Any <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>    should be drained. If there is obvious trauma from an opposing
    tooth that is otherwise non-functional, then removal of this
    tooth may allow resolution of the symptoms. The affected
    tooth can be reviewed and arrangements made for its removal,
    if indicated. If an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial agent</a>    is required, a specific anaerobicidal such as metronidazole
    minimizes the risk of an unwanted <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">candida infection</a>.</p>
<p>Treatment of <strong>alveolar osteitis (dry socket)</strong>    consists of irrigation of the socket and placement of an
    obtundent dressing (blunting pain and inflammation). This
    may be supplemented with metronidazole (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agent</a>)
    200 to 400 mg three times a day for three days to eradicate
    any secondary infection with <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">anaerobic bacteria</a>    that is present. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">Diagnosis of alveolar osteitis</a>    and its <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion/more-info">treatment</a>    are further described in the respective sections about bone
    lesions.</p>
<p>Treatment of <strong>acute periodontal disease</strong> (inflammation
    of soft and hard tissues supporting teeth) must take into
    account the treatment of any underlying condition. Apart
    from this, treatment consists of debriding the relevant area
    and drainage. The important issue is whether this is achieved
    by removal of the tooth, or by retention of the tooth and
    cleaning out associated periodontal pockets.</p>
<p><strong>Necrotising ulcerative gingivitis</strong> acutely mandates
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">adequate analgesia (pain control)</a>    to allow adequate fluid intake and débridement (removal)
    of the affected tissue. Good <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    is essential. This is supplemented by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial therapy</a>,
    metronidazole 200 to 400 mg three times a day is the initial
    drug of choice.</p>
<p>Noma, which is the severe debilitating version of necrotising
    ulcerative gingivitis in malnourished people, especially
    children, presents a chronic problem created by extreme,
    often absolute, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>    resulting from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">destruction of facial tissue</a>    that requires surgical division and <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    with robust vascularised tissue (the <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">submental flap</a>    works well). This is a condition seen in extremely poor countries
    with widespread malnutrition and lack of simple healthcare
    interventions.</p>
<p>The treatment of <strong>dental and dentoalveolar abscesses</strong>    is described on our pages about abscesses:</p>
<aside>
    <p>Diagnosis and treatment of simple, localised abscesses as
        well as severe conditions (such as Ludwig’s angina or
        necrotising fasciitis) are described on our pages about
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess / diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/abscess">abscess / treatment</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The treatment of acute <strong>osteomyelitis</strong>, an inflammation
    of bone of infective origin, is described on our pages about
    bone lesions:</p>
<aside>
    <p>Diagnosis and treatment of osteomyelitis are described on
        our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone lesions / diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion">bone lesions / treatment</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Any <strong>bite wounds</strong> are likely to be inoculated
    with significant numbers of bacteria. Irrigation and debridement
    of a bite wound are therefore mandatory. The choice of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial medication(s)</a> is based on the likely infecting
        organisms. For animal and human bites, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">amoxycillin-clavulinic acid</a>        is the drug of choice. A <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">clarithromycin and metronidazole</a>        combination is an alternative if somebody is allergic
        to penicillin. The tetanus immunisation status needs
        to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The treatment of acute <strong>salivary gland infections</strong>    is described on our pages about salivary gland problems:</p>
<aside>
    <p>Diagnosis and treatment of salivary gland infections are
        described on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems / diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/getting-started">salivary gland problems / treatment</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Treatment of the superficial skin infections <strong>impetigo</strong>    and <strong>erysipelas</strong> consists of anti-staphylococcal
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterials</a>    such as flucloxacillin.</p>
<p>The treatment of <strong>furuncles</strong> and <strong>carbuncles</strong>    may require the drainage of any <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>    present. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">Antistaphylococcal medication</a>    should be prescribed and face hygiene optimised. A combination
    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">chlorhexidine and neomycin</a>    ) or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/mupirocin">mupirocin cream</a>    (a topical antibacterial agent) applied to the nares (nostrils)
    helps reduce staphylococcal carriage. When quiescent, any
    affected <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cyst</a> should
    be excised.</p>
<p><strong>Cat scratch disease</strong> usually does not require
    any specific therapy.</p>
<h2>Chronic bacterial infections</h2>
<p>There are recurrent (especially in children) and <strong>chronic forms of bacterial infections of the salivary glands</strong>;
    these are described on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems / diagnosis</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems / treatment</a>.</p>
<p>There is a wide and bewildering range of <strong>chronic bacterial (and non-bacterial) forms of osteomyelitis</strong>;
    these conditions are described on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone lesions / diagnosis</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion">bone lesions / treatment</a>.</p>
<p>Treatment of <strong>actinomycosis</strong> involves prolonged,
    high-dose <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial medication</a>    . Depending on response this treatment may even need to be
    continued for 12 months. Penicillin is the drug of choice;
    erythromycin or clindamycin are used when somebody is allergic
    to penicillin. If there is significant bone involvement,
    then resection and saucerization of the involved bone are
    required. Older texts and some microbiologists advocate prolonged
    (6 weeks) <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">intravenous administration</a>    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">amoxycillin</a>    . Although this regimen can be achieved in some communities
    with highly developed outreach services, a high-dose oral
    equivalent has regularly been effective.</p>
<p>The treatment of <strong>mycobacterial infections</strong> is
    entirely dependent on the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">infecting microorganism</a>.
    <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> responds to complex chemotherapy
    but atypical mycobacteria rarely do. Chemotherapy for <strong>tuberculosis</strong>    is prolonged and involves optimising host factors and long-term
    combination chemotherapy. Currently used <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">drugs</a>    include isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol.
    Treatment should be carried out by/with infectious disease
    specialists because of the increasing problem with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">drug resistance</a>,
    especially secondary to poor compliance with treatment.</p>
<p>The treatment of <strong>infections with atypical mycobacteria</strong>,
    by contrast, is by excision of the affected gland. Anti-tuberculous
    medications are not particularly helpful, but long-term treatment
    with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">clarithromycin</a>    may improve resolution of non-discharging cervical (neck)
    lymph nodes.  </p>
<p>Penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of <strong>syphilis</strong>.
    Contact tracing may be required. The possibility of other
    sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection, should
    be considered.</p>
<h1 id="viral-infections">Viral infections</h1>
<h2>Acute viral infections</h2>
<p><strong>Mumps</strong> is usually self-limiting; only potential
    complications may require treatment (though not in maxillofacial
    clinic).</p>
<p><strong>Epstein-Barr virus infection</strong> is typically self-limiting
    and there is no need for specific therapy, apart from supportive
    treatment such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesia</a>    and fluid support.</p>
<p><strong>Cytomegalovirus infection</strong> is treated with
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antiviral agents</a>, aciclovir or ganciclovir.</p>
<p>Primary <strong>varicella-zoster infection</strong> gives rise
    to chickenpox. The treatment is symptomatic, with attention
    paid to adequate fluid intake.</p>
<p>Treatment of <strong>herpes simplex</strong> infection typically
    involves systemic and/or topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antiviral agents</a>,
    such as aciclovir or famciclovir. If given early (in the
    first 2 to 3 days), these may shorten the course of the infection.
    Labial (lips) secondary herpes (usually type 1) is commonly
    managed topically, whereas genital herpes (usually type 2)
    is more often managed with systemic aciclovir and is an increasing
    problem as a sexually transmitted disease. There is a crossover
    between the two types of virus and the sites. Supportive
    measures are important, and adequate fluid intake must be
    ensured in young an in debilitated patients.</p>
<h2>Chronic viral infections</h2>
<p>Treatment of <strong>herpes zoster infection</strong> is with
    systemic aciclovir, 500 mg five times a day for five days.</p>
<p>Other chronic viral infections (different types of <strong>hepatitis, HIV</strong>)
    may be of relevance with regard to some oral or maxillofacial
    surgical interventions, but a maxillofacial clinic is not
    the place for treatment of these conditions.</p>
<h1 id="fungal-infections">Fungal infections</h1>
<p>Treatment of <strong>candidiasis</strong> (mostly caused by <i>candida albicans</i>)
    must include dealing with any underlying factors (for example,
    optimising control of diabetes, stopping smoking). When the
    <i>candida</i> infection is associated with steroid inhalers,
    consideration should be given to the use of a spacer.
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">Dental hygiene</a> must be maintained at a high level.
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">Antifungal therapy</a> may be <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">topical or systemic</a>.
            The decision to use systemic antifungal agents will
            be based on the severity and duration of symptoms,
            in addition to consideration of underlying systemic
            disease.</p>
<p>‘Azole antifungals’ are the mainstay of systemic therapy, with
    fluconazole the best tolerated (50 to 100 mg daily for ten
    days to three weeks). Miconazole is used in gel (mouth) and
    cream (angular cheilitis) form as the topical agent of choice.
    Combining the two agents in recalcitrant cases may help because
    fluconazole-resistant (and itraconazole-resistant) cases
    of candida infections have emerged (such as infections with
    the less common candida strains, for example <i>candida dublensii</i>).
    Voriconazole is an expensive reserve.</p>
