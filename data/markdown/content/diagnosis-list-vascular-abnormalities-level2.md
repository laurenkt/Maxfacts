<p>Below we summarise common signs and symptoms of the various vascular
    abnormalities, haemangiomata and vascular malformations.
    These lesions can occur everywhere in the body but the majority
    are located in the head &amp; neck region, especially haemangioma.
    Vascular abnormalities are congenital malformations which
    in the majority of cases are sporadic (occur spontaneously);
    the occurrence of vascular abnormalities as an inherited
    condition, or as part of an inherited syndrome, is very rare.</p>
<p>Our discussion is focussed on vascular abnormalities in the maxillofacial
    region. We follow the generally accepted classification of
    these malformations, which subdivides the lesions into vascular
    tumours (including haemangioma and pyogenic granuloma) and
    vascular malformations (of the blood and lymphatic systems).
    It is important to arrive at a precise diagnosis, as the
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">treatment schemes</a>    differ for the different types of vascular abnormalities.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the pathogenesis (origin
        and developmental characteristics) of these vascular
        abnormalities, this information is on our <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">detailed page about the diagnosis of vascular abnormalities</a>.</p>

<h1 id="haemangioma">Haemangioma</h1>
<p>These benign vascular tumours are made up of rapidly proliferating
    endothelial cells (lining of blood vessels) and, in consequence,
    lead to malfunctioning sections of blood vessels. A superficial,
    visible lesion on the skin may only be part of a more extended
    lesion, reaching into deeper tissue layers. When the lesion
    has well-defined boundaries, it is called a focal haemangioma.
    Some haemangiomata lack such boundaries and consist of multiple,
    interconnected lesions (segmental haemangioma). Segmental
    haemangioma often is distributed over the region of the
    <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">trigeminal nerve</a> (one of the cranial nerves) and extends
        to deeper layers of the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">parotid gland</a>        (one of the major salivary glands) and other deep fascial
        planes in the head and neck. Such segmental haemangioma
        often has a beard-like appearance and may involve the
        airway.</p>
<p>Haemangiomata are further subdivided into infantile haemangiomata
    and congenital haemangiomata.</p>
<p><strong>Infantile haemangiomata</strong> are common. They may
    not be noticeable at birth but appear as small but rapidly
    growing lesions soon after birth. This rapid proliferation
    phase typically lasts for one to two years and is followed
    by a phase of involution (shrinkage) of the lesion. The most
    common appearance is a bright red, textured lesion on the
    skin but haemangioma may also occur in the mucosa and in
    deeper tissues. If haemangioma does not affect the skin but
    only deeper tissue layers, a typical bluish skin discoloration
    is commonly observed (Figure 1). Sometimes more than one
    lesion is found, with the liver being the most common location
    outside the head &amp; neck region. Most infantile haemangiomata
    are uncomplicated, need no further interventions and can
    be left alone until they resolve.</p>

        in a 6 months old child.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>About 10 % of infantile haemangiomata are more complicated, mostly
    because of their location, especially when the airway, oral
    cavity or the eye / eyelid are involved. In all these cases
    important functionalities (breathing, swallowing, sight)
    may be impacted by the growing lesion. These lesions require
    careful early investigations by imaging methods (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>    and/or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">MRI</a>) as
    well as continued monitoring. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">Ultrasound Doppler imaging</a>    for the inspection of flow usually shows the lesion as a
    mass with a high-flow characteristic. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">Contrast-enhanced MRI investigations</a>    provide information about precise location and extent of
    the lesion(s), <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">X-ray CT</a>    imaging only very rarely has a role in the diagnosis of haemangioma.</p>
<p>In most of the more complicated cases, some form of <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">intervention</a>    will be required. When interventions are needed, this will
    usually be considered during the proliferation phase in order
    to prevent future functional impairment and/or to minimise
    disfigurement.</p>
<p>For example, haemangioma in the subglottic area (the region between
    the vocal cords and the windpipe) may require long-term surgical
    securing of the airway (tracheostomy) and later <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>.
    Complications may also arise for otherwise uncomplicated
    haemangiomata when rapid growth leads to ulceration, bleeding
    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">necrosis of the surrounding skin and tissues</a>;
    in particular when the lower lip or ear are afflicted.</p>
<p>Another example of a common, benign vascular tumour that is closely
    related to haemangioma is <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed">pyogenic granuloma</a>    (Figure 2). Pyogenic granuloma often affects the gingiva
    (the gums), may cause discomfort or pain and bleeding and
    thus may require <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">intervention(s)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Congenital haemangiomata</strong>, which are much rarer
    than infantile haemangioma, are fully developed lesions at
    birth and may be of significant size. They tend to occur
    in the same locations as infantile haemangiomas do, but are
    microscopically distinct from infantile haemangiomata. There
    are two types of congenital haemangiomata: those that rapidly
    involute after birth and typically will have resolved at
    12 months of age; and those that do not involute (and some
    ‘in-between’ varieties with partial involution). Those that
    do not involute will show no signs of shrinkage at approximately
    6 months of age and <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">surgical interventions</a>    are often necessary. Apart from this, all other considerations
    for the clinical assessment / diagnosis are the same as for
    infantile haemangiomata.  </p>
<h1 id="vascular-malformations">Vascular malformations</h1>
<p>The term vascular malformation covers a wide range of different
    congenital abnormalities of the vascular systems (capillaries,
    veins, arteries and lymphatic), and a wide range of degrees
    of severity of these conditions. Vascular malformations differ
    from haemangiomata in several regards. Vascular malformations
    do not resolve by themselves over time; they grow proportionately
    with the infant; they are always present at birth; they do
    not involve hyperplastic (increased numbers) endothelial
    cells but consist of an increasingly disturbed and dysfunctional
    architecture of the vessel walls. This vascular dysfunction
    is caused by faulty vasculogenesis (formation of endothelial
    cells from precursor cell in the embryo) and/or angiogenesis
    (sprouting of new blood vessels from existing ones). It is
    generally assumed that vascular malformations grow by expansion
    (hypertrophy) over time rather than proliferation (hyperplasy)
    as haemangiomata do, but there are also exceptions from this
    pattern. Vascular malformations may remain asymptomatic for
    a long time but tend to be activated by mechanical (for example,
    injury) or hormonal (for example, puberty or pregnancy) stimulus.</p>
<p>Vascular malformations can affect a single type of vessel, combinations
    of different types of vessels, or may occur in combination
    with other, non-vascular anomalies. Vascular malformations
    are more often associated with other syndromes than haemangioma,
    although these are rare conditions overall. Vascular malformations
    also differ in their flow characteristics. On overview of
    the diverse range of vascular malformations is collected
    in Table 1.</p>

    Venous malformation; AVM: arterio-venous malformation</p>
<p>As the diverse range of vascular malformations in Table 1 suggests,
    severity, appearance, signs and symptoms of these conditions
    are equally diverse.</p>
<p>With increasing size, vascular malformations can cause pain,
    disfigurement, impaired functionalities, <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">bleeding</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Capillary malformations</strong> are arguably the least
    significant lesion as they are unlikely to create flow abnormalities,
    but can present aesthetic (‘portwine stain’) and sometimes
    bleeding issues.</p>
<p><strong>Venous malformations</strong> are the most common vascular
    malformations.  An example of a venous malformation of the
    lip is shown in Figure 3.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-vascular-abnormalities-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Venous malformation of the lip.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clinically these lesions are classically diagnosed by pressure
    exsanguination (squeezing) using a transparent slide. Low-flow
    abnormalities may have calcifications around areas of very
    low flow or stagnation of blood flow, known as phleboliths
    (phleboliths are a useful test for students in exams when
    the radiographic appearance can catch the unwary, but in
    reality phleboliths are of little consequence).</p>
<p><strong>Lymphatic malformations</strong> are a genuine puzzle
    in many cases. These lesions present as macrocystic and microcystic
    malformations. Basically macrocystic lymphangiomata are big
    benign <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a> and
    can be <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst">managed as such</a>.
    Microcystic lesions are problematic in that they can vary
    in presentation in time and place in the same person. This
    can create a very confusing story and can sometimes mean
    the story of recurrent substantial swelling of an organ (for
    example the tongue) is doubted. The microcystic lymphatic
    lesion depicted in Figure 4 could at various times be invisible,
    or completely block the front of this girl’s mouth.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-vascular-abnormalities-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Microcystic lymphatic malformation
        of the tongue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Arteriovenous malformations</strong> are very high-flow
    lesions and are relatively rare. Interventional radiology
    is nowadays the mainstay of diagnosis, <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">treatment planning and intervention</a>.</p>
