<p>Clefts of the lip and palate are the most common craniofacial
    (head and face) malformations, and comprise 65 % of all anomalies
    affecting the head and neck. There are two useful distinct
    types of cleft anomaly, cleft lip with or without cleft palate,
    and isolated cleft palate. There is a difference in the pathogenesis
    (development of the condition) of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate/detailed">two anomalies</a>.</p>
<p>As a parent whose child has a cleft, or possibly an adult with
    a treated or partially treated cleft of the lip and palate
    we hope to provide some information which will guide you
    through a number of choices you will have to make.</p>
<p>Much of this information should complement the information provided
    by your neonatal service which will (certainly in the UK)
    have already put you in touch with your regional cleft lip
    and palate service, often by way of a specialist nurse. The
    UK national association is called CLAPA (Cleft Lip and Palate
    Association).</p>
