<p>Postoperative problems affecting the back include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars. The major reasons for postoperative problems on the
        back in maxillofacial patients are the harvesting of
        flaps for <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive purposes</a>        to repair soft and/or hard tissue defects. The two donor
        sites are<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>the latissimus dorsi muscle (the large, flat muscle
                to the side of the back and running from the
                mid to the lower back), used for free (where
                the transferred tissue is completely detached
                from the donor site) or pedicled (where the transferred
                tissue remains partially connected with the donor
                site) flaps;</li>
            <li>any variation of the scapula (shoulder blade) free
                flap.</li>
        </ul>Both these donor sites can be closed primarily. The latissimus
        dorsi and parascapular (vertically orientated) version
        of the scapula skin flap are vertically running scars
        on the back that are rarely infected and heal well. The
        horizontally designed scapula skin flap has a scar which
        tends to spread and is generally less aesthetic.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/shoulder">Shoulder function</a>.
        This can be quite seriously interfered with by harvesting
        the bone of the lateral border (on the side) of the scapula.
        This bone is less useful for most <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">jaw reconstruction</a>        purposes than the fibula (the smaller of the two long
        bones in the lower leg) or iliac crest (part of the hip)
        bones but is very rarely involved in peripheral vascular
        disease (which may limit the choice of harvest locations
        in some patients). A small number of centres use the
        scapula flap predominantly and it is worthwhile considering
        the alternatives, particularly if the scapula flap is
        taken from the same side as the <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">neck dissection</a>        on the side of the dominant arm (dictated by the site
        of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">cancer</a> or
        other pathology being removed). Limitation of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/upper-arm">function of the arm</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/shoulder">shoulder</a>        and associated pain, especially if on the dominant side,
        cannot be underestimated.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>        is rarely noticed as a problem.</li>
</ul>
