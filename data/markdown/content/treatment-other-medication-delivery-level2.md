<p>Understanding the effects of timing, delivery methods and interactions
    with your medication(s) not only helps to manage the routines
    of application, it makes it easier to spot signs and symptoms
    of unwanted medication-related effects.</p>
<h1 id="drug-timings-and-dosage">Drug timings and dosage</h1>
<p>When trying to understand a drug's effect, two main areas
    must be considered: the first is how the drug works and the
    effects it will have on the body (pharmacodynamics), the
    second is how your body will affect the drug and how the
    drug moves around the body (pharmacokinetics).</p>
<p>An important aspect of drug design, that will help determine
    the concentration of the dose given, is knowing how much
    of a given dose will reach its target site. Orally administered
    drugs, for example, can lose some of their concentration
    before even reaching the bloodstream, as they are broken
    down in the digestive tract. Once the drug enters the blood,
    it will be carried to all the organs in the body. Organs
    such as the liver and the kidneys will remove the drug from
    the body by metabolising (breaking down) and/or excreting
    it.</p>
<p>The term describing this loss of the drug is bioavailability.
    This provides information on the amount of a drug dose that
    is available to carry out its desired function.</p>
<p>For a drug to be able to work and travel to where it is needed,
    it must first pass through numerous membranes in the body.
    This is known as drug transport. The drug can either be transported
    around the body through the cells (transcellular) or via
    the fluid in between the cells (paracellular).</p>
<p>A drug will start to produce its desired effect once its concentration
    at the target site reaches a certain critical value. Once
    this happens the drug will start to interact with compounds
    at the target site (proteins or DNA) which will then produce
    a response. The time taken for this to happen will vary with
    the drug and the size of the dose given. In general, the
    higher the dose, the shorter the time until the response.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Plot of drug concentration against
        time. In blue: example of a drug with a fast rise and
        fast fall of concentration; in pink: example of a drug
        with a slow rise and slow fall of concentration. These
        are the two extremes, everything in between is possible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As can be seen from Figure 1, after taking a single dose the
    effect of the drug on the body will decrease over time. How
    long this will take depends on the drug and how quickly it
    is removed from the target site. Removal of the drug can
    happen by excretion, metabolism or redistribution to other
    parts of the body. The drug will continue to have an effect
    so long as its concentration at the target site exceeds a
    minimal effective concentration.</p>
<p>Drugs are designed so that they can provide successful treatment
    whilst giving minimal adverse side effects. Taking too little
    of the drug will mean that it won’t be able to produce its
    desired effect. Taking too much of the drug means that there
    will be too high a risk of adverse effects and so the risk
    of toxicity from the drug will outweigh the benefits. Every
    drug is toxic in high enough concentrations.</p>
<p>By controlling dose concentration and timing, drug concentrations
    can be kept inside a window that will produce successful
    therapy. The desired effect will be produced without causing
    too many adverse effects. This concentration range is called
    the therapeutic window and will be different for every drug
    (see Figure 2) and may vary from person to person.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Sketch of the therapeutic window;
        the red trace symbolises beneficial effects, the blue
        trace symbolises adverse effects. Left: an example of
        a drug with a narrow therapeutic window; right: an example
        of a drug with a wide therapeutic window.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 2 shows that both the probability of the desired response
    (red trace) and the adverse response (blue trace) will increase
    with increasing drug concentrations. For each drug a decision
    will have been made as to what extent the beneficial effects
    of the drug outweigh the adverse ones. The answer will be
    very dependent on both the drug and the condition being treated.
    Obviously, drugs which are characterised by a wide therapeutic
    window are safer to use than those with a narrow therapeutic
    window (a well-known drug with a narrow therapeutic window
    is paracetamol).</p>
<p>Drugs will be prescribed to be taken as a fixed dose with a fixed
    time interval between doses. This means that the concentration
    of the drug in the body will be constantly changing, but
    will eventually rise towards a fixed value - known as a plateau.
    This is because each time a new dose is taken, only some
    of the drug from the previous dose will have left the body.
    This is illustrated in Figure 3.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Plot of drug concentration against
        time, with new administration of the drug at regular
        intervals. Over time, the overall concentration of the
        drug in the body reaches a plateau.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Taking a dose of a drug too frequently will mean that it is more
    likely for the concentration to exceed the plateau (which
    has been designed as a safe level of a drug). This means
    that the level of the drug in the body may no longer be within
    the therapeutic window (see Figure 2) and so adverse effects
    may start to occur.</p>
<h1 id="drug-delivery-vehicles">Drug delivery vehicles</h1>
<p>The most common form of drug delivery is oral administration.
    It is favoured for its ease of use. However, it is one of
    the slowest and least efficient forms of drug delivery and
    many drugs cannot be administered this way. This is because
    drugs given orally must first pass through the digestive
    system before being absorbed. Some drugs are broken down
    during this process and are called “orally inactive”, and
    hence are administered in other ways.</p>
<p>Taking drugs orally can cause harm to the digestive system. Although
    tablets provide a consistent dosing, this does not account
    for the contents of the stomach. Taking drugs orally on a
    full stomach will reduce absorption of the drug, but taking
    them on an empty stomach can increase the risk of causing
    damage to the stomach lining and in some cases even lead
    to stomach ulcers (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics</a>,
    such as ibuprofen or aspirin, can cause such problems). Some
    drugs (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotics</a>)
    when taken orally can harm the beneficial bacteria in the
    gut, leading to a range of health implications.</p>
<p>When oral administration is not suitable or not desirable, suppositories
    can be used. The drug is administered in solid (soft, waxy)
    form into the rectum, urethra or vagina, where it melts and
    dissolves. Suppositories can be used when prolonged drug
    action is required. The major disadvantage of this method
    is that it is slightly inconvenient and can cause irritation
    at the site of administration. Absorption of drugs from suppositories
    can be unpredictable.</p>
<p>Another drug delivery method is transmucosal administration.
    The drug is used in the form of nasal sprays, gels or as
    quick dissolving tablets for oral use. The drug is administered
    either into the mouth or into the nose where it diffuses
    through the mucosa (tissue that lines the mouth or nose).
    Once diffused through the mucosa, the drug enters the bloodstream
    via the jugular veins (large veins in the neck, which carry
    blood from the head and face) from where it is delivered
    to its site of action. This method is suitable for patients
    who have difficulty <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing</a>,
    since the drug diffuses through the mucosa instead of having
    to be swallowed. This method also bypasses the digestive
    tract, avoiding the risks that were mentioned above for oral
    delivery. There is a small risk of accidentally swallowing
    the delivery system before it has had a chance to diffuse,
    which may render the treatment ineffective.</p>
<p>Drugs can also be administered via the nose or mouth in the form
    of an inhalant. Although drugs taken this way can spread
    to the rest of the body, this method is typically only used
    at the drug target (for example, decongestant nasal sprays).
    Inhalants are a very fast form of drug delivery but require
    a specialised delivery gadget (the inhaler itself) which
    must be able to administer the correct amount of drug each
    time.</p>
<p>In transcutaneous administration the drug is directly applied
    to the skin, for example as creams, ointments and skin patches.
    The active ingredients then dissolve through the skin and
    into the bloodstream. Advantages of this method are that
    prolonged and controlled drug release can be easily achieved,
    allowing for a constant level of the drug in the bloodstream,
    as well as being non-invasive. However, some people can have
    allergic reactions to the adhesive chemicals in skin patches
    which can cause contact dermatitis (irritation) at the site
    of application.</p>
<p>When drugs are injected they can be injected in one of three
    main ways (see Figure 4): intravenously (into a vein), intramuscularly
    (into a muscle) or subcutaneously (into a layer of fat and
    connective tissue under the skin). Intravenous delivery is
    the fastest method with drugs reaching their target in seconds,
    whereas intramuscular and subcutaneous injections provide
    a slower continuous release of a drug (with intramuscular
    delivery being faster than subcutaneous).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info/figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> A summary of the three main injection
        modes: into a vein, into a muscle, into a subcutaneous
        layer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Injections are favoured for their efficiency and speed of delivery.
    Intravenous injections are essential in emergency situations
    when drugs may be needed immediately at a target site. Intramuscular
    and subcutaneous injections are very useful for a slower
    and more steady release of drugs and are suitable for drugs
    that are orally inactive such as insulin. Both intramuscular
    and subcutaneous injections can be self-administered in various
    ways and at different locations of the body.</p>
<p>Signals, either from the brain to the body (in the case of movement)
    or from the body to the brain (in the case of registering
    senses), are carried via long thin cells called neurons.
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">Local anaesthetics</a>    temporarily disable the neurons’ ability to carry signals.
    This blockage is useful for preventing pain during operations
    avoiding general anaesthetics, or for treating other existing
    pain. Local anaesthetics can be administered as injections
    or topologically as a cream, gel or ointment.</p>
<h1 id="drug-interactions">Drug interactions</h1>
<p>With most effects referred to as ‘drug interactions’ being unwanted
    or harmful effects, and with increasing numbers of people
    being on long-term medication with some times elaborate ‘drug
    cocktails’, interactions of drugs with other drugs, of drugs
    with food or drink as well as patient-specific responses
    are an increasingly important consideration for the safe
    management of medication plans.</p>
<p><strong>Drug - drug interactions</strong>: this type of interaction
    occurs between different drugs, including prescribed and
    over the counter medications, herbal remedies and dietary
    supplements. Some examples of this type of interaction include:</p>
<p>·       Warfarin and antibiotics – warfarin is a widely used
    anticoagulant (blood thinner) to reduce blood clotting; antibiotics
    overall are probably one of the most widely prescribed type
    of medications, for the treatment or prevention of bacterial
    infections. Some common antibiotics and antifungals (for
    example, metronidazole and fluconazole) enhance the blood-thinning
    effect of warfarin, leading to a significantly increased
    risk of major bleeding events or strokes. Antibiotics are
    not the only drugs that increase or lower the blood-thinning
    effect of warfarin, accordingly its effects need to be carefully
    monitored by regular <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests (INR)</a>.</p>
<p>·       <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/other">Opioids</a> and opioids
    and/or alcohol – a wide range of opioids are used as analgesics
    to treat moderate to severe pain, or are being used as recreational
    drugs. Examples are morphine or codeine, tramadol, cannabis
    (tretrahydrocannabinol, THC). These drugs are depressants,
    and so is <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol</a>,
    and these can mutually enhance these effects. Taking several
    opioids together and/or with alcohol can result in extreme
    drowsiness, impaired motor skills and lack of coordination.
    At higher doses this can lead to seizures, coma and death.</p>
<p><strong>Drug – food / drink interactions</strong>: this type
    of interaction occurs between medications and food / drink.
    This should not be a big surprise, after all food and drink
    are metabolised in a variety of ways, many of which will
    at some stage lead to encounters with the metabolism of drugs,
    especially drugs taken orally. Some examples of this type
    of interaction include:</p>
<p>·       Grapefruit - grapefruit (and some other citrus fruit)
    contains a type of chemical, furanocoumarins, that inhibits
    an enzyme (cytochrome P450) that is involved with metabolising
    (breaking down) many drugs in the liver and in the intestines.
    More than 50 drugs are known to be affected (when taken orally).
    Because of inhibiting this enzyme, the blood concentration
    levels of these drugs are increased, sometimes to dangerous
    levels, thus increasing the risk of serious adverse effects,
    depending on which drug is insufficiently metabolised.</p>
<p>·       Cheese and MAOI’s – MAOI’s (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)
    are drugs commonly used to treat Parkinson’s disease and
    depression. MAOI’s inhibit an enzyme that keeps the concentration
    of a naturally occurring amino acid, tyramine, at the correct
    concentration by metabolising any surplus of tyramine. While
    inhibiting this enzyme helps to reduce depression, it also
    leads to increased concentrations of tyramine in the blood
    stream. Tyramine plays an essential role in regulating the
    blood pressure. If tyramine is not sufficiently metabolised
    it can quickly reach dangerously high concentrations. Tyramine
    is found in many foods such as soy sauce, chocolate and particularly
    in aged cheeses such as Stilton. Eating foods rich in tyramine
    while taking MAOI’s can lead to potentially fatal spikes
    in blood pressure. This effect is known as the ‘cheese reaction’.</p>
<p><strong>Drug - patient-specific interactions</strong>: this type
    of interactions can arise from the interaction between medication
    and a pre-existing condition, such as a genetic disposition,
    or a combination of acute and/or chronic conditions occurring
    simultaneously. Some example of this type of interaction
    include:</p>
<p>·       Penicillin – many people are intolerant of the antibiotic
    penicillin and its derivatives (chemically closely related,
    similar drugs (beta-lactams)). The degrees of intolerance
    vary and range from effects such as skin rashes (urticaria),
    itchy eyes and some swelling of face, lips and tongue all
    the way to an extreme allergic reaction, anaphylactic shock,
    which can be life threatening. Around 5 in 10.000 penicillin
    treatments result in anaphylactic shock. An allergic reaction
    to penicillin is an acquired consequence of a previous exposure
    to the drug (possibly even in just minute quantities in food)
    where the immune system misread the drug molecules as harmful
    substance, producing and releasing a specific <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">antibody</a>    (which on the next exposure to the drug triggers the allergic
    reaction, a protective overreaction of the immune system
    to a perceived harmful substance).</p>
<p>Other classes of drugs show a similar spectrum of adverse reactions,
    all the way to   anaphylaxis. For example, many people react
    to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug diclofenac
    (used to treat moderate pain and swelling from inflammation)
    with severe skin rashes but there are also cases of systemic
    anaphylactic shock. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish
    adverse reactions and degrees of intolerance from serious
    allergies.</p>
<p>·       Codeine – codeine belongs to the class of opioid analgesics
    and is used to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">treat mild to moderately severe pain</a>.
    Codeine is a <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/other">pro-drug</a>    and first needs to be converted in the body into its active
    form (morphine). Codeine fails to work as an analgesic in
    about 5-10 % of the population whereas another 5-10 % of
    the population metabolise considerably above-average amounts
    of codeine to morphine. The reason for these deviations from
    the ‘norm’ are differences in genetic make-up (genotypes).
    An enzyme in the liver, CYP2DC, is responsible for the codeine
    metabolism (amongst other substances) and to convert it to
    morphine. This enzyme is over- or under-expressed in a proportion
    of the population due to some genetic peculiarities.</p>
<p>·       Placebo effect – an interesting, and in some regards,
    debated effect of the relationship between body and mind.
    The placebo effect summarizes the contribution(s) of somebody’s
    expectations on the outcome of taking some medication, or
    of some other interventions. If somebody expects adverse
    side effects from taking a drug, say nausea and vomiting,
    covertly giving this person a sugar tablet can trigger exactly
    these effects even if the tablet is completely devoid of
    active ingredients. If somebody expects pain relief from
    a drug, a covertly administered placebo can lead to pain
    relief. In some such cases, it has been shown that the placebo
    effect leads to physical changes. For example, expected and
    imagined pain relief increases the production of <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">endorphins</a>,
    the body’s own version of opioid drugs.</p>
