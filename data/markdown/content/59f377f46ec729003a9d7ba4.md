<p>Below we give short descriptions of the main mechanisms of action
    of the three categories of antibiotic agents: antibacterials,
    antifungals and antivirals.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about specific antibiotic drugs
        and infections, this information is on our detailed page
        about <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">treatment of infections by medication</a>,
        alongside further information about resistance to antibiotic
        drugs.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="antibacterial-agents">Antibacterial agents</h1>
<p>It can be advantageous to identify the type of bacteria responsible
    for an infection before starting treatment, given the large
    number of potentially harmful bacteria. For example, it can
    be useful to know whether bacteria belong to the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">Gram-positive or Gram-negative category</a>    and thus, because of their different types of cell walls
    (see Figure 1), will be susceptible to treatment with different
    types of antibacterial agents. It can also be useful to know
    if an infection is caused by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">anaerobic of aerobic bacteria</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A schematic view of the different
        cell walls in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
        Adapted from C. Bougault, Grenoble.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Where it is not possible to precisely identify the relevant bacteria
    before starting treatment (which is the usual clinical scenario),
    it is common practice to start with a ‘best guess’, usually
    a so called broad-spectrum antibacterial drug (a drug that
    can treat a range of different bacterial infections). If
    later on additional information becomes available, the medication
    regimen can be adapted accordingly (in many maxillofacial
    infection cases, this is an ‘after the event’ scenario: by
    the time the pathogens have been identified, the infection
    has already been cleared).</p>
<p>The ways in which bacteria multiply, their structures and metabolic
    processes, through which they not only survive but thrive
    and replicate, are quite different from the metabolism and
    life cycles of the cells of mammals (including humans). These
    differences can be exploited for treatment with antibacterial
    drugs, which deny the bacterial cells some element(s) that
    are vital for their survival, whereas the host cells are
    only minimally compromised. The logic is to provide the host’s
    cells with a significant competitive advantage over the bacterial
    cells that have so far evaded the body’s immune system, which
    has resulted in infection.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the unwanted effects of
        antibacterial agents on the host’s system, this information
        is on our detailed page about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">infections</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>There are essentially four main mechanisms by which antibacterial
    agents can interfere with bacterial cell function. The sketch
    of a bacterial cell in Figure 2 summarises these four mechanisms.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The four main mechanisms of antibacterial
        effects of drugs; interfering with the cell wall, the
        metabolic processes, the DNA and protein synthesis of
        bacterial cells.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some antibacterial agents kill bacterial cells outright (bactericidal
    agents), others weaken the bacterial cells and hinder their
    replication (bacteriostatic agents). The success of antibacterial
    treatments does not depend on this distinction. It is far
    more important to start treatment promptly, using the most
    suitable type of agent for the treatment of the particular
    pathogen(s) at hand.</p>
<p>Many mammals (including humans) and other living creatures naturally
    synthesise antibacterial substances in their normal metabolic
    processes to stay healthy (frogs, for example, continuously
    produce slime on their skin to keep their skin healthy; slime
    on frog skin contains several substances with antibacterial
    properties). Humans make <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">lysozyme in saliva</a>    and other body fluids (tears); lysozyme is a highly effective
    antibacterial agent, it attacks bacterial cell walls (see
    below). Most / many of the existing synthetic man-made antibacterial
    agents are derived from naturally occurring substances and
    are probably better viewed as ‘discovered’ rather than ‘designed’
    (although this may change in the future).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the role of saliva in maintaining
        oral health in general, and the role and mode of action
        of lysozyme in particular, this information is on our
        detailed page about the <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">oral-health role of saliva</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h2>The bacterial cell wall</h2>
<p>The cells of humans do not have a cell wall, only a membrane.
    In contrast, the strong cell wall of a bacterium is vital
    for its survival. The cell wall also makes a difference with
    regard to mobility of cells: bacterial cells, protected by
    their cell wall, are optimised for moving around and spreading
    in this way, human body cells are optimised to stay in place
    and carry out their various specialised tasks locally.</p>
<p>The bacterial cell wall needs to withstand large internal pressure
    changes within the bacterial cell, a consequence of the need
    to maintain a delicate osmotic balance (water flowing in
    and out of the cell). The cell wall also maintains the integrity
    of the cell membrane without which the controlled exchange
    of chemicals (homeostasis) between the bacterial cell and
    its surroundings is compromised. This vital protective role
    of the cell wall is enabled by a structural protein, peptidoglycan,
    which forms the main structural component of a bacterial
    cell wall. Bacteria have to synthesise peptidoglycan for
    their cell walls themselves.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A schematic view of the structural
        units of a bacterial cell wall, highlighting the peptidoglycan
        cross bridges.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows a cross section of peptidoglycan within the cell
    wall; long strands of the structural protein are interlinked
    with shorter strands. It is this ‘cross hatching’ (analogous
    to the supporting beams in fencing) which improves the ability
    of the cell wall to withstand pressure: the more crosslinks,
    the better the security and stability of the cell. Removal
    or weakening of these links by antibacterial agents weakens
    the cell wall by putting holes in the structure and thus
    leaving it susceptible to cell death. In a further analogy,
    the cell wall can be thought of as a dam of sorts. Antibacterial
    agents that target the cell wall can be thought of as weakening
    and putting holes in the structure of the dam, eventually
    causing water to flood through the wall into the cell and
    causing death of the bacterial cell. Most antibacterial agents
    acting on the cell-wall structures achieve this weakening
    effect by attaching themselves to the cell wall and creating
    weak spots, either for the agent itself to break the cell
    wall (for example lysozyme works in this way; see above)
    or to enable other chemicals (enzymes) to do so. This mechanism
    is illustrated in Figure 4.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Top part: a bacterial cell with
        an intact cell wall; bottom part: the cell wall structural
        protein, peptidoglycan, weakened by the action of an
        antibacterial agent, followed by cell death.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Some metabolic processes of the bacterial cell</h2>
<p>Some metabolically important substances are available to humans
    from dietary sources, whereas bacteria have to produce these
    substances for themselves <i>via</i> their metabolic processes.
    A sketch of a metabolic process is shown in Figure 5; smaller
    chemical units are put together to build bigger, more useful
    molecules for the cell. If a bacterial cell has to synthesise
    (make) a molecule in order to survive, then hampering this
    production process will have the same effect as starvation.</p>
<p>Where it is possible to deny a bacterial cell the necessary nutrients
    and resources, this will ultimately lead to the death of
    the bacterial cell by starvation. An example of a chemical
    which is taken in through the diet in humans but has to be
    synthesised by bacterial cells is tetrahydrofolate, a part
    of the vitamin B cycle (see Figure 5). Preventing tetrahydrofolate
    production <i>via</i> inhibition of folic acid production
    in the bacterial cell leads to a deficiency of that molecule
    in the bacterial cell and the ultimate purpose of the product
    remains unexecuted. Folic acid is important in the making
    of DNA (in all cells), so prevention of its synthesis in
    the bacterial cell makes cell death imminent as the cell
    can no longer replicate DNA.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Illustration of the metabolic
        synthetic pathway from folic acid to tetrahydrofolate
        in a bacterial cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In a slightly different mechanism which also interferes with
    the metabolic processes of the bacterial cells, some antibacterials
    can mimic the structure of molecules needed by the cell and
    resulting in their uptake instead of the normal molecule.
    This is schematically illustrated in Figure 6. It results
    in a deficiency as the cell fails to uptake and/or synthesise
    the correct and necessary molecule for its survival. This
    ‘pretender’ mechanism is also exploited in a range of drugs
    used in conventional <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles/more-info">chemotherapy</a>,
    where for example, 5-fluorouracil is administered systemically
    and replaces uracil as the normal substrate in the cell metabolism.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Comparing the normal synthesis
        pathway (left) with the incorporation of a mimic, leading
        to a non-functional product.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once a bacterial cell has assembled a larger molecule, proper
    functionality requires this molecule to fit into the chemical
    and biological machinery of the cell. The molecule and the
    machinery often have complementary shapes, they match up
    well and any disruptions in this matching process results
    in the machinery being unable to function. ‘Pretender’ molecules
    smuggled into the cell’s metabolic pathways can either block
    the synthetic pathway from complete execution, or may lead
    to final products that are mismatched and thus cannot fulfil
    their specific biochemical task.</p>
<h2>The protein synthesis in the bacterial cell</h2>
<p>Synthesising  proteins in all cells is much like following a
    recipe. Proteins are made from small molecular building blocks
    (amino acids). A bacterial cell has all the cellular equipment
    and machinery it needs as well as a recipe to follow, encoded
    in the form of DNA molecules. DNA is essentially the cell’s
    list of instructions as to how and when to make proteins,
    and is even able to go so far as to dictate how much of a
    protein is needed (depending on its function/importance within
    the cell). A part of the machinery necessary for protein
    synthesis in a cell is a structure known as a ribosome (a
    very large molecule), comprised of a small compartment and
    a large compartment.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The basic building blocks and
        function of the ribosome.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before DNA can be ‘read’ by a ribosome, it needs first to be
    converted into a different language, which the ribosome can
    more easily and readily interpret. This translation is the
    function of another large molecular structure which goes
    by the name of RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase can simply
    be thought of as a middleman responsible for simplification
    of the recipe. Rewriting the recipe as a long linear line
    of instructions is easier to follow than the original message
    encoded in the twisted structure of DNA.</p>
<p>This more accessible message is then read by the ribosome which
    uses the string of instructions as a template to put together
    a protein: the ribosome clamps the instructions between its
    two compartments and moves along reading it as it moves,
    simultaneously producing the protein defined by the instruction.
    Figure 8 contrasts this ribosome action in normal circumstances
    with the situation where an antibacterial agent interferes
    with the role of the ribosome.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> The role of the ribosome in reading
        the instructions in its normal, undisturbed state (left
        part) and the consequences of blocking the process (right
        part) for the cell’s protein synthesis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Antibacterial agents which interfere with protein synthesis can
    block the reading space within the ribosome in which the
    instructions would normally bind. Alternatively, they can
    prevent other molecules from binding to the ribosome (molecules
    that would normally help it to read the instructions more
    efficiently). Some antibacterials in this group allow the
    initial binding of the ribosome to the instructions but cause
    the machinery to misread the instructions, producing partially
    or completely dysfunctional proteins. All of these interferences
    mean that the bacterial cell ribosomes do not produce the
    correct functional proteins that the cell would need in order
    to survive.</p>
<h2>Bacterial DNA</h2>
<p>DNA is considered to be the recipe book for the cell’s protein
    syntheses. The DNA contains in an encrypted way (quite like
    a computer algorithm) the instructions for every protein
    the cell will ever need. However, the coiled and helical
    structure of the DNA keeps this message protected and stable
    within the cell so that it is not damaged as it is passed
    on during replication from cell to cell, from generation
    to generation. This is true for bacterial cells as well as
    for cells of mammals (including humans).</p>
<p>In order to synthesise new DNA for cell replication, the DNA
    has to be unwound from this protective supercoil arrangement
    in order for its instructions to be ‘read’, replicated and
    afterwards rewound. Essential worker molecules (enzymes)
    carry out these biochemical roles within a cell.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure9.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> The supercoiled DNA in the cell,
        prepared for reading the instructions by unwinding the
        double-helical structure, actioned by enzymes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Two such enzymes, RNA polymerase and topoisomerase II, are targets
    for antibacterial agents.</p>
<p><strong>RNA polymerase</strong> is responsible for using template
    strands of DNA to produce complementary strands of DNA, hence
    increasing the amount of DNA in the cell at every generation.
    Enzymes have a lock and key function, with the enzyme being
    the lock, and the key in this analogy is the molecule, or
    set of molecules, to which RNA polymerase binds. RNA polymerase
    is necessary for DNA replication. Preventing RNA polymerase
    from binding, either by altering the shape of RNA polymerase
    or introducing molecules to prevent the DNA from binding
    to it are mechanisms underlying antibacterial effects. As
    all bacterial (and host) cells contain DNA, interfering with
    the DNA synthesis can be considered as a ‘broad spectrum’
    action of an antibacterial agent. Figure 10 symbolises this
    mechanism of interference with DNA synthesis.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> A mechanism of interference by
        some antibacterials with DNA synthesis by preventing
        the unwinding of the DNA moelcule.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as interfering with the production of new DNA molecules,
    access to the template strands can be denied through inhibiting
    another enzyme, <strong>topoisomerase II</strong>. This enzyme
    is responsible for the supercoiling of DNA. Failure to regulate
    this winding of DNA can cause a build-up of torsion in the
    (fragile) DNA molecule, destabilising it and preventing the
    RNA polymerase from moving along the template strand, thus
    preventing synthesis of new DNA molecules. Not only the cell
    machinery responsible for making new DNA strands is vulnerable
    to interference(s) by antibacterials but also those molecules
    which regulate the process are susceptible to obstruction/hindrance
    (again, similar mechanisms of interference are exploited
    in some <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles/more-info">chemotherapy drugs</a>).</p>
<h1 id="antifungal-agents">Antifungal agents</h1>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">Fungal infections</a> have
    become more common over recent years. Factors contributing
    include an increase in the (over)use of broad-spectrum antibacterials,
    steroid inhalers, and larger numbers of people living with
    weakened immune systems (immuno-compromised) either after
    organ transplants, or during cancer treatments by <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemo-</a>    or <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>, or
    by living with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">HIV infection</a>,
    or simply old age. A general reduction in commensal (useful)
    bacteria in the body not only makes infection by other, more
    harmful, bacteria easier, it makes it also easier for fungi
    to cause infection in an opportunistic way.</p>

        skin microflora, this information is on our detailed
        page about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">infections</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Similar to the philosophy of exploiting various different working
    mechanisms in antibacterial drugs, there are also four main
    mechanisms of action of antifungal agents. These four main
    mechanisms are summarised and symbolised in the sketch in
    Figure 11. There are further similarities between antibacterial
    and antifungal agents: several of these substances display
    both antibacterial and antifungal properties. This can be
    explained by some of the structural and functional similarities
    between bacteria and fungi.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure11.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> The four main mechanisms of antifungal
        effects of drugs; interfering with the cell membrane
        (ergosterol), the DNA, the metabolic processes, and the
        cell wall of fungal cells.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Cell membrane</h2>
<p>The cell membranes of fungi contain a structurally and functionally
    important molecule, ergosterol. It works in the same ways
    as cholesterol works in the cell membranes of humans but
    ergosterol is not present in human cells. This makes it a
    useful structure at which to direct antifungal drugs.</p>
<p>Some antifungals can bind with ergosterol. This results in the
    formation of holes or pores in the cell membrane structure;
    these holes have an effect similar to inserting straws into
    the membrane. These ‘straws’ (ion channels) give fluid (cytoplasm)
    normally contained within the cell an outlet from which the
    contents of the cell can leak out, causing cell death.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure12.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> Action of an antifungal agent
        on ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, creating ion
        channels and draining of cell liquids through these channels.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Fungal DNA</h2>
<p>Some antifungals, upon entering the fungal cell, are converted
    into 5-fluorouracil, a chemical which competitively inhibits
    uracil from being included in newly synthesised DNA and RNA
    (uracil is one of the four basic DNA building blocks). Medicinal
    drugs that need to be converted into their chemically active
    form after delivery to their site of action of action are
    called pro-drugs (codeine is a well-known example – it needs
    to be converted to morphine in the body).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about drug delivery and pro-drugs,
        this information is on our pages about <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">drug delivery</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>As an inhibitor of normal DNA and RNA synthesis, 5-fluorouracil
    causes cellular growth imbalances and ultimately the death
    of the fungal cells affected. In a different setting and
    different (systemic) drug delivery, the same underlying mechanism
    is exploited in the role of 5-fluorouracil as a chemotherapy
    drug.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the impact of 5-fluorouracil
        on DNA synthesis, this information is on our detailed
        page about <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles/detailed">chemotherapy drugs</a>.</p>
</aside>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure13.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Delivery of a pro-drug to the
        fungal cell, followed by synthesis of cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil
        from the inactive pro-drug inside the fungal cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Metabolic inhibition</h2>
<p>Targeting different stages of the ergosterol synthesis pathway
    (see above) always yields the same overall result: production
    of ergosterol is prevented. For example, some specific enzymes
    within fungal cells (p450 enzymes) are necessary to produce
    ergosterol. Many antifungal agents can bind with the p450
    enzymes, thus blocking the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.
    Because this inhibition mechanism is common amongst antifungals
    and p450 enzymes are common to fungi, antifungal agents that
    reduce the production of ergosterol are classed as broad-spectrum
    antifungals. Figure 14 illustrates this metabolic inhibition
    mechanism.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure14.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 14:</strong> Contrasting the normal ergosterol
        synthesis pathway (left) with the effect of blocking
        the pathway (right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Cell Wall</h2>
<p>The building blocks of bacterial cell walls are a target for
    the action of some antibacterial agents (see above). Similarly,
    there are structural building blocks unique to the cell walls
    of fungi that can serve as a target for antifungal agents.
    In fungal cell walls, the critical structural unit is a substance
    called chitin (a fibre-forming polysaccharide). Any antifungals
    that prevent chitin from forming in the cell wall cause a
    weakening of the fungal cell wall, eventually resulting in
    cell death (see Figure 15). Chitin is a chemical not found
    in human cells. It may thus be advantageous to use antifungal
    drugs that target chitin formation as this may minimise unwanted
    effects on the host’s system.</p>

        antibiotic agents on the host, this information is on

        agent weakens the chitin-supported cell wall structure,

</figure>
<h1 id="antiviral-agents">Antiviral agents</h1>
<p>The structures and functionalities of viruses are even further
    from those of our own cells than bacterial or fungal cells.
    Viruses are made up of a single piece of DNA or RNA contained
    within a coating made of proteins (a capsid). Unlike bacterial
    and fungal cells, there are no cell walls, cell membranes
    or protein-synthesising machinery in viral cells. Accordingly,
    the working mechanisms of antiviral drugs will have to be
    different from those of antibacterial or antifungal agents.
    Figure 16 summarises the four types of cells and their main
    features. Figure 16 also serves as a reminder that there
    is no benefit from taking antibacterial drugs when suffering
    from a trivial viral infection, such as a common cold or
    sore throat (quite the opposite is true – it only comes with
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">unwanted effects of antibacterials</a>    on the host).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level2-figure16.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 16:</strong> A sketch of viral cells (top
        part), in comparison with typical fungal, bacterial and
        mammal cells (bottom part). Included in the mammal cell
        sketch are only some of the many components of such cells:
        Golgi (responisble for packaging of proteins), rough
        and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (structures involved
        in the fabrication of proteins and lipids), mitochondria
        (production and storage of energy, regulation of cell
        metabolism), lysosome (storage of hydrolytic enzymes).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to reproduce (replicate) viruses have to take over the
    cells of the host. They need to ‘borrow’ protein-synthesis
    machinery and other cellular components from the host. They
    can do this either by getting inside the host cell, or by
    inserting just their viral DNA into the cell. The result
    of this invasion is that human host cells are (ab)used as
    factories for the production of new viruses. These newly
    produced viruses are released when the infected host cell
    dies. This close and direct dependence of the infectious
    agent, the virus, with the structure and function of the
    host cells explains why it is so difficult to develop drugs
    that only, or mainly, act on the virus and not the human
    cells (see Figure 17).</p>

<p>The ability of viruses to change (mutate) their protein coat
    further complicates the task of finding viable antiviral
    agents. The proteins making up the viral capsid can be used
    as drug targets. However, if the proteins, and thus the shape
    of the virus capsid, change rapidly any newly developed,
    or already established, antiviral drugs may miss the target.
    The molecular protein structures that once were a suitable
    and susceptible target for a particular drug may no longer
    be expressed by the virus strain and the originally designed
    drug will have lost its bite.</p>
<p>A subgroup of infectious viruses survive by following an even
    more integrated invasion path within the host cells. After
    infection, these viruses live within the DNA of the host
    cells and thus cannot be completely removed from there. The
    best known example of this kind of so called retrovirus is
    probably the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV. Treatment
    options for retrovirus infections require careful consideration
    of antiviral agents which mainly influence  the viral load
    and less so the DNA of the host. Figure 18 symbolises the
    infection mechanism and its integration in the host DNA by
    a retrovirus.</p>

<p>Below we outline the main working principles of antiviral drugs
    currently used to treat infections with a retrovirus and
    a ‘normal’ virus. Medication treatment for ‘normal’ viral
    infections is far less widely used than medications for bacterial
    or fungal infections.</p>
<h2>Retrovirus antiviral agents</h2>
<p>There are several enzymes, which participate in the task of integrating
    the viral DNA into the DNA in the host cell (for example,
    reverse transcriptase; see Figure 18). Preventing this function
    of reverse transcriptase means the the viral DNA will not
    be integrated into the DNA of the host cell. Antivirals developed
    for treatment of retroviruses such as HIV focus on reverse
    transcriptase inhibition.</p>
<p>In order to convert the DNA of a virus into a form that fits
    the host’s DNA, the reverse transcriptase molecule requires
    some additional smaller building blocks, called deoxynucleotides,
    which occur naturally in the host cell. Some antiviral agents
    that are ‘pretender’ molecules (<strong>viral DNA base mimics</strong>)
    mimic the building blocks that reverse transcriptase usually
    bonds with, except for a few small but important differences.
    This mimicry means that the reverse transcriptase cannot
    build stable or lasting structures, resulting in a decrease
    in the rate of infection by the virus. Other inhibitors of
    reverse transcriptase interfere directly with the main part
    of its structure through which it binds to the viral DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Protease inhibitors</strong> are another type of antiviral
    agents that reduce the virus load from infection with a retrovirus.
    After the viral DNA has been integrated into the DNA of the
    host cell, the next step of the infection cycle is the building
    of new viruses from this new instruction template imposed
    on  the host DNA. The template is read by the host cells’
    protein-making machinery (the ribosome; see above) to serve
    the needs of virus replication. The final resulting proteins
    need to be cut free from the template before they can serve
    their function. This is done by enzymes called proteases.
    Antivirals can prevent this final ‘cutting’ step by blocking
    the part of the cutter enzyme which attaches to the virus
    proteins. Functional versions of the virus proteins, made
    in the host cell, are then not processed and no new viruses
    will be assembled and released.</p>
<h2>Other antiviral agents (targeting ‘normal’ viruses)</h2>
<p>Some antiviral drugs, effective in treating infections with ‘normal’
    viruses,  work by <strong>stopping new viruses from escaping</strong>    from the host cell. New viruses (virions) are not released
    from the host cell because an enzyme (neuroaminidase) is
    blocked by these agents. Neuroaminidase promotes the movement
    of virions, and blocking this enzyme thus reduces or stops
    the release of virions from the host cell.</p>
<p>Other antiviral drugs <strong>prevent viral DNA replication</strong>    and so prevent the virus from replicating. Antiviral drugs
    achieve this by inhibiting a virus-specific enzyme, DNA polymerase,
    by preventing it from binding to the viral DNA. Another such
    inhibition mechanism blocks other enzymes from binding to
    the DNA polymerase in the replication process. These two
    mechanisms are illustrated in Figure 19.</p>

        process (left part) with the failing assembly when DNA
        polymerase is inactivated (right part).</figcaption>

<p>The human body commands powerful protective mechanisms of its
    own against viral infections, the immune system. <strong>Stimulating an immune response</strong>    is an indirect mechanism by which some drugs boost the number
    and / or activity of the body’s own antiviral agents. This
    includes the boosting of enzymes that break down virus structures
    in the blood stream and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">immunoglobulins</a>.
    A range of different immunoglobulins are synthesised by the
    immune system as a specific response to infections. These
    immunoglobulin molecules continue to circulate in the blood
    stream and specialise in recognising and inactivating specific
    virus cells (immunoglobulins are also responsible for long-term
    immunity against certain infections).</p>
