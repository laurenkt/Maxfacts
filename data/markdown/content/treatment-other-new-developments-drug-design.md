<p>In the workings of biological systems, nature has adopted the
    ‘form follows function’ principle in nearly all cases where
    we currently have a detailed understanding of biochemical
    and metabolic processes. This accounts for the many highly
    specific roles that messenger molecules, antibodies, receptors,
    and so on play in the normal functions of living systems.
    In addition, the action mechanisms of medicinal and recreational
    drugs follow the same principle. In the past, many medicinal
    drugs were typically discovered in a laboratory-based, work-intense
    trial &amp; error approach of synthesizing very large numbers
    of variations of a particular drug candidate molecule, and
    checking all these chemicals for their wanted and unwanted
    properties in a first step.</p>
<h2>The basic tools in modern drug design</h2>
<p>The second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century has seen much
    progress in the</p>
<ul>
    <li>development of biochemical laboratory procedures (such as
        isolating and crystallising proteins, or isotope-labelling
        strategies for subsequent investigations of structure
        and function of proteins);</li>
    <li>structure-elucidation methods suitable for the investigation
        of the structure of large bio-molecules (specialised
        X-ray diffraction techniques, special microscopy methods
        and spectroscopy tools, in particular <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">solution- and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy</a>);</li>
    <li>massively enhanced computing hardware / computing power as
        well as the emergence of powerful software for the analysis
        and manipulation of structural data of large biomolecules,
        including visualisation tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking all these advanced technologies together is key to state
    of the art approaches to a far more rational design of promising
    drug molecules. Drug design depends on the knowledge of the
    target structure / receptor and their role(s) in a biological
    system. Equipped with this knowledge, it is then possible
    to design, with the help of computer algorithms, promising
    molecular candidates for specific medicinal tasks, including
    constraints on their predicted properties, for example restricting
    adverse effects. Only the most promising candidates from
    such an electronic library of molecules will need to be synthesized
    in the laboratory for further pre-clinical testing – and
    for a whole raft of reasons, only very few of these candidates
    will actually ever become medicinal drugs in clinical use
    after many years of further testing and different stages
    of clinical trials.</p>
<h2>Re-designing fentanyl</h2>
<p>One class of medicinal drugs where drug design is a promising
    approach to improve on the existing pool of drugs is the
    vast group of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">opioid analgesics</a>    Opioids are highly potent agents to counteract pain. The
    effects are achieved by the docking of opioids at a range
    of different opioid receptors, some of which are located
    in the central nervous system (brain). Interactions with
    opioid receptor sites in the brain are responsible for the
    adverse effects of opioids, including potential for addiction,
    sedation and respiratory depression.</p>
<p>Fentanyl (Figure 1) is a powerful opioid analgesic, but carries
    a substantial risk of these adverse effects. The objective
    of a recent study to re-design fentanyl was to maintain its
    powerful analgesic action whilst dropping the adverse effects.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-drug-design-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The molecular structures of fentanyl
        (top) and the re-designed derivative, NFEPP (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The structures of fentanyl and its receptor site are known. This
    information permits the deduction of a mechanism of action
    of the drug, by chemically interacting in specific ways with
    the receptor site. It is further well researched that
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">painful inflammation</a> of tissues goes along with the afflicted
        tissue being more acidic than normal tissue (in fact,
        locally enhanced levels of acidity in inflamed tissue
        can be a reason for failure of <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">local anaesthesia</a>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the drug design task for finding a re-designed fentanyl
    derivative can be summarised as follows: find a modification
    of fentanyl that preserves its powerful analgesic action
    but only binds to opioid receptor sites in environments with
    enhanced acidity. This can be achieved by simulating an inflammatory
    situation and by varying the acidity levels in the virtual
    environment (which would be impossible to do in a real laboratory
    experiment), and varying the exact molecular drug composition
    for optimum binding. At least for the management of severe
    pain caused by inflammation, this would be an attractive
    modification to a powerful opioid (but would not cover other
    analgesia applications). Figure 1 shows the result of searching
    for a fentanyl derivative with the specified properties,
    called NFEPP. The modification is really minor, with only
    two hydrogen atoms being replaced by fluorine atoms.</p>
<p>Subsequently, NFEPP has been synthesized in the laboratory to
    be compared with the actions of fentanyl. NFEPP was initially
    tested on some cell lines to demonstrate that indeed it is
    preferentially taken up in more acidic environments. In the
    usual following step in the procedures of characterising
    a promising drug candidate, the analgesic properties of NFEPP
    have been tested and confirmed in rats. Additional experiments
    on rats have also demonstrated that NFEPP has no action on
    central nervous opioid receptors but solely docks on the
    receptors in inflamed tissue and/or sites of injury in general
    where the pain signals originate.</p>
<p>NFEPP thus has taken a first step from the computer to the laboratory.
    From there, it will be many years until it will be known
    if NFEPP (or further optimised versions of it) becomes a
    clinically useful drug.</p>
<p>The case study of NFEPP not only illustrates some general principles
    in the design of new and/or improved drugs. It also gives
    food for thought in terms of analgesics in general. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">NSAIDs</a>    such as ibuprofen are over-the-counter analgesic drugs, widely
    used and with a range of adverse effects, although they do
    not carry an addiction risk. For example, NSAIDs can cause
    serious problems such as gastric ulcers and bleeds. More
    recently it has been found that NSAIDs also have substantive
    adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Similar drug
    design &amp; optimisation philosophies and techniques could
    be applied for finding improved NSAIDs with fewer and less
    severe adverse effects.</p>
