<p>Surgical removal is the first line treatment for salivary gland
    malignancies, whenever possible. Many of the surgical interventions
    to treat these malignancies are not fundamentally different
    from surgical techniques for the treatment of <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">non-malignant conditions of salivary glands</a>.</p>
<p>Non-malignant salivary gland conditions are far more common than
    malignancies; this is the reason why we describe surgical
    interventions (in particular procedures to remove sublingual,
    submandibular or parotid glands) in the section covering
    the <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">treatment of non-malignant salivary gland conditions</a>.</p>
<p>There are some differences in the surgical (and additional) treatment
    schemes between malignant and non-malignant salivary gland
    conditions. Of relevance for the treatment of malignant salivary
    gland conditions are the following points.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Resection (removal) of a gland (and surrounding tissue(s))
        may have to be more radical than for a non-malignant
        condition, to ensure a margin of healthy tissue is maintained.</li>
    <li>The required degree of radical resection in some cases will
        necessitate <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">surgical reconstruction</a>        of the defect created in the ablative surgery, for hard
        (bone) and/or soft tissues as required.</li>
    <li>If in the removal of a parotid gland the facial nerve (which
        is embedded in the parotid gland) has to be sacrificed,
        then some form of functional rehabilitation is necessary.
        There is no evidence to support resection of a functioning
        facial nerve in parotid or submandibular gland malignancy
        in order to achieve a 1 cm margin of clearance in terms
        of 5 year survival. The facial nerve is mainly a motor
        nerve (it also has some sensory functions) and its loss
        leads to facial paralysis. This is a significant morbidity
        and if the nerve is functioning prior to resection for
        salivary gland malignancy, the aim should be to excise
        the gland and tumour but maintain structural integrity
        of the nerve wherever possible.  The most appropriate
        approach for rehabilitation is, to some extent, also
        determined by the prognosis of the underlying condition.
        In circumstances where surgery is carried out with curative
        intent and with a good overall long-term prognosis, sophisticated
        (and invasive) <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive nerve grafting</a>        may be the best option to restore function. In other
        circumstances and where treatment is <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care">palliative</a>        in nature, it may be better to opt for less invasive,
        simpler rehabilitation options such as a lateral tarsorrhaphy
        (reducing the opening of the eyelids) to minimise ephiphora
        (excessive watering of the eye) and prevent scleral exposure
        (exposure of the eyeball), and a temporalis muscle and
        fascia flap to raise the corner of the mouth combined
        with a simple rhitidectomy (‘face lift’).</li>

<ul>
    <li>Depending on the clinical findings at <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">diagnosis stage</a>,
        it may be necessary to include a <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">neck dissection</a>        in the surgery (lymph nodes in the neck may have to be
        removed in a more or less radical manner).</li>
    <li>Depending on the clinical and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">pathological findings</a>,
        after surgery additional <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        may be required. Sometimes, for example for inoperable
        or fungating tumours (ulcerating tumours breaking through
        skin) or in palliative care, radiotherapy will be the
        treatment modality of choice. It will not be a curative
        treatment in such circumstances.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">Chemotherapy</a> currently
        is of no benefit in the treatment of salivary gland malignancies.</li>
    <li>Malignancies affecting minor salivary glands, in the palate
        or the buccal mucosa (oral lining tissue of the cheek),
        are treated the same way as <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer">squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth</a>;
        similarly, malignancy of the sublingual gland is treated
        the same way as a thick <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer">squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of mouth</a>.</li>
    <li>Careful long-term monitoring and reviewing in an out-patient
        setting are highly desirable for all malignancies of
        the salivary glands.</li>
