<h1 id="dbridement">Débridement</h1>
<p>Débridement is the technical term for removal of necrotic (and/or
    infected) tissue in order to expose viable healthy tissue
    to enable healing of a wound and to prevent development and
    spreading of infection(s) of a wound. There are a variety
    of ways to achieve removal of necrotic tissue, depending
    on the cause and extent of the necrosis.</p>
<p>It is necessary to remove necrotic tissue from a wound because
    its presence maintains the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">initial inflammatory response</a>    of the body to damage, preventing progression to the wound-healing
    phase. Necrotic tissue is also a good breeding ground especially
    for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bacterial infections</a>.
    The blood supply to necrotic tissue is usually impaired,
    so that systemic or topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial medications</a>    may not reach their targets and remain ineffective. Eradication
    of infection in such wounds thus almost always necessitates
    surgical débridement (see below).</p>
<p>Débridement can be achieved in different ways. For small and
    non-infected superficial necrotic areas of skin it may be
    possible to exploit the body’s own enzymes to dissolve any
    debris and dead tissue. This is referred to as autolytic
    débridement and usually needs to be supported by <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/detailed">special wound dressings</a>,
    films and gels that keep the necrotic tissue in contact with
    body / wound fluid. If this is an option, it is a highly
    selective and gentle mechanism as only the necrotic tissue
    will be liquefied in this way.</p>
<p>Débridement of superficial necrotic skin wounds by relying on
    the digestion of this dead tissue by other enzymes is an
    alternative. A range of such enzymes, isolated from plants
    (such as bromelain) or microorganisms (such as <i>clostridium histolyticum</i>)
    exists. They are typically less selective than the body’s
    own enzymes and are of varied effectiveness. This approach
    is not a standard treatment.</p>
<p>There are some further non-standard treatment options for superficial
    necrotic skin wounds. These include application of manuka
    honey; this could be considered a special case of application
    of digestive enzymes (see Figure 1). Another highly selective
    form of treatment is the use of maggots. These creatures
    feed exclusively on necrotic tissue and thus provide a selective
    and pain-free form of wound débridement (the use of maggots
    for such purposes is probably better known for the treatment
    of non-healing diabetic foot ulcers).</p>

<h1 id="surgical-dbridement">Surgical débridement</h1>
<p>Surgical débridement is the fastest and ‘cleanest’ way to remove
    necrotic tissue, to strip a wound back to viable tissue,
    and to enable and improve healing. Viable tissue here means
    tissue with a healthy blood supply. Surgical débridement
    may be carried out using traditional surgical instruments
    such as scalpel or scissors, or a <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">laser</a>.
    It is a selective method with a high level of control of
    the procedure, allowing in-depth inspection of necrotic and
    adjacent tissues. The area surrounding the necrotic tissue
    is thoroughly cleaned and <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/detailed">disinfected</a>,
    the wound is carefully probed and inspected before all necrotic
    tissue is removed. It may be necessary to repeat the procedure
    and the presence of bacterial infection(s) will necessitate
    the use of systemic <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial medications</a>    in addition to surgical intervention. The choice of the most
    suitable antibacterial drug(s) depends on the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">infecting microorganism(s)</a>,
    where infections with MRSA, a range of Gram-negative and/or
    anaerobic bacterial strands, or some <i>streptococci</i>    strands are the prime considerations.</p>
<p>Altogether the surgical management of soft tissue necroses is
    very similar to the surgical treatment protocols for serious
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/abscess/more-info">abscesses</a>    and other soft tissue <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, HBO</a>    may be another option to support surgical and antibacterial
    treatments for some soft tissue infections and necrosis.
    However, the evidence base is conflicting. While there is
    some (weak) evidence of occasional beneficial effects, there
    is a complete lack of criteria that would allow one to predict
    with confidence in which circumstances HBO may be beneficial.</p>
<h1 id="surgical-resection-and-reconstruction">Surgical resection and reconstruction</h1>
<p>In a maxillofacial context, a number of causes can lead to severe
    and persistent soft tissue necroses in need of more radical
    surgical interventions to achieve healing and preservation
    of function. Examples are soft tissue necroses developing
    after <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy treatment</a>,
    or severe infections involving deeper tissues such as
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess/detailed">necrotising fasciitis</a>.</p>
<p>Radical resections in the maxillofacial region for the eradication
    of soft tissue necroses have similar restrictions and reconstructive
    requirements as do other radical resections. For example,
    tissue necrosis and destruction may be near to vital structures,
    a particular concern in the head &amp; neck region.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the wide range of reconstructive
        options in maxillofacial surgery, this information is
        in our section about <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Some considerations for the surgical resection of soft tissue
    necroses in the maxillofacial region are specific to the
    respective underlying cause.</p>
<p>If radiotherapy is the cause of soft tissue necrosis (which may
    occur together with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">hard tissue (bone) necrosis</a>    and remains a life-long risk after radiotherapy), reconstruction
    with skin grafts is usually not an option because the blood
    supply in irradiated soft tissue tends to be impaired. In
    such cases reconstruction with a flap, carrying its own vascular
    supply, is the more promising approach. Figure 2 depicts
    an example of post-radiotherapy necrosis.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-necrosis-soft-level2-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Soft tissue necrosis following
        <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> to
        treat oral cancer. Top: situation before surgical resection
        and reconstruction; bottom: after resection and reconstruction
        with an <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">anterolateral thigh flap</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Diabetes and other autoimmune conditions, a range of comorbidities,
    certain medications (such as bisphosphonates), vessel depletion
    in the neck <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">after neck dissection</a>    and the local/regional tissue quality after multiple surgical
    interventions all considerably increase the risk for the
    development of soft tissue necrosis. Similar additional risks
    exist for the development of necrosis of <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">free flaps</a>    as well as for the respective <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">donor sites</a>.</p>
<p>When extended and/or deep tissues are affected by necrosis originating
    from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>, reconstruction
    of defects after resection may have to be delayed until all
    infection has been eliminated. The chances of success of
    surgical reconstruction would be negatively impacted by the
    continued presence of infected tissues.</p>
<p>Optimal hydration and nutrition, the choice of most suitable
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibiotic agents</a>    for the treatment of infections, sufficiently radical, possibly
    repeatedly, resection and suitably timed and planned reconstruction
    are all crucially important for the successful treatment
    of soft tissue necrosis (alongside a good portion of patience,
    perseverance and resilience to frustration).</p>
<h1 id="treatments-of-soft-tissue-necrosis-in-the-maxillofacial-region-overview">Treatments of soft tissue necrosis in the maxillofacial region
    - overview</h1>
<h2>Oral mucosa</h2>
<p>The most suitable treatment protocol depends on cause and extent
    of the necrosis. Relatively limited necrotic lesions from
    minor <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a> or
    other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">lesions of the oral mucosa</a>    may be treated conservatively. Conservative treatment includes
    a range of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">antiseptic mouthwashes</a>,
    appropriate <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesia</a>    and some form of ‘bandaging’ of the oral mucosa by application
    of a gel that provides a protective thin film as well as
    some degree of pain relief. Figure 3 shows an example of
    necrosis of the oral mucosa shortly after <a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>    and after three months.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-necrosis-soft-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Soft tissue necrosis of the right
        buccal mucosa. Top: seven days after photodynamic therapy;
        bottom: 3 months after photodynamic therapy, healed with
        fibrosis (scarring).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Where conservative treatment is insufficient and extensive surgical
    resection is necessary, for <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    flaps are always preferable over grafts.</p>
<p>Particularly severe cases of necrosis of the oral mucosa acutely
    caused by <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>    or <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> may
    be treatment-limiting for these modalities: the treatment
    may have to be stopped in order to be able to control the
    mucosal necrosis.</p>
<p>The management options for necrosis of the oral mucosa (and/or
    skin; see below) from long-term adverse effects of these
    treatment modalities, in particular <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    are generally similar to the options for acute conditions.
    Treatment details and options for chronic such necrosis conditions
    depend on the involvement, or lack of involvement, of
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">hard tissues</a>, especially the mandible.</p>
<h2>Skin</h2>
<p>Similar to necrosis of the oral mucosa, also for skin necrosis
    the optimal treatment protocol is dictated by the cause and
    extent of the necrosis. Minor necrotic lesions from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage/getting-started">trauma</a>    may be treated with the various non-surgical débridement
    options as appropriate, including topical and/or systemic
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibiotic agents</a>    as required.</p>
<p>When surgical débridement or more radical resection is the method
    of choice, resulting relatively minor skin defects in need
    of reconstruction can be repaired with a skin graft as long
    as any infection has been cleared. For larger skin defects,
    like for oral mucosa, reconstruction by a flap is the preferred
    method. This is especially the case for extended skin necrosis
    following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-necrosis-soft-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Top: soft tissue necrosis of the
        preauricular (in front of the ear) skin, following photodynamic
        therapy; bottom: healthy skin transferred from the neck
        to cover the debrided area.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Deeper tissue layers (fascia, muscle)</h2>
<p>Necrosis affecting deeper tissue layers, including muscle and
    fascia, is most likely to be part of a serious <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    or may result as a long-term effect from <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>.
    As such, the most likely treatment options will be (emergency)
    radical surgical intervention and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">systemic antibacterial medication</a>    when infection is involved (similar in spirits to the
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/abscess/more-info">surgical management of severe abscesses</a>). These conditions
        are likely to require radical resection of necrotic tissues,
        with reconstruction to follow (either immediately following
        resection (see Figure 2 for an example), or after a delay
        until eradication of infection has been achieved). Necrosis
        of deeper tissue layers, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess/detailed">necrotising fasciitis</a>,
        may invade bigger vessels and thus carries a risk of
        serious <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">haemorrhage</a>        that may require emergency surgical intervention.</p>
