<p>Benign (the medical term for non-cancerous) lumps are conditions
    which present as soft tissue swellings. Particularly those
    appropriate for surgical management in the mouth, jaws, skin
    of the face and the neck overlap with many of the other conditions
    outlined in other sections, for example <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that many of the swellings of the
    head and neck are entirely innocent and can be identified
    as being so by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">clinical examination</a>,
    distinct <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">history</a>    and some fairly simple diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>Appropriate treatment of these conditions very often is a relatively
    simple operation under local anaesthesia. Less often a “benign
    lump” may be symptomatic (making the term “benign” seem a
    little odd to the sufferer) or located in a very complicated
    place which necessitates a more complicated operation under
    general anaesthesia.</p>
