<p>Much of the surgery required to remove benign lumps is straightforward.
    It involves finding a natural plane between the lump and
    surrounding healthy, natural hard or soft tissue. This can
    only be learned by feel. Most of surgery is “doing” not “talking”.
    We have therefore only given a brief description that may
    be relevant to patients, carers or neophyte surgeons.</p>
<h1 id="benign-lumps-of-the-mouth-jaws-and-face">Benign lumps of the mouth, jaws and face</h1>
<h2>Brown tumour of hyperparathyroidism</h2>
<p>After diagnosis by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">incisional biopsy</a>,
    treatment is by local excision and curettage (scraping) of
    bone and periosteum (dense connective tissue enveloping bones)
    - if the lesion does not regress spontaneously after treatment
    of the underlying hyperparathyroidism.</p>
<h2>Congenital (present at birth) epulis</h2>
<p>Treatment by local excision in a subperiosteal (beneath the periosteum)
    plane is curative.</p>
<h2>Epulis</h2>
<p>After classification from clinical examination and/or imaging
    features, management of these lesions is according to the
    diagnosis. Most are simply excised in the described “natural
    plane”.</p>
<h2>Fibroepithelial polyp</h2>
<p>These lesions once diagnosed either on a clinical basis or by
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">incisional biopsy</a>,
    should be excised including their base. The pedunculated
    lesion often has a very vascular stalk which will require
    local control with diathermy (stopping bleeding by use of
    electrical heating device) or sutures.</p>
<h2>Granuloma</h2>
<p>Local granulomata are usually treated by simple local excision.
    In the case of orofacial granulomatosis and sarcoidosis,
    intralesional application of steroids may help. In the case
    of orofacial granulomatosis, patch testing for allergic-type
    responses to cinnamates (often found in toothpastes) should
    be undertaken. Elimination diets, to exclude dietary causes,
    can be both diagnostic and therapeutic and may prevent serious
    later facial distortion (see Figure 1).</p>

        can prevent gross labial distortion.</figcaption>

<h2>Giant cell granuloma (giant cell epulis)</h2>
<p>Treatment is by excision that should include the underlying periosteum.</p>
<h2>Gingival fibromatosis</h2>
<p>Treatment is excision by gingivectomy, unless the drugs can be
    changed and this change induces an involution of the swelling.</p>
<h2>Haemangioma</h2>
<p>It should be remembered that 80% will resolve spontaneously.
    Some will respond to the use of steroids or propanolol  to
    promote resolution. Localised cryotherapy (freezing) and
    laser therapy can also resolve these lesions.</p>
<h2>Hyperplasia</h2>
<p>Treatment consists of removing the offending denture to see if
    there is any spontaneous resolution. If there is, then it
    may be possible to manage this non-surgically. If there is
    no such spontaneous resolution, the area should be excised,
    allowed to heal and then new dentures provided. Simple pre-prosthetic
    measures may also be needed to prevent future similar problems.</p>
<h2>Lipoma</h2>
<p>Treatment consists of excision with primary repair.</p>
<h2>Papilloma</h2>
<p>Treatment is by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">excision biopsy</a>.</p>
<h2>Pyogenic granuloma</h2>
<p>Treatment is excision, usually in a deep plane, if the lesion
    causes symptoms.</p>
<h2>Vascular malformations</h2>
<p>Treatment is conventionally by interventional radiology; either
    embolization or sclerosant (a range of chemicals are being
    used for this purpose) injection, coupled with surgical excision
    and reconstruction where indicated. As the move towards minimal
    intervention by embolization techniques has progressed, it
    is important to recognise that these malformations tend to
    recur without synchronized excision.</p>
<h1 id="benign-lumps-of-the-neck">Benign lumps of the neck</h1>
<h2>Cervical lymphadenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck)</h2>
<p>For the treatment of atypical mycobacterial lymphadenitis, there
    is a balance needed between surgical treatment (which remains
    the most effective modality) and watching and waiting with
    long-term clarithromycin treatment (clarithromycin is a macrolide
    antibiotic drug, used for the treatment of a range of bacterial
    infections of the skin and respiratory tract). Clarithromycin
    treatment may avoid an operation but can take a very long
    time and sometimes leaves scars worse than those of surgery.</p>
<h2>Sternomastoid tumour</h2>
<p>Treatment is direct physiotherapy and manipulation if possible.
    If this condition has been missed as a child and presents
    in later life, formal excision (cranial and caudal ends of
    the sternomastoid muscle, with or without Z-plasty (Z-shaped
    incision)) may be necessary because areas of extremely tight
    fibrosis and sometimes ossification can occur.</p>
<h2>Neurofibroma</h2>
<p>Isolated neurofibromas can be excised although usually the nerve
    will be irrevocably damaged by the excision and will require
    primary nerve repair.</p>
<h2>Schwannoma</h2>
<p>Schwannomas can often be excised while maintaining the integrity
    of the nerve of origin.</p>
<h2>Paraganglioma</h2>
<p>These tumours should be excised because they are at the risk
    of spreading into the cranial cavity. These are extremely
    vascular tumours and as most of them are crossed by the internal
    carotid artery, there is a high level of risk of vascular
    injury</p>
<h2>Carotid body tumours</h2>
<p>Not all carotid body tumours should be removed because most of
    these are benign. However, young healthy patients benefit
    from excision (see Figure 2). Patients who are having symptoms
    but are at high risk for surgery may respond to localised
    radiotherapy.</p>

<h2>Pharyngeal pouch</h2>
<p>There are a range of endoscopic and open treatment procedures
    for the excision of pharyngeal pouches. The profusion of
    different treatments would suggest that no one is ideal but
    most are nowadays managed endoscopically.</p>
