<p>It may be tempting to expect this section to cover in detail
    loss of teeth, from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a>,
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>    or <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">tooth decay</a>, to
    talk about consequences of loss of teeth, prevention by a
    good regime of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    and possibly to discuss <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restoration options</a>.
    However, such aspects of loss of teeth will not be covered
    here (or elsewhere on our website) â€“ these are themes that
    firmly belong, and are dealt with, in the field of dentistry
    rather than oral &amp; maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>Here we refer to developmental abnormalities when we talk about
    missing teeth. In order for healthy teeth to develop (from
    week 6 to 8 of pregnancy for primary (baby) teeth; from week
    20 of pregnancy for permanent teeth), their development has
    to happen at the right time and in synchrony with other growth
    and development of the foetus. If teeth fail to develop at
    the right time of pregnancy, no teeth will develop. The resulting
    conditions are anodontia (absence of teeth) or hypodontia
    (fewer teeth than normal) after birth.</p>
<p>The complete absence of teeth, anodontia, is very rare and usually
    occurs in conjunction with some rare genetic disorder (hypohidrotic
    ectodermal dysplasia) that causes defects to a number of
    tissues that all derive from early embryonic ectoderm (the
    outer embryonal layer).</p>
<p>Hypodontia, the absence of one or more teeth, in contrast is
    one of the most common developmental abnormalities. Permanent
    teeth are more often affected than baby teeth, and hypodontia
    is often combined with smaller than average size of the remaining
    teeth. The most commonly affected teeth are a missing third
    molar (wisdom tooth, 25 to 35 % of the population), followed
    by a missing second premolar or lateral incisor (2 to 3 %
    each). Hypodontia is also associated with some genetic disorders
    such as Down syndrome or Crouzon syndrome (a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies">craniofacial syndrome</a>).</p>
