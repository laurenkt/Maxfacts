<p>Interferons are a group of signalling proteins (cytokines) that
    form an integral part of the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">innate immune system</a>.
    In the broadest sense, the role of interferons is to facilitate,
    modulate and mediate the actions and reactions of the immune
    system by providing inter-cellular communication. The modulating
    role of interferons in the immune system has up- as well
    as down-regulating strands.</p>
<p>The clearest example of the role of interferons is, for example,
    the response to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">infection of a cell by a virus</a>    . A virus-infected cell secretes interferons as an alert
    and warning message to nearby cells to activate their defence
    against viral infection. In addition, some interferons activate
    those cells in the immune system that are responsible for
    eradicating pathogens, such as macrophages, natural killer
    cells and T cells. In addition, interferons also have important
    activating roles in the increased production of some major
    antigens (<a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/immunotherapies/more-info">MHC antigens</a>)
    when generally up-regulating a host’s defence against a pathogen.</p>
<p>The role of interferons is not restricted to their support to
    the immune system in eradicating viral infections. Some interferons
    are also known to support the immune system in recognising
    and eliminating malignant cells. The immune-system mechanisms
    activated in this situation are similar to those at work
    when the immune system has to deal with viral infections.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, virus strands and malignant cell lines have something
    else in common. Alongside the evolution of the host’s immune
    system, getting better at its multiple tasks, also virus
    strands and malignant cell lines evolve and develop strategies
    to escape detection and/or eradication by the immune system.
    These mechanisms include blocking of the signalling role
    of interferons, or the blocking of the actions triggered
    by a particular interferon. Some researchers have referred
    to this co-evolution of host and pathogen as an open-ended
    arms race. Virus species with abilities to escape the detection
    and/or action of the human immune system include the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">Epstein-Barr virus</a>,
    several species of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">herpes virus group</a>    (human cytomegalovirus, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes
    virus), the human papilloma virus, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">HPV</a>    which is associated with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">oropharyngeal malignancies</a>    and some strands of influenza virus.</p>
<p>Synthetic (produced by biochemical methods) interferons are used
    to treat a number of conditions, including multiple sclerosis
    (interferon beta) and hepatitis C, a viral infection of the
    liver that is known to be associated with an increased risk
    to develop liver carcinoma. Combined use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">anti-viral drugs</a>    and interferon alpha has a high rate of success in treating
    hepatitis C and leads to reduced risk of malignancy developing
    on the back of the viral liver infection. A number of different
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">haematological malignancies</a>    have been successfully treated with combination therapies
    including interferon alpha. These conditions include various
    forms of leukaemia and Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment with interferon
    alpha for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin/more-info">recurrent melanoma</a>    has also been reported. A limiting aspect for the use of
    interferons as drugs rests in severe adverse effects from
    systemic use of these agents; this aspect is perhaps not
    too surprising giving the multiple and varied roles of interferons
    in the immune system.</p>
