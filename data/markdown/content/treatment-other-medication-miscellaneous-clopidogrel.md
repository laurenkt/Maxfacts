<p>Clopidogrel is one of several widely prescribed <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiplatelet">antiplatelet medications</a>,
    used to prevent thrombosis (blood clots) in arteries and
    arterioles. A common reason for long-term treatment with
    clopidogrel, often in combination with low-dose <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/aspirin">aspirin</a>,
    is risk reduction for stroke and cardiovascular diseases.

<p>Clopidogrel as depicted in Figure 1 is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">pro-drug</a>    that first needs to be converted to its active form once
    administered. This chemical conversion of clopidogrel (an
    oxidation reaction) requires the action of a number of liver
    enzymes. Accordingly, clopidogrel should not be the first
    choice of antiplatelet medication for people with reduced
    liver function. Also, a type of widely used <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antacid">antacid medications</a>    (proton pump inhibitors, which suppress the production of
    stomach acid) reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel.</p>
<p>Once clopidogrel is converted to its active metabolite by several
    liver enzymes, the active metabolite irreversibly blocks
    a receptor (a protein, P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>) that
    is found on the surface of platelets. P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>    is an important regulator protein in the cascade of reactions
    leading to blood clotting. Blocking P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>    prevents the aggregation of platelets and thus the subsequent
    formation of a blood clot. The resulting, most prominent
    adverse effect of clopidogrel (and other antiplatelet medications)
    is a tendency for excessive <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">bleeding</a>.
    The overall effects of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prasugrel">prasugrel</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/ticagrelor">ticagrelor</a>    are similar to those of clopidogrel, as all three drugs block
    the P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptors on the platelet
    surface. However, there are some subtle but significant differences
    in the underlying biochemical mechanisms.</p>
<p>A tendency for excessive bleeding is obviously relevant for any
    oral and maxillofacial surgical interventions. As the effect
    of a dose of clopidogrel persists for several days, wherever
    possible careful consideration needs to be given to modification
    of antiplatelet medication ahead of surgical interventions
    if excessive bleeding is a risk. This is possible for many
    elective procedures but obviously is not an option for trauma
    and other emergency situations leading to blood loss.</p>
