<p>In this section we revisit the different locations of fractures.
    We give an account of signs &amp; symptoms associated with
    the different fractures, alongside a description of the most
    common methods to investigate these injuries.</p>
<h1 id="mandibular-fractures">Mandibular fractures</h1>
<p>The mandible is a rigid horseshoe of bone with a modified hinge
    joint at either end. It is much more sensitive to lateral
    than frontal impact (it takes around 190 kg frontal impact
    to consistently fracture condyles in cadavers).</p>
<p>Common fracture patterns are shown diagrammatically in Figure
    1.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Relative frequency of sites of
        mandibular fractures</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These percentages change with age, as do the specific types of
    fractures seen between paediatric and adult mandibles and
    dentate and edentulous mandibles.</p>
<p>Intracapsular fractures of the condyle are commoner in childhood
    due a short neck of the ramus, whereas condylar neck fractures
    are commoner in adults. Body fractures of the edentulous
    mandible are commoner than in the dentate mandible as the
    loss of bone height and density after tooth loss is greatest
    at that point.</p>
<p>The condyle is the commonest site of fracture of the mandible
    but the type varies with patient age. They can be intracapsular
    or extracapsular, displaced, undisplaced or dislocated.</p>
<p>Bilateral condylar fractures are classically seen in falls and
    road traffic collisions, in which a large frontal impact
    can occur. The classical ‘Guardsman's fracture’ involves
    fracture of bilateral mandibular condyles with or without
    symphyseal (chin region) fracture, caused by a fall or blow
    to the point of the chin (the term comes from UK royal palace
    guards fainting in the attention stance and landing on their
    chins).</p>
<p>The angle and the parasymphyseal (close to the chin) regions
    are commonly weakened by the presence of third molars in
    various stages of eruption and the canine teeth, respectively.
    These are the most common sites of fracture resulting from
    a lateral impact, more usually caused by a blow.</p>
<p>Combinations of fractures are possible and should be always looked
    for.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms may include pain in the lower jaw, abnormal bite, bleeding
    from the mouth, loose teeth, numb lip, pain in the temporomandibular
    joint region, limited mouth opening, swelling of the floor
    of mouth, and swelling of soft tissues around the mandible.
    Immobility of the mandible is usually in an effort to prevent
    pain, but can be caused by spasm of the muscles of mastication.</p>
<h2>Signs</h2>
<p>Clinical examination of a mandibular fracture may well show,
    depending on the level of fracture displacement and fracture
    pattern, no evidence of disruption of the mandibular body
    and essentially a normal occlusal contact pattern. These
    fractures represent undisplaced hairline fractures of the
    mandible and are confirmed by radiological investigation.
    Examination of a displaced mandibular fracture will show
    disruption of the occlusion and subtle or obviously mobile
    fragments. Sharp bony fragments or fractured teeth may be
    encountered during intraoral examination.</p>
<p>Lingual haematoma (bruising of the tongue) is swelling and bruising
    on the floor of the mouth adjacent to the fracture site.
    Fractures of the ascending ramus and condyle may present
    with no gross clinical signs. The external auditory canal
    needs to be examined for bleeding which may be from a base
    of skull fracture or, more commonly, condylar neck fracture
    connecting with the external ear canal.</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>The combination of plain X-ray radiographs taken from different
    directions gives adequate diagnostic information for most
    mandibular fractures (DPT, dental panoramic tomogram (see
    Figure 2) and posteroanterior radiographs (see Figure 3)).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Dental panoramic tomogram showing
        bilateral mandibular angle fractures. Note the previous
        repair of a parasymphyseal fracture with a single body
        plate.</figcaption>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Posteroanterior radiograph of
        bilateral mandibular angle fractures. Same case as in
        Figure 2.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the patient is unable to stand in the DPT machine, left and
    right lateral oblique mandibular views will give good imaging
    of the body of the mandible.  If the patient has multiple
    complex maxillofacial fractures a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scan</a>    (CT coronal and axial images, with or without 3D reformatting)
    is helpful (see Figure 4). The CT scan will help assess condylar
    fracture position, angulation and any fractured dislocation
    of the condylar head. A CT scan is also useful to image multi-part
    mandibular body fractures.</p>

<h1 id="zygomatic-complex-fractures">Zygomatic complex fractures</h1>
<p>Many patterns of zygomatic complex fractures are possible. The
    classical 'Tripod' fracture involves fractures
    in the frontozygomatic region, infraorbital margin and zygomatic
    arch. Displacement can be marked in one direction, rotated
    or in a combination of movements. Comminuted fracture patterns
    pose a difficult reconstructive challenge and usually occur
    in high impact injuries such as road traffic collisions.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Numbness of the cheek and side of nose on the affected side are
    common. The teeth in the corresponding upper quadrant may
    also feel numb. There may be an altered bite (in extreme
    cases the maxilla is pushed down causing posterior premature
    contacts) or inability to open the mouth (caused by the zygomatic
    arch impacting on the coronoid process), a flattened cheekbone
    and in cases where the orbit is involved, double vision.</p>
<p>Zygomatic fractures with gross displacement can disrupt the orbital
    volume and eye suspensory ligaments leading to hypoglobus
    (lowered eye level) and enophthalmus (a sinking of the eyeball
    into the socket). Globe displacement and trapping or later
    fibrosis of the periorbital fat and muscle can also cause
    diplopia (double vision), usually on upward gaze.</p>
<h2>Signs</h2>
<p>There is facial asymmetry, loss of cheek prominence and indentation
    of the zygomatic arch (dimpling over fracture) although these
    can be masked by swelling. Subconjunctival haemorrhage (see
    Figure 6) suggests direct trauma to the eye or fracture of
    the orbital walls or floor. A complete lateral subconjunctival
    haemorrhage usually indicates a zygomatic fracture. Medial
    subconjunctival haemorrhage implies naso-orbital fracture.
    Eye position needs to be examined from in front, below and
    above because otherwise subtle changes may not be seen if
    swelling is marked.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Black eye showing complete lateral
        subconjunctival haemorrhage.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Palpation reveals facial asymmetry by comparing the normal and
    the injured side. Palpation of the infraorbital margin shows
    a palpable step and discontinuity of the bone. Palpation
    in the upper labial sulcus may reveal a fractured lateral
    maxillary wall, which feels boggy due to the presence of
    a haematoma. Sometimes a sharp laterally overlapping bone
    fragment is felt. Usually the fracture is impacted and therefore
    not mobile.</p>
<p>Testing sensation will reveal loss of nerve function in the distribution
    of the infraorbital nerve. Documentation of the extent of
    loss can be used to gauge nerve recovery in the months after
    trauma by repeat assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Ocular involvement of zygomatico-orbital complex fractures</strong>:
    it is imperative that the visual acuity of the eye is fully
    assessed and recorded at initial presentation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pupillary reaction, consensual reflex and accommodation.</li>
    <li>Visual acuity using a Snellen chart.</li>
    <li>Visual fields.</li>
    <li>Eye movements in an ‘H’ shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any abnormality in acuity mandates discussion with an ophthalmologist
    (see Figure 7).  Abnormalities of eye movement as seen in
    orbital blow out fractures necessitate formal assessment
    of ocular movement (Hess chart) by an orthoptist (specialist
    in eye movement disorders).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Ophthalmic examination of the
        eye during operation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Retrobulbar haemorrhage (bleeding behind the eyeball) is a surgical
    emergency. The classic signs are pain, proptosis (protrusion
    of the eye), dilated pupil, ophthalmoplegia (weakened eye
    muscles) and decreasing visual acuity. Immediate surgical
    intervention to prevent permanent loss of visual acuity is
    necessary. The mechanism behind retrobulbar haemorrhage in
    orbital trauma is believed to be an arterial bleed rather
    than the venous bleed seen in retrobulbar blocks.</p>
<p>Orbital apex compression by oedema may respond to high dose steroids.
    Damage by fragments of bone is not reversible and the prognosis
    is poor.</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>Plain film X-ray radiographs from different angles generally
    give sufficient diagnostic information. Combined they give
    good imaging of the zygomatic complex and can be used to
    determine the level of displacement and fracture pattern.
    Teardrop appearance into the maxillary antrum suggests an
    isolated orbital floor fracture (a 'blow out orbital
    fracture'; see Figure 8). Identification of this type
    of fracture mandates further investigation by a coronal (vertical
    plane view) CT scan and Hess chart test (eye test to assess
    motility of the eye).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> A coronal CT scan showing a ‘blow-out’
        fracture of the orbital floor.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Isolated zygomatic arch fractures are best visualised on a submentovertex
    view (view at base of skull). However, an adequate view of
    the fracture is usually visible on occipitomental views (see
    Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Depressed fracture of the zygomatic
        arch causing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the case of comminuted and badly displaced zygomatico-orbital
    complex fractures the use of coronal and 3D reformatted CT
    scans of the orbit will give the best imaging possible to
    aid planning of fracture repair.</p>
<h1 id="nasal-fractures">Nasal fractures</h1>
<h2>Pattern of nasal fractures</h2>
<p>These were <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">described in the literature</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Plane 1 injury</strong>: the injury lies anterior to
    a line joining the nasal bones and the anterior nasal spine
    and is confined to the cartilaginous nasal skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Plane 2 injury</strong>: injuries that are limited to
    the external nose, not involving the orbital rims.</p>
<p><strong>Plane 3 injury (naso-ethmoid and naso-orbital fractures)</strong>:
    injuries that involve the orbital walls and anterior cranium.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Difficulty in breathing, nosebleeds and appearance are the main
    problems.</p>
<h2>Signs</h2>
<p>Deviation of the septum and nasal bones. Flattening, dislocation
    and obstruction. A septal haematoma should be evacuated (drained)
    early to prevent cartilage necrosis.</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>Plain X-ray films are of limited diagnostic value. Complex fractures
    of naso-ethmoidal bones warrant CT scanning to assess extent
    of injury.</p>
<h1 id="midface-fractures">Midface fractures</h1>
<h2>Patterns of midface fractures</h2>
<p>Patterns of midface fractures are schematically shown in Figure
    10.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Patterns of midface fractures.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Colours in Figure 10 refer to:</p>
<p><strong>Blue</strong> Le Fort I fracture; involves disjunction
    of the left and right maxilla.</p>
<p><strong>Green</strong> Le Fort II fracture; involves fractures
    through the orbital floor and medial orbital wall and lateral
    maxillary wall.</p>
<p><strong>Red</strong> Le Fort III fracture; involves disjunction
    of the mid facial skeleton from the base of skull. The fracture
    is through the pterygoid plates, zygomatic arch, FZ region
    and frontal nasal process bones, superior aspects of medial
    and lateral orbital walls.</p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>These include: pain, swelling, bruising, mobility of the upper
    teeth (feels soft to bite), altered occlusion (usually an
    anterior open bite) and bilateral numbness in the distribution
    of the infraorbital nerve.</p>
<h2>Signs</h2>
<p>The following are often present: swollen face, palpable fractures,
    mobile maxilla (Le Fort I; see Figure 10), mobile maxilla
    and pyriform aperture (Le Fort II; see Figure 10), mobile
    midface with zygoma and separation at frontozygomatic suture
    and base of skull (Le Fort III; see Figure 10). Bilateral
    black eyes (panda eyes); bilateral numbness of the infraorbital
    nerves (Le Fort II). A premature contact of the posterior
    teeth causing anterior open bite can be seen. High impact
    trauma can cause the palate to split down the midline and
    create multipart fractures of all facial bones. Bleeding
    from the nose can be torrential. Major displacement produces
    the classic 'dished in face' appearance.</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>Plain film X-ray radiographs from different angles (occipitomental
    views) give some information, but a much more accurate assessment
    of the extent of the fracture can be obtained from CT scans
    (see Figure 11 for an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> CT scan of a midface fracture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CT scans also allow 3D reformatted images of the facial skeleton
    to be produced as shown in Figure 12.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> Three-dimensional reconstruction
        of a midface fracture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Study models allow the patient’s premorbid occlusion to be assessed
    and are helpful to have in the operating room as they allow
    the surgeon to visualise the correct occlusion prior to fixation.
    They can also be used to construct custom arch bars which
    will be used for intermaxillary fixation during surgery and
    post-operatively. Obtaining impressions on a seriously injured
    patient in the acute phase is, however, not always possible
    or even humane. It may simply be necessary to work with the
    scans and the surgeons understanding of normal anatomy. If
    timing permits models can be generated without the trauma
    of impression taking by milling from 3D CT scanning reformatted
    information. Several commercial organisations offer this
    service.</p>
<h1 id="frontal-bone-fractures-and-frontal-sinus-fractures">Frontal bone fractures and frontal sinus fractures</h1>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>In the acute setting in association with head injury it is an
    incidental finding.</p>
<p>There may be concerns over appearance or recurring bouts of frontal
    headache (due to frontal sinusitis), alterations in the sense
    of smell or nasal discharge.</p>
<h2>Signs</h2>
<p>The fracture involves the anterior wall of the frontal sinus,
    and is often associated with orbital roof fracture, naso-ethmoidal
    fracture, posterior wall fracture and complex cranial-vault
    fracture. A dural tear can lead to a cerebrospinal fluid
    (CSF) rhinorrhoea. A simple test to confirm CSF is to look
    for the presence of glucose on testing paper. Reliable laboratory
    assay testing for CSF specific proteins is also available.</p>
<p>Preoperative assessment is often difficult as there may well
    be a significant head injury.  The patient is often on the
    operating table under the care of the neurosurgical team
    when maxillofacial involvement is requested.</p>
<p>In the case of a nonacute setting, frontal sinus fracture leads
    to cosmetic deformity of the frontal bone. If the frontal
    sinus mucosa is damaged or the ventilation system of the
    frontal sinus is impaired, a history of recurring infection
    may be given.</p>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>Plain X-ray films will give only a vague idea as to the extent
    of the injury. CT scans are mandatory, allowing accurate
    assessment of the fractures; they will not provide any information
    on sinus function but will show fluid collection within the
    sinus. It therefore becomes very difficult to plan treatment
    with any evidence base and individualised ‘best guess’ treatment
    depending on presentation (acute or chronic) and symptoms
    is usual.</p>
<h1 id="craniofacial-fractures">Craniofacial fractures</h1>
<p>Craniofacial injuries may be associated with a significant head
    injury. In cases of complex craniofacial trauma overlying
    soft tissue, skull and brain may be lost (see Figure 13).
    Rotational flaps, free tissue transfers or tissue expansion
    may be needed to provide soft tissue coverage and a healthy
    environment for the rigid protection for the injured brain</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed/figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Craniofacial injuries with associated
        brain and soft tissue loss.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Investigations</h2>
<p>Further detailed imaging investigations for assessment are important.
    It is imperative that the brain is covered to prevent further
    injury. The indications for a CT scan include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Glasgow Coma Scale score lower than 13 when first assessed
        in emergency department.</li>
    <li>Glasgow Coma Scale lower than 15 when assessed in emergency
        department 2 hours after the injury.</li>
    <li>Suspected open or depressed skull fracture.</li>
    <li>Sign of fracture at skull base (haemotympanum, ‘panda’ eyes,
        CSF from ears or nose, Battle’s sign (bruising over the
        back part of the temporal bone)).</li>
    <li>Post-traumatic seizure.</li>
    <li>Focal neurological deficit.</li>
    <li>More than one episode of vomiting.</li>
    <li>Amnesia of events more than 30 minutes before impact.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="injuries-to-the-cervical-spine">Injuries to the cervical spine</h1>
<p>Traditionally plain X-ray radiographs are the initial investigation
    of choice to detect cervical spine injuries. Three views
    of sufficient quality are needed for reliable interpretation.
    With rapid access spiral CT scanning being used much more
    frequently in major trauma centres, plain radiography of
    the cervical spine, although described in <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed">ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support)</a>    has become less common. Definitive interpretation of ligamentous
    injury requires <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>.</p>
