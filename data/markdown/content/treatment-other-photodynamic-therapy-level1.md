<p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the application of a so-called
    photosensitising chemical and subsequent irradiation with
    light of a suitable wavelength to convert the photosensitizer
    into a free radical (an atom/molecule/ion with an unpaired
    electron) which subsequently creates highly reactive oxygen
    radicals in the irradiated tissue, and only there (assuming
    that illumination can be exactly targeted at the diseased
    tissue / tumour).Free oxygen radicals are toxic for living
    cells and effectively kill a cell. PDT attempts to only create
    free radicals in irradiated diseased tissue and thus avoid
    some of the unwanted effects of other conventional, less
    selective treatments.</p>
<p>PDT is quite frequently used for the treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">superficial skin cancers</a>    and other non-malignant skin lesions (such as actinic (‘solar’)
    keratoses or severe cases of acne). PDT is often provided
    as a service by dermatologists and uses a topical photoactive
    substance (ALA), used as a cream and applied to the area
    to be treated.</p>

<p>ALA is a small molecule, 5-aminolevulinic acid which is a precursor
    molecule in the biosynthesis of the actual photosensitiser.</p>
<p>For use in mucosal cancer of the head and neck in the UK PDT
    is only licensed for <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care">palliative use</a>    or when other standard strategies have failed or are not
    possible. PDT then involves an intravenous injection of a
    photosensitizer (temoporfin) about 4 days before illuminating
    the tumour either with superficial or interstitial red light
    laser.</p>

        photosensitizer compound known as temoporfin.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Temoporfin is a molecule with a structure similar to the ring
    structure found in chlorophyll, the chemical used by plants
    in photosynthesis. A whole range of different photosensitizers
    has been developed.</p>
<p>During the entire treatment process the patient is light sensitive,
    the drug being only gradually leached out of the system by
    gradual exposure to artificial and daylight. This is clearly
    a major drawback of the technique. Further problems include
    the calculation of the correct light dose to all aspects
    of the tumour and the safety margin of normal tissue around
    the tumour.</p>
<p>There are dramatic examples of effectiveness of PDT but equally
    there are examples where it fails spectacularly. The evidence
    base is not sufficient for PDT to be internationally recognized
    as a standard treatment alternative in head and neck cancer
    although in the treatment of some other body sites it can
    be considered as a recognized alternative. The British NHS
    has recently stopped paying for mucosal head and neck cancer
    treatment with temoporfin PDT.</p>
