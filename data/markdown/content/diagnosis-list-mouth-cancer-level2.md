<p>Cancer of the oral cavity includes cancer of the lip, tongue,
    gingivae, floor of the mouth and palate. Of these, the commonest
    sites are of the tongue and floor of the mouth.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">Squamous cell carcinoma</a>    forms some 90% of oral cancer. Other types of oral cancer
    include those arising from salivary glands, bone and other
    connective tissues, melanoma and lymphoma.  </p>
<p>There are about 6,200 new cases each year in the UK. The incidence
    of oral cancer is increasing. Globally, cancer of the mouth
    and pharynx is the 6th commonest type of cancer. Although
    less common in the United Kingdom (head and neck cancer is
    12th most common cancer for males), it is the commonest in
    the Indian sub-continent (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh).
    There is a north-south divide in the UK, with higher incidence
    recorded in the northern parts of England, Scotland and Northern
    Ireland compared to the more affluent south.</p>
<p>Oral cancer is more common in males. The vast majority of patients
    with oral cancer are middle aged or older (98% over 40 years
    old). It is, however, increasing in younger patients, in
    particular, non-smokers.  Possible reasons given for this
    rise are the increased consumption of alcohol, and involvement
    of the high risk strains of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">Human Papilloma Virus</a>    (HPV 16 and 18). This is an established cause of a rapid
    increase in oropharyngeal cancer (which is considered a separate
    cancer from oral cancer in some epidemiological data), particularly
    that of the tonsil and base of tongue which are more frequently
    treated primarily non surgically although this has led to
    a different series of post treatment problems.</p>
<h2><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">Head and Neck Cancer Staging</a></h2>
<p>This is a process whereby the extent of the cancer is assessed
    and placed into a category. Staging is used to compare treatment
    and prognosis results across different treatment centres
    and tactics. It involves combining several <a href="/diagnosis/tests">diagnostic tests</a>,
    clinical examination, imaging techniques <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>,
    and/or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a> and
    sometimes <a href="/diagnosis/tests/pet-scans">PET/CT</a>.
     In reality although a cancer is always given a stage using
    the Tumour, Node, Metastases (TNM) system (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">UICC staging</a>)
    the degree of inter and intra centre variability is high
    and treatment intent and approach is always personalised
    to some extent.</p>
<h2><a href="/diagnosis/tests">Diagnostic tests</a></h2>
<p>These include <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>    such as full blood count, urea and electrolytes including
    an EGFR (kidney function) to ensure <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">contrast enhanced scans</a>    can take place, grouping of blood type, liver function tests
    and others. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    of the head and neck area, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>    of the chest and abdomen and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/pet-scans">PET/CT</a>    are regularly carried out. Plain radiographs (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray</a>)
    of the jaws even if no teeth are present are taken (there
    may be buried tooth roots not obvious and if the jaws are
    exposed to radiotherapy treatment surgery afterwards creates
    a risk of a serious condition called <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis</a>.</p>

        of the left mandible caused by extraction of a molar
        tooth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The principle issue here is that any teeth which need to be removed
    before radiotherapy should be removed either at the time
    of surgery or 3 weeks before radiotherapy starts. A <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-pretreatment">restorative dentist</a>    is usually involved.</p>
