<p>The moist suitable treatment option(s) for jaw joint (temporomandibular
    joint; TMJ) disorders obviously depend on the cause of the
    jaw joint problems, but age and other health and further
    considerations need to be taken into account as well. The
    treatment options can be broadly divided into non-surgical
    (appropriate for the majority of cases) and surgical approaches.
    Only a small proportion of cases of TMJ problems benefit
    from surgery. It has been estimated that approximately 5
    % of the population seek treatment and of these approximately
    1 in 20 will undergo some form of surgery.</p>
<h1 id="temporomandibular-joint-pain-dysfunction-syndrome-tmjpds">Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome (TMJPDS)</h1>
<p>Many treatments are available, none of which have been consistently
    shown to be superior to the others. Because TMJPDS is not
    a progressive disease, the main goals of treatment are to
    reduce or eliminate pain, joint noises and to restore normal
    function. This is best achieved when contributing factors
    such as stress, depression, and oral parafunctional habits
    (such as bruxism (grinding teeth)) are also addressed. Psychogenic
    factors are mostly found in conjunction with myofascial pain
    and dysfunction. In such circumstances psychotropic medication
    and psychotherapy may be beneficial.</p>
<h2>Nonsurgical treatment</h2>
<p><strong>Explanation and reassurance</strong> is probably one
    of the most important components of treatment: the cause
    and nature of the disorder are benign.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong> include a soft diet and avoiding
    heavy chewing, wide yawning, chewing gum, and any other activities
    that would cause excessive jaw movement. Any remediable source
    of stress should be identified, and an attempt should be
    made to try and change lifestyle accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Massaging</strong> the affected muscles and applying
    moist heat promotes muscle relaxation and helps soothe aching
    or tired muscles.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous"><strong>Biofeedback techniques</strong></a>    allow a patient to identify muscle overactivity and can be
    linked to learned techniques of muscle relaxation. This is
    not usually available in the hospital environment.</p>
<p><a href="/help/physiotherapy"><strong>Jaw exercises</strong></a>    are indicated in cases of parafunction and may prove useful
    for clicking joints, restricted mouth opening and recurrent
    anterior dislocation of the meniscus.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain"><strong>Analgesia</strong></a>    involves simple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics
    (NSAIDs) and will relieve the pain and certainly reduce inflammation
    around the TMJ. These drugs also have an identifiable effect
    in improving the capacity of the synovial fluid (viscous
    fluid in the joint capsule) to act as a lubricant.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry"><strong>Restorative and prosthetic rehabilitation</strong></a>    provide occlusal balance, posterior support and correct vertical
    discrepancies.</p>
<p>A variety of <strong>occlusal splints</strong> have been suggested
    in the treatment of TMJ dysfunction (see Figure 1).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A lower soft bite raising appliance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="/help/mental-health"><strong>Psychiatric support</strong></a>    should be considered where a psychogenic element may be seen.
    Dosulepin, amitriptyline and nortriptyline have all been
    shown to be useful <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">medications</a>    but close monitoring is essential.</p>
<p>Few, if any, controlled studies exist to support the benefit
    of ‘<strong>alternative therapies’</strong> treatment modalities,
    but in refractory cases (resistant to conventional treatment)
    such possible treatment options include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous">Ultrasound</a> -
        popular with a small evidence base supporting its role
        in symptomatic relief.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/new-developments">Laser (LILT, Low Intensity Laser Treatment)</a>        - no follow up evidence.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/new-developments">Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</a>        - may provide temporary symptomatic relief.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous">Acupuncture</a>        - not widely used for this condition but has a role in
        the management of some people’s chronic pain.</li>
    <li>Relaxation therapy - really an extension of self-help.</li>
    <li>Hypnosis - no real evidence available to support this treatment
        for TMJ disorders but has an established role in chronic
        pain treatment in general.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Surgical treatment</h2>
<p><strong>Injectables</strong> The presence of muscle spasm in
    easily accessible muscles of mastication (particularly the
    masseter and temporalis muscles in patients with myofascial
    pain as the primary symptom) has created interest in overcoming
    this problem. Originally it was felt that this was the main
    benefit of the soft coverage splint (see below) but many
    feel that the presence of this ‘irritant’ between the teeth
    may actually encourage bruxism (grinding of teeth). The widely
    available <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">botulinum alpha toxin</a>    has become increasingly used (without any sound randomised
    controlled clinical trials) in a logical extension of an
    approach based on overcoming painful muscle spasm. Injected
    directly into masseter and/or temporalis muscles leads to
    between 3 and 6 months of enforced decreased muscle activity
    and provides apparently effective analgesia in a group of
    patients.</p>
<p><strong>Other surgical interventions</strong> Around 5 % of patients
    with TMJPDS require surgery. A range of surgical procedures
    are currently used, ranging from arthrocentesis and arthroscopy
    to more complex open joint procedures (see below). These
    surgical procedures are more useful for cases of internal
    derangement with severe chronic pain or significant mechanical
    symptoms.</p>
<h1 id="internal-derangement">Internal derangement</h1>
<p>Initial treatment is essentially along the lines of treatment
    for TMJDS (see above). When there is no response to such
    conservative treatment options and there is a clear internal
    derangement of the meniscus, ‘lysis and lavage’ (a minimally
    invasive procedure that involves irrigation and washing out
    of the joint; using Hartmann’s solution (a mixture of sodium
    chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride and calcium
    chloride dissolved in water)), is often helpful, achieved
    either by <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous">arthroscopy</a>    (see below) or simple joint irrigation (by means of suitably
    placed needles/syringes). If the condition relapses or locking
    of the jaw is a major problem, meniscal placation or eminectomy
    (see below) can be effective surgical treatment options.</p>
<h1 id="osteoarthritis">Osteoarthritis</h1>
<p>Treatment in the first instance is essentially along the lines
    of treatment for TMJDS (see above). However, over time the
    condition may require jaw joint replacement (see below).
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">Steroid</a>    (anti-inflammatory) injections into the joint are useful
    for pain relief, but can damage the articulating surfaces
    in the joint further and may result in accelerated joint
    destruction. Injection of a steroid into the lower jaw joint
    space is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/jaw-joint/detailed/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> An intra-articular injection of
        a steroid into the lower jaw joint space.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="rheumatoid-arthritis">Rheumatoid arthritis</h1>
<p>Treatment in the first instance is essentially along the lines
    of treatment for TMJDS (see above). <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">Steroid</a>    (anti-inflammatory) injections into the joint are useful
    for pain relief, but can damage the articulating surfaces
    in the joint further and may result in accelerated joint
    destruction. Excision of pannus (inflammatory synovial (viscous
    fluid) tissue in rheumatoid joints that covers the articular
    cartilage and progressively destroys the articular cartilage)
    <i>via</i> a standard preauricular (in front of the ear)
    approach can relieve symptoms (see Figure 3). Total condylar
    destruction may necessitate prosthetic joint replacement.</p>

        temporomandibular joint just after suture removal at
        6 days; the site allows an excellent aesthetic result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="infective-arthritis">Infective arthritis</h1>
<p>Treatment includes <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotics</a>,
    and drainage of any pus. Joint lavage (see above) may be
    required. In young patients infective arthritis can result
    in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">ankylosis</a> (see
    below), so aggressive <a href="/help/physiotherapy">physiotherapy</a>    and prolonged follow up are usually necessary.</p>
<h1 id="ankylosis">Ankylosis</h1>
<p>The key to this is identification of at risk cases and prevention.
    When mouth opening is mildly limited, aggressive <a href="/help/physiotherapy">physiotherapy</a>    is required. Mechanical obstruction is addressed by surgery
    to the relevant part (see below).</p>
<p>In adults the joint can be simply excised (gap arthroplasty (restoration
    of the joint)) and an interpositional material placed to
    prevent recurrence of ankylosis. Many such materials exist,
    including temporalis muscle, silastic (silicone rubber) and
    ear cartilage. Alternatively the joint can be completely
    replaced.</p>
<p>In the growing face of young patients, the ankylosed segment
    may need to be excised, but can be left, or replaced with
    a costochondral (rib) graft. The graft will actually grow,
    completely unpredictably (over, under or no growth are equally
    likely). Total joint replacement (see below) using either
    stock or custom prosthesis are increasingly recognized as
    a predictable and long-lasting solution.</p>
<p>In all cases aggressive <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos">mouth opening exercises</a>    are important. In longstanding cases bilateral coronoidectomies
    (removal of the coronoid process of the mandible) may also
    be necessary – as in any joint, if the muscles are not put
    through their full range of motion they will contract and
    fibrose.</p>
<h1 id="splint-therapies">Splint therapies</h1>
<p>A considerable amount of hot air is generated over the value
    of various forms of splints. Most district hospital practices
    restrict themselves to simple lower soft full occlusal coverage
    splints. Dental practitioners with a ‘TMJ interest’ often
    have a range of hard acrylic splints (sometimes the same
    splint with a different name) which they believe in. Nobody
    should undergo any permanent occlusal rehabilitation until
    it has been verified that symptoms resolve with temporary
    ‘ideal’ occlusion using a removable splint.</p>
<h2>Lower soft bite raising appliance</h2>
<p>This is a thermoplastic polyvinyl, full occlusal coverage splint
    (see Figure 1 above).</p>
<p>A lower alginate impression is taken and the splint fitted as
    early as possible. The splint is worn it in the evenings
    and at night. Benefits are usually apparent after 1 – 2 months
    of wear. Quite how it works is a matter of conjecture, there
    being several theories, including a placebo effect. The splint
    may absorb excessive occlusal forces; it may allow repositioning
    of the meniscus, it may restore muscle balance or even vertical
    dimension. Whatever the reason, it eases symptoms in the
    majority of patients. After 6 – 8 months wearing the splint
    gradually has to be terminated.</p>
<h2>Hard acrylic splints</h2>
<p>These require considerably more refined dental techniques for
    manufacture and are multiple in nature, depending on the
    ‘occlusal theory’ they are attempting to correct. They include:
    the localised interference splint which is really just a
    habit breaker; the stabilisation splint which aims to recreate
    an ideal occlusion; the anterior (front) repositioning splint
    which postures the mandible forward; and the anterior bite
    plane which disengages posterior molar contact. The <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">further reading section</a>    has details of these very dental approaches to the treatment
    of TMJ pain/dysfunction. All of these splints can give rise
    to occlusal changes and careful monitoring is necessary.</p>
<p>Edentulous (without teeth) TMJ patients should receive essentially
    the same treatment approach as dentate patients, with the
    obvious <i>proviso</i> that an adequate prosthesis may be
    helpful.</p>
<h1 id="currently-used-tmj-operations">Currently used ‘TMJ operations’</h1>
<h2>Athroscopy and arthrocentesis (washing out synovial fluid from
    the joint capsule)</h2>
<p>This minimally invasive surgical procedure involves a minimum
    of inserting an ‘input and outlet’ needle into the upper
    or lower joint space of the TMJ and irrigating the space
    with Hartman’s solution (see above) or saline. The idea is
    that adhesions are broken down and inflammatory intermediaries
    are washed out.</p>
<p>If a specially designed fibre optic endoscope (an arthroscope)
    is placed into the joint through a small incision instead
    of the input needles, the joint surfaces can be inspected;
    this is known as TMJ arthroscopy (see Figure 4). A number
    of micro-instruments or fibre-optic lasers can be delivered
    in this way.</p>
<p>After the procedure injection with hyaluronic acid (a lubricating
    component of synovial fluid) may be beneficial, but the evidence
    base is incomplete in a similar way to corticosteroids<strong>.</strong></p>

        TMJ space. The outlet part allows irrigation outflow.
        This is the basis of ‘lysis and lavage’.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>‘High condylar shave’</h2>
<p>This means approaching the condyle (the rounded upper end of
    the mandible) by an open operation and resecting and reshaping
    the damaged joint surface (see Figure 5).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/jaw-joint/detailed/figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Exposure of the condyle via a
        preauricular approach for excision of a condylar osteoma
        (a benign bone tumour).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There has been a vogue for preserving the meniscus to allow a
    new lower articulatory surface to form. Current thinking
    is moving in favour of excision of damaged meniscus but a
    new articular fossa is usually implanted in these cases.
    Fat grafting following discectomy rather than fossa replacement
    has a number of advocates, particularly in North America.</p>
<h2>Eminectomy</h2>
<p>Eminectomy, removal of the articular eminence, is a favourite
    surgical approach to recurrent dislocation of the TMJ (see
    Figure 6).</p>
<p>Eminectomy becomes popular for the treatment of internal derangement
    approximately every 5 years. This is then followed by a period
    of condemning it for exactly the same problem.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/jaw-joint/detailed/figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The bone cuts for an eminectomy.
        This is a particularly useful operation for recurrent
        dislocations.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Jaw joint replacement</h2>
<p>Joint replacement is a significant operation for symptomatic
    irreparably damaged joints. Costochondral rib graft (see
    Figure 7) or customised prosthetic joints are used. The unpredictability
    of costochondral rib (a third are stable, a third resorb
    and a third overgrow) and refinements to customised prostheses
    have moved almost all jaw joint replacement for terminal
    joint damage to these devices (see Figure 8).</p>
