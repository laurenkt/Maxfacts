<p>The major salivary glands consist of three sets of paired major
    glands: the two parotid glands (near the angle of the mandible),
    the two submandibular glands (beneath the mandible) and the
    two sublingual glands (beneath the floor of the mouth) and,
    in addition, many minor salivary glands which are scattered
    submucosally (under the lining), throughout the mouth, oropharynx
    (throat), palate and occasionally the nose.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about location and structure of
        the salivary glands, this general information is in our
        section about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The various different salivary glands are prone to a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">variety of conditions and diseases</a>,
    including a huge and bewildering range of salivary neoplasms
    (tumours). The majority (70 – 80 %) of salivary gland lumps,
    masses and tumours are benign (not malignant). The incidence
    of <i>malignant</i> salivary tumours in Europe is 1.2 per
    100,000, so these are very rare.</p>
<p>There are certain situations where there should be an increased
    suspicion of malignancy. Fast growing lumps, pain, sensory
    or motor nerve symptoms are all suspicious of a lump being
    malignant rather than benign. The site of a lump is also
    a risk factor for malignancy; in general</p>
<ul>
    <li>15% of parotid gland tumours are malignant</li>
    <li>35% of submandibular gland tumours are malignant</li>
    <li>50% of minor salivary gland tumours are malignant</li>
    <li>85% of sublingual gland tumours are malignant</li>
</ul>
<p>A parotid mass greater than 4 cm is said to have a higher risk
    of being malignant.</p>
