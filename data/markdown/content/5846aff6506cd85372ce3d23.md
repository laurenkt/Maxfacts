<p>Postoperative problems affecting the skull include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Defects in the skull bone. This is usually after major combined
        procedures with neurosurgeons. There may be a bone defect
        which is planned to be <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">restored later with implanted material</a>        (titanium mesh, PEEK (a polyether ketone polymer), acrylic).
        Generally, in a maxillofacial-only operation only the
        outer table of skull bone will be removed and this is
        often either replaced with synthetic tissue or fills
        in naturally.</li>
    <li>Staples. Staples rather than stitches are used but remain
        in for 10 days and have to be taken out. Washing the
        hair can be a little difficult.</li>
    <li>Scars. If in the hairline, the only evidence is a parting
        of wet hair along the scar line. In male pattern baldness
        the coronal scar (a scar across the top of the head;
        common approach in <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">trauma surgery</a>)
        becomes visible but incisions are hidden in hairlines
        whenever possible. It is very unusual to shave the head
        in maxillofacial operations.</li>
    <li>Headache for a day or two is not unusual. A drain to prevent
        accumulation of blood under the incision is common as
        the scalp is very vascular and bleeds easily.</li>
</ul>
