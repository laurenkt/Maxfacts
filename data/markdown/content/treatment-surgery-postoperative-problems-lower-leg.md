<p>Postoperative problems affecting the lower leg can be remedied
    as follows</p>
<ul>
    <li>A visible scar. The lower leg does not take a skin graft
        as well as the arm so scars are more obvious and prominent.
        Again, scar wound modification with silicone gels, sheets,
        pressure and <a href="/help/physiotherapy">massage</a>        can help. Formal scar revision or re-grafting may be
        necessary in the event of complete skin graft loss.</li>
    <li>Lifting up of the great toe can be limited when a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">fibula flap</a>        has been used. <a href="/help/physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</a>        helps to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the
        degree of neuromuscular impairment.</li>
    <li>Limping to a greater or lesser degree can occur and is greatly
        helped by wearing a solid shoe early on in the recovery
        and rehabilitation phase.</li>
    <li>Altered or absent sensation in the area of surgery may be
        noticeable although this often is not very troublesome,
        counter-irritation treatments as described for the
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/upper-arm">upper arm</a> are useful.</li>
    <li>Complete absence of sensation or sometimes unpleasant
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">altered sensation</a> on the outer surface of the lowest
            part of the leg and the side of the foot, if a
            <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">sural nerve graft</a> has been taken to replace missing
                or damaged nerve elsewhere. Learning to live
                with the loss of sensation is really the most
                important solution to this.</li>
    <li>Very rarely loss of the foot has been reported when a fibula
        flap has been used and the remaining blood vessels to
        the lower leg and foot (the anterior (front) and posterior
        (back) tibial arteries) have been diseased or absent.
        Amputation rehabilitation with a prosthesis is the treatment
        but no-one wants to experience this postoperative problem.</li>
</ul>
