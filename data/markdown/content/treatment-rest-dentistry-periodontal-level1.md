<p>Maintaining high standards of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    at times can be a challenge for some maxillofacial patients,
    for a number of reasons. However, poor oral hygiene is the
    primary cause of periodontal disease (gum disease) and, in
    consequence potential loss of teeth. Understanding this correlation
    can be a powerful motivation to make an effort to maintain
    good oral hygiene, particularly if one is likely to need
    to undergo surgery of the mouth or jaws.</p>
<p>Teeth are held in the jaw bone by tiny ligaments, known as periodontal
    ligaments. These ligaments act like springs around a trampoline,
    connecting the bone and the cementum (outermost layer) of
    the tooth root. This means that teeth are slightly springy,
    moving a very small amount when biting or chewing. Throughout
    the day, bacteria build up on the teeth, forming a film known
    as plaque. If this is not <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">cleaned off properly with a toothbrush</a>,
    it can move underneath the gum line and start damaging the
    ligaments.</p>
<p>At first, the bacteria can make the gums <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflamed</a>,
    leading to bleeding during <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">brushing, flossing and professional cleaning</a>.
    In the early stages, this is reversible and known as gingivitis.
    The damage can be repaired by improving <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>.</p>
<p>If not dealt with at an early stage, gingivitis can progress
    to an irreversible form of the disease known as periodontitis
    (gum disease). Periodontitis is established when the ligament
    is damaged and it forms a ‘pocket’ in which more bacteria
    can collect, causing damage deeper and deeper down the side
    of the tooth. In health, the gap down the side of the tooth
    is less than 2mm, anything more than this could be considered
    as damage, which can be very difficult to access and clean
    with a toothbrush. As more and more ligaments are damaged
    irreversibly, the tooth may become loose and eventually be
    unsalvageable. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">Infection</a>    is also likely in these sites, because bacteria can grow
    and survive there undisturbed. Sometimes there are no symptoms.
    Periodontal disease is the major cause of tooth loss or removal
    in the developed world. A similar process can affect dental
    implants known as <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants/detailed">peri-implantitis</a>.</p>
<p>At this stage, <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">professional cleaning</a>    is essential. The purpose of professional cleaning is to
    access inside the ‘pockets’ with special instruments that
    can reach where a toothbrush at home may not. The bacteria
    are cleaned off the root of the tooth, effectively giving
    a ‘clean slate’ to maintain at home. Whilst the damaged ligaments
    cannot be replaced, professional cleaning (also known as
    root surface debridement) can help slow down the progression
    of the disease. The important thing to understand though,
    is that the key to stopping periodontal disease getting worse
    is <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">daily cleaning at home</a>.
    For some people surgery can be an option to help manage the
    disease.</p>
<p>Factors that increase the risk of getting gum disease include
    <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">smoking</a>, diabetes
    (in fact, most diseases that supress or make the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune system</a>    overactive can manifest as gum disease) and poor oral hygiene.
    Women find their gums bleed and become more swollen during
    pregnancy.</p>
