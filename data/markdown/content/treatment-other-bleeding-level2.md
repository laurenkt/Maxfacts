<h1 id="the-basic-components-of-blood">The basic components of blood</h1>
<p>Blood is a mixture of several basic components, each component
    with specific physiological tasks, considerable overlap of
    regulation mechanisms and some degrees of ‘job sharing’.</p>
<p>The liquid component of blood is <strong>plasma</strong>. It
    makes up a little more than half of the volume of blood and
    mainly consists of water. Water-soluble compounds are dissolved
    in plasma. These chemical components include some <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">vitamins</a>,
    glucose, electrolytes (ions, including Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>,
    Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>,
    HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), some proteins and hormones.
    Some of the water-soluble proteins in plasma help to carry
    non-water-soluble, large molecules (such as cholesterol)
    around the circulatory system. The electrolytes dissolved
    in the plasma act as the buffer system that maintains the
    body pH value near neutral.</p>
<p>The <strong>erythrocytes (red blood cells)</strong> are responsible
    for the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) transport by blood from the
    lungs to all body tissues, in the process known as aerobic
    respiration. The erythrocytes carry out this task by making
    use of a large (typically a tetrameric complex in adults)
    protein, haemoglobin (Figure 1 shows the crucial centre part,
    the ‘working unit’ haem of the molecular haemoglobin arrangement).
    Haemoglobin makes up the majority of the mass of the red
    blood cells and increases the blood’s ability to transport
    oxygen by nearly two orders of magnitude, compared with the
    amount that could be circulated by simply dissolving O<sub>2</sub>    in the plasma alone.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The core unit of the haemoglobin
        protein complex, showing the central Fe<sup>2+</sup>        moiety (the haem group) that allows reversible binding
        of O<sub>2</sub> molecules.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 1 depicts the central Fe<sup>2+</sup> unit held in its
    surrounding porphyrin ring. The Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion is the
    bonding site for reversible attachment of O<sub>2</sub> molecules.
    This attachment happens in the smallest blood vessels (arterioles)
    of the lungs. From there, the blood stream carries the oxygenated
    haemoglobin molecules in the red blood cells to all destinations
    in the body where energy-intensive processes happen. At such
    sites / cells, the O<sub>2</sub> molecules are released from
    the red blood cells and are used in a chemical process to
    make the ‘energy storage molecule’ ATP (adenosine-triphosphate;
    see Figure 2). ATP is used by many energy-intensive processes
    in cells: releasing one of its three phosphate units to form
    ADP (adenosine-diphosphate) releases energy. The waste product
    of this aerobic metabolism powering the body is another gas,
    carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>. Haemoglobin also binds and
    removes this waste product from its production sites. This
    is not in competition with haemoglobin binding O<sub>2</sub>    molecules because CO<sub>2</sub> attaches to the protein
    (globin) part of the haemoglobin complex. Other small molecules,
    notably carbon monoxide, CO, with a very high affinity to
    the haem Fe<sup>2+</sup> site bind competitively with O<sub>2</sub>    and hence are toxic to the body (this is how someone can
    apparently be pink and dead from anoxia). The amount of O<sub>2</sub>    molecules bound to haem is proportional to the partial pressure
    of O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere: the higher the partial
    pressure, the greater the amount of bonded O<sub>2</sub>    molecules. This physical principle forms the basis of
    <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">hyperbaric oxygen therapy, HBO</a>, aiming to improve oxygen
        delivery to body tissues.</p>

<p>Red blood cells are small cells without a nucleus and circulate
    in large numbers in the blood system, with each red blood
    cell carrying of the order of 100 to 200 million haemoglobin
    molecules. These large numbers are necessary to satisfy the
    body’s need for oxygen / energy in all its tissues. Red blood
    cells typically have high turn-over rates and get replaced
    every three to four months. New red blood cells are constantly
    produced in the bone marrow where also the iron from old
    haemoglobin molecules is recycled. The haem units are broken
    down in the liver and are excreted in the bile.</p>
<p>The <strong>leukocytes (white blood cells)</strong> are larger
    cells with a nucleus but do not carry haemoglobin molecules.
    The different types of white blood cells originate from stem
    cells in the bone marrow and they constitute only a small
    fraction of the blood volume. Nevertheless, the different
    types of white blood cells are at the heart of the body’s
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune system</a>    and its response to injury and infection. White blood cells
    can enter the space between cells (interstitial spaces) by
    escaping through capillaries from the intracellular space,
    important to counteract infections in a range of tissues.</p>
<p>The <strong>thrombocytes (platelets)</strong> are small cellular
    fragments originating from some specialised cells (megakaryocytes)
    in the bone marrow. Platelets circulate for only a few days
    before they are processed and removed in the liver and spleen;
    platelets require constant replenishment. The role of platelets
    is essential in blood clotting, both in the initial immediate
    response to bleeding as well as carrying and releasing biochemical
    compounds (so called factors) that are essential in the initiation
    and regulation of blood clotting (see below).</p>

    <p>There is a vast array of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">diagnostic tests for all kinds of blood components</a>,
        some commonly used and some more specialised. A range
        of more common blood tests is described on our detailed
        page about <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>.</p>

<h1 id="the-basic-steps-of-haemostasis-stopping-bleeding">The basic steps of haemostasis (stopping bleeding)</h1>
<p>Haemostasis, stopping bleeding after injury by sealing of the
    injured wall of a blood vessel may be seen as a three-step
    process. The first step (primary haemostasis) is a rapid
    emergency response to stop or reduce further blood loss.
    This is followed by secondary haemostasis, the stage of formation
    of a blood clot that is stable enough to permit healing of
    the wound and the injured blood vessel. The final stage of
    the process, after healing, is called fibrinolysis and is
    the process that removes the then no longer necessary blood
    clot from the healed site of injury. This chronology of events
    is illustrated in the sketch in Figure 3.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-bleeding-level2-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The basic steps of haemostasis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The haemostatic process is essentially maintained by three main
    players: the platelets, the lining (endothelial cells) of
    the blood vessels, and a range of proteins with blood-clotting
    properties. In the absence of injury, the role of endothelial
    cells is actually to prevent the clotting of blood and to
    ensure a smooth blood flow; proteins with blood-clotting
    properties circulate in the blood plasma in non-active form
    but are always ready to be activated in case of injury.</p>
<p><strong>Primary haemostasis</strong> follows injury immediately.
    It involves constriction of the small blood vessel to reduce
    blood flow to the site of injury and the rapid formation
    of a platelet plug to stop haemorrhage. This initial plug
    formation is a process that materials scientists call a phase
    transition, here a transition from the liquid phase to a
    gel phase.</p>
<p>The formation of this initial platelet plug follows the exposure
    of collagen fibres by the injury to the lining (endothelial
    cells) of a blood vessel. In an intact blood vessel the endothelial
    cells prevent blood-clotting and aggregation of platelets
    by the release of a range of chemicals such as heparin-like
    compounds or prostacyclin. After injury, such inhibitor compounds
    for aggregation and/or clotting are no longer released. The
    platelets stick to the collagen-fibre surfaces, then to each
    other, and release chemicals that lead to constriction of
    blood vessels. At this stage the platelets initiate the next
    stage in the process by releasing further chemicals that
    trigger the formation of a more stable blood clot by starting
    the formation of fibrin.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary haemostasis</strong> stabilises and maintains
    haemostasis by supporting the formation of a stable fibrin
    / blood clot (coagulation). This is a much slower process
    than the initial emergency response and formation of a platelet
    plug. It involves a series of chemical reactions, each initiated
    by some messenger molecules (coagulation factors, of which
    approximately ten are currently known to play a major role
    in this process). The coagulation process involves another
    phase transition, the transformation of a soluble protein,
    fibrinogen, to an insoluble form, fibrin. Fibrin forms the
    stable backbone of the clot. This fibrin clot seals and protects
    the injury site of the blood vessel during healing. Fibrin
    formation is the result of a chain of commands to/from inactive
    plasma proteins. The first major step activates prothrombin
    -&gt; thrombin (an enzyme); thrombin in turn triggers the
    activation of soluble fibrinogen -&gt; insoluble fibrin.</p>
<p><strong>Fibrinolysis</strong> is the final stage of this repair
    process. Once the damage to a blood vessel is healed, the
    clot is no longer necessary and is dissolved. The fibrin
    clot is digested by another enzyme, plasmin, into small fragments.
    The inactive form of plasmin, plasminogen, is synthesised
    in the liver and gets incorporated into the fibrin network
    of a clot. There it is converted to its active form, plasmin.
    Eventually, the fibrin clot is replaced by regular, permanent
    scar tissue which consists mainly of collagen.</p>
<p>Another basic mechanism to stop haemorrhage is <strong>equalising of the pressure inside and outside of an injured blood vessel</strong>.
    Bleeding continues as long as the damaged site remains open
    and the pressure inside the blood vessel is higher than that
    outside. The initial reaction to reduce the blood flow to
    the injured site by constriction of the (small) supply vessels
    reduces the intravascular pressure. The external pressure
    may be increased by blood that is trapped in the vicinity
    of the site of injury (haematoma). It may, of course, be
    simulated by direct pressure on a wound – the mainstay of
    first aid.</p>
<p>The relative importance of the various mechanisms to stop bleeding
    depends on the site and the scale of a vascular injury. Bleeding
    from small vessels is usually stopped by the formation of
    a platelet plug. Stopping bleeding from a larger vessel usually
    requires the formation of a blood/fibrin clot. Blood loss
    following injury to the largest vessels, in particular arteries,
    is usually not stopped by the aggregation of platelets and
    the formation of a blood clot. Here a massive drop in pressure
    (shock) is the mechanism to arrest blood loss. Unfortunately,
    that equates to failure of adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery
    at a cellular level – the metabolic consequence of hypovolaemic
    shock. This precipitates systemic dysfunction unless rapidly
    reversed.</p>
<p>The opportunities and causes for disturbances and malfunctions
    of the blood clotting process at every stage are numerous.
    There can be over- as well under-activities. Most of the
    resulting conditions, signs and symptoms can be successfully
    managed by a range of treatment options. Since all these
    aspects of bleeding are relevant in all areas of surgery,
    oral &amp; maxillofacial surgery included, we next discuss
    on the following page malfunctions and pathologies of the
    various blood clotting processes, possible remedies and management
    (including surgical interventions), and interference with
    surgery and/or recovery from surgery.</p>
