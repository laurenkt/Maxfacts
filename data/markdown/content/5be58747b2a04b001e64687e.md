<p>In tumour surgery, it is highly desirable to have rapid and reliable
    ways to characterise surgical margins as free (or otherwise)
    of malignant tissue. Such evaluation methods should ideally
    work in real-time applications, preferably in the operating
    theatre and without additional need for sample preparation.
    The traditional way to obtain rapid information about tissue
    characteristics during surgery is a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">frozen section</a>,
    where a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>    is taken, immediately frozen and investigated in the histology
    laboratory. Unfortunately, this method is notoriously inaccurate.
    It is, therefore, not surprising that alternative methods
    for rapid tissue characterisation haven been / are being
    explored. For example, some early promising results have
    been reported for the use of a specific form of <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/mass-spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a>    in breast surgery; the method is currently (2019) being explored
    for applications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>Of the many, well-established analytical techniques a particular
    form of vibrational spectroscopy holds promise as a suitable
    tool for rapid tissue characterisation: Raman spectroscopy.
    Some initial applications, with promising early results have
    been reported in the literature, most of it in pre-clinical
    settings but some already transitioning to clinical use.
    Below we give a brief outline of the working principles of
    Raman spectroscopy, followed by a short discussion of the
    favourable aspects of Raman spectroscopy as a potential future
    real-time tissue-evaluation tool.</p>
<p>When thinking about molecules and vibrational spectroscopy, it
    is useful to take a purely mechanical view of a molecule.
    In this mechanical model, an atom is represented by a mass;
    chemical bonds are represented by springs of different length
    and stiffness, connecting the ‘atoms.’ Such a mechanical
    molecule would have a characteristic vibrational behaviour,
    according to its construction from different masses and springs
    in a particular configuration. This would be different for
    each different kind of mechanical molecule. In fact, this
    mechanical view of molecules translates rather well to the
    vibrational characteristics of real molecules, to what is
    called a bond strength in chemistry (where strong chemical
    bonds correspond to stiff springs, and weaker chemical bonds
    to softer springs), and to ‘fingerprinting’ specific molecules
    according to their vibrational spectra.</p>
<p>Raman spectroscopy (named after the physicist C.V. Raman who
    discovered the effect and for which he was awarded the physics
    Nobel prize in 1930) is a variant of vibrational spectroscopy.
    In Raman spectroscopy, the vibrational characteristics (the
    ‘vibrational states’) of molecules are interrogated by shining
    monochromatic light onto the sample (Figure 1).</p>

        experiment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The monochromatic light is typically provided by a <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">laser</a>,
    the wavelength of the light / the photons (particles of light)
    is usually in the infrared to ultraviolet range of electromagnetic
    radiation. When the incoming light hits the sample, most
    of the light is scattered without any further interaction
    with the sample. This bouncing of the incoming light off
    the sample is known as elastic scattering, it preserves the
    wavelength of the incoming light. The outgoing light after
    elastic scattering has the same wavelength as the incoming
    light as no energy is exchanged between the sample and the
    light.</p>
<p>A small portion of the incoming light, however, does interact
    with the vibrational levels of the sample under investigation.
    This effect is known as inelastic scattering and forms the
    basis of Raman spectroscopy. This interaction between the
    incoming light and the sample may promote the molecule(s)
    to a higher vibrational state (the most common type of interaction)
    by ‘borrowing’ the appropriate amount of energy from the
    incoming laser light. This obviously reduces the energy of
    the light, and the emitted light in that case will have a
    wavelength longer than that of the incoming light. The interaction
    / energy transfer may rarely also work the other way round,
    when a molecule is already in a higher vibrational state
    and, on returning to its lower vibrational state, ‘donates’
    the corresponding amount of energy to the incoming light.
    In that case, the emitted light will have a shorter wavelength
    than the incoming light / photons (Figure 2).</p>

        in Raman spectroscopy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since only a small proportion of the outgoing light will have
    undergone inelastic scattering, it is technically important
    at the detector stage (Figure 1) to filter out all the light
    that has the same wavelength as the incoming light. After
    passing this wavelength filter, only the vibrational fingerprint
    of the investigated sample following wavelength changes due
    to inelastic scattering is recorded, in the form of a graph.</p>
<p>Raman spectroscopy is a highly suitable form of vibrational spectroscopy
    for the investigation of biological materials where water
    is ubiquitous. The Raman effect is influenced very little
    by the presence of water (much in contrast to, for example,
    traditional infrared spectroscopy where water molecules strongly
    absorb the irradiation beam). It is essentially a non-destructive
    technique. Another distinct advantage is that it takes very
    little time to acquire a Raman spectrum and there is no need
    to prepare the sample. Thus, the technique can be used <i>in situ</i>    (in addition to measurements on contained samples) and further
    lends itself to localised spectroscopy and even microscopy
    approaches: scattering data can be acquired from very small
    volumes of less than 1 <i>µ</i>m diameter. The experimental
    set-up as summarised in Figure 1 is simple and consists of
    small units, and thus is easy to accommodate, for example
    in an operating theatre.</p>
<p>In many analytical applications of Raman spectroscopy and other
    spectroscopies, the ‘spectrum / graph’ is the final output.
    In analytical applications of vibrational spectroscopies
    this is typically a vibrational fingerprint of a particular
    compound, material or other sample. However, if the aim is
    to use the method as a tool to distinguish healthy from unhealthy
    tissue, then this spectrum output only represents the penultimate
    step in the procedure.</p>
<p>Tissue evaluation requires the observed graph to be compared
    to graphs in a data base, covering a suitable range of graphs
    obtained from healthy and diseased tissues. Not only does
    such a data base have to be composed of a fairly large number
    of high-quality entries to allow a statistically meaningful
    comparison, it is also required that there is/are uniquely
    identified marker(s) / characteristic(s) in the graphs to
    distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue. For example,
    if <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/mass-spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a>    is used for the evaluation of surgical margins in breast
    surgery, the phospholipid profiles in healthy and diseased
    tissue provide this distinction.</p>
<p>One possibility to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue
    in <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer">oral cancer surgery</a>    by means of Raman spectroscopy is the different water content
    of healthy (low) and malignant (high) tissue. For example,
    measurements on freshly excised <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">oral squamous cell carcinoma</a>    (the most common form of oral cancer) of the tongue were
    compared with the results of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">traditionally stained biopsy preparations</a>    and were found to be 99 % sensitive and 92 % specific. A
    number of studies compare Raman spectroscopy and microscopy
    results for different solid tumours with <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">H&amp;E stained biopsies</a>,
    with generally very good agreement. Such assessments have
    been carried out for soft and hard tissue resections in surgery
    of oral malignancies. There are numerous initial studies
    of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> applications of Raman
    spectroscopy for a number of different applications in oncological
    surgery. Most of these studies have in common that they provide
    encouraging results for the establishment of a novel real-time
    assessment of surgical margins. The majority of these studies
    further have in common that they are mostly in a pre-clinical
    or trial stage, and that the most important next step in
    the development of the methodology is the establishment of
    robust algorithmic methods for data evaluation and the building
    of meaningful data bases. This is likely to take several,
    if not many, years from now (2019). Some such developments
    may well benefit from <a href="/treatment-other new-developments-ai">learning algorithms and other forms of artificial intelligence</a>.
    A particularly worthwhile direction to pursue on the methodology
    side, other than algorithmic considerations, may be in the
    area of <i>in si</i>tu / <i>in vivo</i> tissue evaluation
    before resection; this may become possible by using fibre
    optics in a miniaturised experimental set up.</p>
