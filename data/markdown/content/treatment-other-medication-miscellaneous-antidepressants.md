<p>Antidepressants are medicinal drugs typically prescribed in the
    treatment of mental health disorders, such as in the treatment
    for depression, depressive episodes or anxiety disorders.
    A maxillofacial clinic is not the place for treatment of
    mental health disorders but some of the antidepressant agents
    have a role in a maxillofacial context in their capacity
    to alleviate some forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">chronic pain conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst antidepressants are not designed as analgesics (painkillers),
    they can be effective in the treatment of some forms of chronic
    pain. Their analgesic effects differ from person to person,
    and from condition to condition, sometimes these medications
    may have no beneficial effect on pain conditions at all â€“
    but it is worthwhile to explore as a potential treatment
    option for some of these difficult-to-treat chronic pain
    conditions. If antidepressants are effective, only a low
    dosage is needed in their role as analgesics for the treatment
    of <a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies/more-info">neuropathic pain</a>,
    a much lower dosage than is typically required for the treatment
    of mental health disorders.</p>
<p>There is a vast variety of drugs that fall under the antidepressant
    heading, all of which are prescribed for different purposes
    in a mental health context, and all of which have different
    mechanisms of action. For the purposes of pain control in
    the maxillofacial remit, we only look at a very small number
    of these drugs.</p>
<p>One antidepressant drug that is used as an analgesic (or as a
    co-analgesic, combined with other drugs such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiepileptics">antiepileptic agents</a>    is fluoxetine. Fluoxetine is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor</a>,
    blocking serotonin (a neurotransmitter) re-uptake in synapses
    in the central nervous system. This allows serotonin to stay
    in the synapse for longer and have a greater prolonged inhibitory
    effect on the post-synaptic receptor, which can block pain
    signals. In pain control, antidepressants with a slightly
    stimulant effect such as fluoxetine, are often combined with
    neuroleptics (antipsychotic drugs with a sedative action)
    such as phenothiazine (Figure 1). This combination has been
    shown to be more powerful as an analgesic than an antidepressant
    drug alone.</p>

<p>Amitriptyline is a different type of antidepressant agent with
    a documented history as a low-dose treatment for some forms
    of neuropathic pain and in the prevention of migraines and
    tension headaches. Recent analyses show that, whilst amitriptyline
    is effective as an analgesic only in a minority of cases,
    in those cases it provides a very good way to manage neuropathic
    pain conditions. Amitriptyline belongs to a class of chemicals,
    tricyclic (three-ring) compounds (Figure 2), a range of which
    have been synthesized 50 years ago when initially the antidepressant
    properties of this class of chemicals were discovered.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The molecular structures of amitriptyline
        and nortriptyline.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Amitriptyline interacts with many different receptors on nerve
    cells, including <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">opioid</a>    and histamine receptor sites. In addition, amitriptyline
    is known to have some blocking effects on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">sodium and potassium ion channels</a>    in the central nervous system, as well as reducing the re-uptake
    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">noradrenaline</a>    (see below). All of these mechanisms are thought to contribute
    to the analgesic effects of amitriptyline (and other tricyclic
    antidepressants) as they all play a role in chronic neuropathic
    pain conditions.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline has sedative properties. It is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">pro-drug</a>    and is metabolised to nortriptyline (Figure 2). The re-uptake
    of both serotonin and noradrenaline (neurotransmitters) at
    different types of neurons is hindered by nortriptyline.
    This blocking effect is thought to be the reason for the
    antidepressant properties of amitriptyline. The sedative
    effects in low-dose treatment of chronic pain have the added
    advantage of improving sleep when taken at night (in fact,
    amitriptyline is sometimes prescribed for the treatment of
    insomnia).</p>
<p>The many different <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">mechanisms of action</a>    of antidepressants are not fully understood. Generally, they
    are thought to act on multiple receptors of nerve cells and
    have multiple effects. Some of these effects are thought
    to be responsible for analgesic effects. Antidepressants
    have been shown to provide good pain relief in particular
    for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">allodynia</a>    (pain response from stimuli which do not normally provoke
    a pain sensation).</p>
<p>Long-term use of antidepressants does carry a small but significant
    risk of gastrointestinal or post-surgical bleeding.</p>
