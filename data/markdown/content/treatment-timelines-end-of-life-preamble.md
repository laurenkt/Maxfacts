<p>Death is a part of life. If we exclude a discussion of treatment
    and other considerations in the management of terminal conditions
    and end-of-life situations, we would not do justice to the
    motto of maxfacts: to provide information on <i>all</i> aspects
    of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Furthermore, we think
    that it is unhelpful for all, clinicians, patients, friends,
    carers alike to avoid the topic. This is something that has
    been emphasised by the Royal College of Physicians (UK) in
    2018. It is important to recognise that the end of life is
    not a lost battle but a natural consequence of life.</p>
<p>On purely statistical grounds: for the vast majority of people
    it will not be an oral or maxillofacial condition that will
    terminate their life. It is far more likely to die from cardiovascular
    disease, stroke, some forms of dementia, diabetes, or malignancies
    other than head &amp; neck cancers. However, some will die
    from oral and maxillofacial conditions, including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">head &amp; neck malignancies</a>,
    severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    and major <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage/detailed">trauma</a>.
    Â </p>
<p>With this background, our section about palliative and end-of-life
    care will start with some brief and general outline of palliative
    care considerations on the <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care/getting-started">following page</a>.
    There is a more <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care/more-info">clinical discussion</a>    of the main terminal conditions and causes of death in oral
    and maxillofacial surgery. Finally, we <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care/detailed">share our own views and opinions</a>    about a topic that should not be a taboo.</p>
