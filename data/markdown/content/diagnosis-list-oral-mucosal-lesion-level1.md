<p>Lesions of the mucosa (lining) of the mouth are common and diverse,
    including ulcers, blisters and patches which are of unusual
    colour or texture.</p>
<p>Many of the lesions of the oral cavity have straightforward innocent
    causes such as repeated minor trauma. Underlying health conditions
    such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">autoimmune diseases</a>,
    skin conditions or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    (bacterial, fungal, viral) can be related to such lesions.
    Oral lesions may be the first signs and symptoms of underlying
    systemic diseases. Some medications and some <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/overview">recreational drugs</a>    can cause oral ulcerations.</p>
<p>Some non-healing mouth ulcers or persistent patches may be more
    serious. Some white, red or speckled <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">patches</a>    or ulcers that persisted for three weeks or longer need thorough
    investigations as these may be lesions with a tendency to
    malignant transformation, or may be a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">mouth cancer</a>.
    Where a detailed <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">examination</a>    are unable to confirm the harmless nature of a lesion and/or
    firmly exclude any malignancy, further investigations such
    as <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>    may need to be arranged.</p>
