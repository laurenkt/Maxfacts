<p>Anaesthesia is the process by which <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">drugs</a>    are given to reduce and prevent the sensation of pain caused
    by tissue damage (for example during surgery).</p>
<p>There are three broad categories of anaesthesia used in maxillofacial
    surgery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>local anaesthesia</li>
    <li>local anaesthesia with sedation</li>
    <li>general anaesthesia</li>
</ul>
<p>In some instances, the surgeon will give only local anaesthetic
    so the patient remains awake but all pain is prevented during
    the surgery.</p>
<p>In other instances, the patient will be asleep and unaware (general
    anaesthesia) but the operated area will be numb when they
    wake up because the surgeon has added to the anaesthetic
    by injecting local anaesthetic to the site of the operation.</p>
<p>Sedation relaxes the patient and they may forget the event but
    does not make them go to sleep.</p>
