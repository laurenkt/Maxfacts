<h1 id="dry-mouth-treatment-by-medication">Dry-mouth treatment by medication</h1>
<p>Dry mouth is usually a chronic complaint which is often not helped
    by medications or treatments. Pharmaceuticals are usually
    mimics of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia/detailed">parasympathetic transmitter acetylcholine</a>    and so while they will cause an increase in salivation they
    can also cause other effects such as sweating, nausea and
    increased urinary flow. Pilocarpine, bethanechol and cevimeline
    are three of the more commonly used such medications (see
    Figure 1).</p>

        (top), bethanechol (middle) and cevimeline (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These medications (sialogogues) have common and serious unwanted
    effects because the receptors they act on to achieve the
    wanted effect (increased salivation) are not specific to
    the salivary glands. In fact, pilocarpine is a drug that
    has been known for over 100 years and is also used (in the
    form of topical preparations) to treat eye conditions (glaucoma),
    where excessive production of saliva and sweat have to be
    considered as unwanted effects. The number of remaining functional
    acinar (secreting) cells in damaged salivary glands determines
    how well these drugs can stimulate salivation rates.</p>
<p>Treatments in the form of artificial salivas are readily available
    from pharmacists but are often too transient to be of great
    benefit. It is important to look for preparations which contain
    fluoride ions and are not acidic (some artifical salivas
    are acidic).</p>
<p>Anything which stimulates the sense of taste will cause an increase
    in salivary flow but care is needed to avoid cariogenic foods
    (sugar in particular; also beware of hidden sugar in low
    fat and other highly processed foods, they all contain added
    sugar, sometimes in substantial quantities). So sugar-free
    mints / sweets can be useful. Maintaining hydration by drinking
    water would appear to be essential although conversely drinking
    water can exacerbate dry mouth symptoms (because drinking
    lots of water or continually sipping water, washes away any
    precious remaining saliva production). Chewing sugar-free
    gum can also increase salivary flow and relieve dry mouth
    to a certain extent. Other ideas and alternatives to keep
    the mouth moist and stay hydrated can be found in our detailed
    section about <a href="/help/oral-food/practical-tips">practical tips around oral food intake</a>.</p>
<p>If the occurrence of a dry mouth has coincided with the starting
    of a new medication, that medication is likely to be the
    cause. A discussion with the prescribing clinician may allow
    an alternative drug treatment that doesn’t cause xerostomia.</p>
<h1 id="attempts-to-avoid-xerostomia-as-a-long-term-effect-of-radiotherapy">Attempts to avoid xerostomia as a long-term effect of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a></h1>
<p>With a view to reducing the long-term adverse effects of high-energy
    radiation delivered to healthy tissues of the head &amp;
    neck region (such as xerostomia, but also including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis</a>),
    much effort has been devoted to develop more selective irradiation
    schemes. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (<strong>IMRT</strong>)
    irradiation schemes have the potential to spare crucial structures
    (for example, salivary glands) from exposure to high radiation
    doses while being able to better shape the high-level irradiation
    to the target volume. These modulated irradiation schemes
    have become standard radiotherapy treatment approaches over
    the past 10 to 15 years. IMRT schemes have been shown to
    reduce long-term problems with xerostomia. However, wider
    structures that would not have been exposed to high-energy
    radiation in conventional irradiation schemes (for example,
    front of mouth and tip of tongue) in IMRT schemes are exposed
    to lower-level irradiation (‘dose bath’).</p>
<p>In some selected circumstances it may make sense to temporarily
    surgically <strong>relocate the submandibular salivary gland</strong>    to the submental space (under the chin), outside the planned
    irradiation field. It has been shown that this method prevents
    radiation-induced xerostomia and preserves the function of
    the gland in the majority of people treated in this way.
    However, this method is only feasible for a small subsection
    of head &amp; neck cancer cases and thus is rarely used,
    having only a practical role in laryngeal cancer.</p>
<p>Some customised mouth-opening devices (<strong>intraoral stents</strong>)
    have been shown to reduce radiation damage to healthy tissue
    simply by, for example, increasing the distance between upper
    (maxilla) and lower jaw (mandible), as well as immobilising
    the mandible for the duration of an irradiation session.
    The exact degree of benefit from such otherwise easy to manufacture
    devices remains to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Many substances have been, and continue to be, researched as
    candidates to act as <strong>‘protectants’</strong>, that
    is as chemical or biochemical agents that help to prevent
    or reduce radiation damage to healthy cells and tissues in
    general, including the reduction of severity and duration
    of xerostomia resulting from head &amp; neck radiotherapy
    schemes. Of the many such agents investigated, so far only
    amistofine (see Figure 2) has some track-record as a promising
    protectant. It has been shown that amistofine does reduce
    severity of xerostomia during radiotherapy treatment periods;
    the long-term protective effects are less clear. The fact
    that amistofine is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed">prodrug</a>    which relies on a specific hydrolysis mechanism for activation
    not likely to be active in malignant cell lines, makes this
    chemical the currently most promising candidate as a protective
    agent. Trials have shown that amistofine does not compromise
    local tumour control by radiotherapy. However, amistofine
    causes severe other unwanted effects and its use requires
    careful clinical monitoring.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-xerostomia-level2-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Amistofine; the prodrug needs
        to be hydrolysed <em>in situ</em> in order to obtain
        the active form of the drug to protect healthy cells
        from radiation damage.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other biochemical agents are being investigated for similar radiation-protection
    purposes (for example, keratinocyte growth factor (palifermin))
    in the hope to find drug candidates with fewer or less severe
    unwanted effects while maintaining a high level of cell-protection
    in healthy tissues. These searches and suggestions include
    some not entirely convincing examples, with little or no
    supporting evidence. The major hurdle and <i>caveat</i> in
    these investigations is to ensure that the agent i) <i>does</i>    protect healthy cell lines, and ii) that it <i>solely</i>    protects healthy cell lines from radiation damage but not
    malignant cell lines. For the time being, amistofine is the
    only agent for which some conclusive evidence exists.</p>
<p>On the pre-clinical research front, autologous stem cell transplantation
    has been proposed as a prevention of long-term xerostomia
    caused by radiation damage to salivary glands. In animal
    models, stem cells from submandibular and parotid glands
    were collected prior to irradiation. When transplanted back
    into salivary glands after the radiotherapy cycle, these
    stem cells differentiated into functional salivary gland
    cells and regenerated salivary-gland function. If these pre-clinical
    studies can be translated to clinical practice, this approach
    would hold promise and would not be marred by the many and
    serious unwanted effects of the other, current prevention
    strategies.</p>
<h1 id="management-of-and-self-help-for-dry-mouth">Management of (and self-help for) dry mouth</h1>
<p>Whatever the cause of dry mouth, <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">rigorous oral health regimes</a>    are necessary to prevent the rapid progression of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">caries</a>.
    Saliva is the <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">natural protector of teeth from decay</a>.
    A pro-active dental-care regimen, especially involving dental
    hygienists, brushing morning and night with a fluoride containing
    toothpaste (see our <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">video demonstrations</a>),
    avoiding sugary foods, always having a glass of water with
    any meals and snacks (more for rinsing the mouth to remove
    some minor food debris, than for helping with swallowing)
    are sensible precautions.</p>
<p>As well as <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental caries</a>,
    dental erosion is increased in dry mouth. Erosion of dental
    enamel is normally prevented by the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>    ions in saliva, in the absence of the <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">sticky protecting type of saliva</a>,
    teeth are more vulnerable to the loss of calcium ions, leading
    to erosion. So acidic foods are best avoided or should at
    least be consumed with water. Changes in <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste</a>    and palatability of foods may occur with dry mouth to such
    an extent that <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">malnutrition</a>    or dehydration may occur. These consequences of dry-mouth
    problems are usually exacerbated by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">difficulties with swallowing</a>    due to lack of the <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">lubricating properties of saliva</a>.</p>
