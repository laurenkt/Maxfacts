<p>Before discussing the various <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/detailed">types and locations of defects</a>    and options for their reconstruction in maxillofacial surgery,
    we examine the various types of grafts and flaps most commonly
    used.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about donor-site anatomy, especially
        for free flaps, our section on <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>        includes a brief excursion to donor-site anatomy.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="grafts">Grafts</h1>
<p>A tissue graft involves complete separation from the donor site
    and subsequent transfer to the recipient site.</p>
<p>A graft can consist of</p>
<ul>
    <li>skin</li>
    <li>mucosa</li>
    <li>fascia</li>
    <li>bone</li>
    <li>cartilage</li>
    <li>nerve.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skin grafts</h2>
<p>Skin grafts can be harvested as</p>
<ul>
    <li>split-thickness grafts (all of the epidermis (outer layer
        of skin) and part of the dermis (tissue layer beneath
        epidermis)) – the donor site will heal / resurface by
        epidermal cell migration (Figure 1);</li>
    <li>full-thickness grafts (the epidermis and dermis layers) –
        the donor site needs to be closed because no epidermal
        structure remains to resurface, and if left, the donor
        site will heal slowly with a contracted scar.</li>
</ul>

        graft with a Watson knife.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Skin grafting is a simple and popular soft tissue reconstructive
    technique. It requires a healthy bed to take. The donor site
    is dictated by factors such as size of graft required, appearance
    of donor site scar and harvested tissue, presence of absence
    of hair, access during surgery and mobility of the patient
    after surgery. Split-thickness grafts can provide viable
    reconstruction of the tongue in some cases (Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Left: a split-thickness skin graft
        repairing a post-excisional defect on the lateral border
        (side) of the tongue; right: the mobility of the tongue
        is maintained.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Split-thickness donor sites include the upper and lower limbs
    as well as the abdomen. Grafts can be harvested manually
    with a specialised knife (adjustable for thickness of graft)
    or an electric dermatome. The donor site requires dressing
    changes over a period of weeks; more pain can be experienced
    at the donor site than at the recipient site. The graft can
    also be paler in appearance (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Left: the aesthetic result of
        a split-thickness graft on the face is often unfavourable,
        and (right) cosmetic camouflage may be needed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Full thickness grafts for the face are usually harvested from
    the face (preauricular, postauricular, upper eyelid or nasolabial
    fold), neck or abdomen. The choice of donor site depends
    on the colour match, the size required and the patient’s
    and surgeon’s preferences. The donor site is primarily closed,
    leaving a linear scar preferably in an inconspicuous site.</p>
<p>Both split-thickness and full-thickness skin grafts are useful
    in repairing superficial oral and facial defects. The full-thickness
    skin graft is particularly effective in nasal, eyelid and
    forehead defects (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The results of a full-thickness
        skin graft into a small excision defect of the scalp
        (top left and top right) and the result after two months
        (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Split-thickness skin grafts can be meshed (perforated with holes
    and stretched to increase the graft size) to cover large
    defects. In some instances (for example, surplus skin graft,
    or infected recipient site), placement of the skin graft
    can be delayed for up to three weeks provided the harvested
    skin graft is stored at 4°C and moistened with saline on
    paraffin gauze.</p>
<p>Split-thickness skin grafts take more readily (thinner tissue
    requires less vascular ingrowth) but has a poorer outcome
    (tendency to contract, with a thinner characterless look)
    than full-thickness skin grafts (Figure 5). The success rate
    is generally high. Failure is usually the result of mobility
    of the graft, haematoma or infection.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The good aesthetic result from
        full-thickness skin grafting.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Mucosal grafts</h2>
<p>These grafts can be harvested from the buccal mucosa (cheek)
    with primary closure, or the palatal mucosa (will re-epithelialize).
    The advantages of using a mucosal graft to reconstruct oral
    defects are a good tissue match and the ease of harvesting
    in the same operative field. However, it introduces a scar
    in the same area and may further impair function. Mucosal
    grafts are useful for gingival (gum) or alveolar repairs,
    and as inner lining in eyelid repairs.</p>
<h2>Fascial grafts</h2>
<p>The fascia is a strong band of connective tissue. It can be harvested
    from the temporalis fascia or from the fascia lata in the
    thigh (Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Fascia, in this case fascia lata
        from the thigh, can be taken as robust graft for internal
        support.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Uses in the head and neck region include dural repair in <a href="/treatment/surgery/craniofacial-anomalies">craniofacial procedures</a>    and as facial slings (as part of static facial reanimation
    in the treatment of a paralysed face. A fascial graft will
    contract and scar considerably if it is used in the mouth
    or on the skin surface.</p>
<h2>Bone grafts</h2>
<p>Bone grafts can be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cancellous (medullary (middle section) component, which is
        mushy but rich in bone-forming components;</li>
    <li>cortical (hard structure useful for supporting role);</li>
    <li>corticocancellous block (Figure 7).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Corticocancellous bone graft.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bone grafting is an established and relatively straightforward
    hard tissue reconstructive technique. A bone graft is used
    to provide a rigid structure (form, contour and mechanical
    support) and osteogenic (bone growth) potential (Figure 8).
    Osteogenic potential occurs by providing a scaffolding structure
    (osteoconduction role), which is later replaced by the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">ingrowth of new bone</a>. This active process is thought
        to take place using the grafted bone’s osteogenic / osteoinductive
        potential, in particular the bone morphogenic proteins
        (group of proteins that initiate bone formation and activate
        the bone-forming cells (osteoblasts)). There is much
        active research ongoing in the fields of bone tissue
        engineering, bone synthesis, prelamination, bone growth
        factors.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Top: mandibular reconstruction
        with shaped corticocancellous bone, the graft will survive
        if it is immobilised in a well-vascularised environment;
        bottom: inset free corticocancellous bone graft with
        reconstruction plate.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bone grafts can be used to fill bone cavities, augment bone deficient
    areas or replace and reconstruct bony loss (see Figure 8).
    Cancellous bone grafts are commonly used in <a href="/treatment/surgery/cleft-lip-palate">secondary cleft repair</a>    and they provide osteogenic potential in treating nonunion
    of <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">fractures</a> in
    conjunction with rigid fixation (and are less risky for unwanted
    effects than the use of systemic growth factors. Platelet
    reduced plasma (produced at time of operation by centrifuge)
    is an increasingly popular alternative. Rigid bone grafts
    are often used to provide continuity and support in jaw defects
    and to replace <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed">orbital volume in trauma</a>.</p>
<p>Common donor sites for nonvascularised bone graft harvesting
    are the iliac crest (top part of pelvic bone / hip; provides
    cancellous and cortical bone), tibia (shinbone; cancellous),
    ribs, calvaria (skull) and mandible.</p>
<p>There are various commercially available synthetic bone substitutes
    (for example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">demineralised bone matrix</a>,
    calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">calcium hydroxyl apatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2</a>,
    a synthetic version of the natural bone mineral; Figure 9)
    which can add bulk and some scaffolding to the native bone
    but are seldom useful entirely on their own. There is one
    exception to this: synthetic grafts heal well in calvarial
    (skull) graft sites. Cadaveric bone has not found favour
    in mainstream maxillofacial reconstructive surgery. A short,
    low-morbidity, operation to acquire somebody’s own bone from
    a suitable and regenerable source is usually best.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Synthetic calcium hydroxyl apatite
        powder.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bone grafting is generally successful. The requirements for successful
    bone grafting include a healthy bed (to enable vascularization),
    relative immobility (for bony union) and freedom from infection.
    An autogenous bone graft is initially devoid of blood supply
    and it revascularizes by ingrowth of capillaries from the
    adjacent bed. The existing bone ‘scaffold’ is eventually
    replaced by its <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">resorption and the deposition of new bone</a>.
    Cortical bone tends to take longer (but can provide useful
    mechanical support during this time) than cancellous bone.
    Cancellous bone can be incorporated into the host skeleton
    within three months.</p>
<p>Other than donor site morbidity (for example, with iliac crest
    harvest, scarring, numbness on side of leg and groin, aching
    and deformity), the main adverse event is bone graft loss.
    The presence of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    is a contraindication to free bone grafting because the success
    rate is dramatically reduced. Tissue beds after previous
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> or with
    adjuvant radiotherapy planned / ongoing are commonly associated
    with bone graft loss. In these instances, vascularised bone
    transfers (see below) have a substantially higher success
    rate.</p>
<h2>Cartilage crafts</h2>
<p>Cartilage grafts are useful in specific areas of reconstruction,
    particularly for the nose. The best source are autogenous
    grafts. Three donor sites are commonly used: the nasal septum,
    the ear and the ribs. Cartilage has a low rate of rejection
    and can provide good support for overlying soft tissue. It
    has little or no antigenicity (does not trigger a strong
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammatory response by the adaptive immune system</a>)
    and can be harvested as a composite graft incorporating thick
    skin or mucosa.</p>
<h2>Nerve grafts</h2>
<p>Nerve reconstructions are usually carried out as free cable grafts,
    although nerve transfers can be incorporated as part of a
    vascularized free tissue transfer (see below). The cable
    nerve graft gains its blood supply from the tissue bed and
    provides the scaffold for reinnervation. Common applications
    for nerve grafts in the head and neck region are <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">facial nerve</a>    reconstruction following <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">radical parotid gland surgery</a>    and reinnervation of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">mental nerve</a>    following <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion/more-info">mandibular resection</a>    with loss of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">inferior alveolar nerve</a>.
    Nerve grafting requires microsurgical re-anastomosis under
    magnification.</p>
<p>Common donor sites for head and neck reconstruction include the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">great auricular nerve</a>    (runs in front of the ear) and the sural nerve (sensory neve
    in the lower leg and foot). The superficial branches of the
    radial nerve (upper arm) have been used as part of vascularized
    tissue transfer techniques (see below). Although often deemed
    technically successful, the reinnervation generally comprises
    some 30 % of a complete recovery. It is worthwhile in facial
    nerve reconstruction because there will often be better facial
    tone, even if complete reanimation is not achieved. Success
    using cadaveric reconstituted nerve grafting has been reported,
    and this may obviate the donor site arguments against nerve
    grafting.</p>
<h1 id="flaps">Flaps</h1>
<p>A flap is tissue that is transferred with its own blood supply
    from the donor site to the recipient site. Therefore, a flap
    is much less dependent on the recipient site for take. The
    use of flaps with their own blood supply allows more tissue
    bulk and predictable healing and viability (Figure 10).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> A local buccal mucosal advancement
        flap has preserved function after excision of a small
        buccal mucosal malignancy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two main patterns of blood supply for flaps; random
    and axial. A random pattern flap relies on a general subcutaneous
    blood flow. As there is no specific vascular supply (no named
    blood vessel), there is a limit to the amount of tissue transferable
    before distal flap <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>    occurs. In random pattern flaps this is usually a ratio of
    1 : 2 for base to length of the flap. In the head and neck,
    due to its rich vascular network, a ratio of 1 : 3, and sometimes
    more, is safe.</p>
<p>An axial flap is based on a specific vascular pedicle running
    in the subcutaneous plane. It supplies an area of overlying
    skin (the vascular territory is termed the angiosome). The
    vascular supply of an axial pattern flap is more reliable
    than that of a random pattern one. Provided the vascular
    pedicle is safely included, much larger and longer flaps
    can be raised.</p>
<p>Myocutaneous flaps (involving muscle and skin) such as the pectoralis
    major or latissimus dorsi flaps (see below) are usually a
    combination of the two patterns of blood supply: an axial
    muscular supply with a random patterned supply to the overlying
    skin by small ‘perforating’ vessels. The skin paddle is dependent
    on small musculocutaneous vessels arising from the vascular
    pedicle(s) deep to the muscle. The axial blood supply means
    that muscle-only flaps can also be raised. Myocutaneous flaps
    tend to be bulky although the denervated muscle atrophies
    (shrinks) with time.</p>
<h2>Classification of flaps</h2>
<p>There are two main categories of flaps: pedicled flaps and free
    flaps.</p>
<p>Pedicled flaps can be</p>
<ul>
    <li>local flaps (for example, tongue flap, buccal fat pad, nasolabial
        or submental flaps; see below)</li>
    <li>distant flaps (for example, deltopectoral (axial pattern)
        or pectoralis major (myocutaneous) flaps; see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Free (microvascular tissue transfer) flaps are distant flaps,
    with common donor sites including</p>
<ul>
    <li>radial forearm</li>
    <li>fibula</li>
    <li>deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA)</li>
    <li>anterolateral thigh</li>
    <li>rectus abdominis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pedicled flaps</h2>
<p><strong>Local flaps</strong> are a popular reconstructive method
    for small defects, particularly when the wound bed is not
    suitable for grafting (for example, for a through-and-through
    defect, or if only a cortical bone surface is available)
    or the wound is too big for primary closure. Local flaps
    use adjacent tissue which has the ideal characteristics required
    for the defect. The blood supply depends on random patterned
    subdermal plexus of vessels. The rich vascular supply of
    the face and oral cavity is well suited to this technique.</p>
<p>Factors to take into consideration when raising such local flaps
    include likely cosmetic results and ensuring the blood supply
    entering the flap at its base is not compromised by tension
    or kinking. Examples of local flaps in the oral cavity include
    buccal mucosa advancement flaps and the buccal fat pad flap
    (Figure 11 and Figure 12).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> The buccal fat pad flap is a
        useful local piece of well-vascularised tissue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> The buccal fat pad flap mucosalizes
        by epithelial cell seeding but tends to scar and fibrose.</figcaption>
</figure>
<aside>
    <p>Local flaps in the reconstruction of facial skin defects
        are described and discussed in our section about the
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">treatment of facial skin cancers</a>        .</p>
</aside>
<p>The <strong>nasolabial flap</strong> is a common example of a
    local pedicled flap used in the reconstruction of oral cavity
    defects. It is a random pattern flap and relies on the rich
    vascular network of the face. It is a safe reliable two-staged
    technique (inset to allow vascularization from the adjacent
    tissue bed before division of the pedicle two to three weeks
    later).</p>
<p>A finger of skin is raised (inferiorly based for oral defect)
    and tunnelled through the cheek and buccal mucosa to repair
    the adjacent floor of mouth, tongue or alveolar defects.
    Occasionally, the tip of the flap may necrose. Bilateral
    flaps are often used for small to moderate sized anterior
    floor of mouth defects. The donor sites are closed primarily
    and heal well with minimal cosmetic defect within the nasolabial
    folds (Figure 13).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Top left: outline of a nasolabial
        flap; top right: the nasolabial flap is raised in the
        fat plane above the muscles of facial expression; bottom
        left: the flap is passed through the cheek and the majority
        of the donor site is closed primarily (division of the
        flap base, inset and final closure take place at three
        weeks following initial operation); bottom right: final
        result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A <strong>distant / regional pedicled flap</strong> is usually
    defined as any flap raised outside the local area (below
    the mandible) and transferred to reconstruct head and neck
    defects. Examples of large pedicled distant flaps used in
    head and neck reconstruction are the deltopectoral and the
    pectoralis major flaps (see below).</p>
<p>The <strong>deltopectoral flap</strong> is an axial patterned
    skin flap, based on the first four perforating branches of
    the internal mammary artery (Figure 14). The flap is medially
    based and transversely orientated on the upper chest. It
    is a two-staged technique, initially rotated to repair large
    wounds in the neck and lower part of the face. The donor
    site and the pedicle are temporarily dressed. At the second
    stage, two to three weeks later, the pedicle is divided and
    the proximal component reinset to the chest. The distal defect
    of the donor site is skin grafted (see above). This flap
    has been superseded by other flaps but remains a good fall-back
    option.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure14.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 14:</strong> A deltopectoral flap before division
        and inset.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <strong>pectoralis major flap</strong> was the ‘workhorse’
    for the reconstruction of oral cavity defects in the 1980s.
    It remains an important reconstructive option (for example,
    if a patient is not fit or suitable for free flap surgery,
    or if no microvascular facilities or expertise are available,
    or if an initial free flap has failed).</p>
<p>The vascular pedicle is based on the pectoral branch of the thoraco-acromial
    artery. It can be raised as a skin paddle (myocutaneous)
    or as muscle-only flap. The pectoralis major muscle is associated
    with a large skin territory (allowing a good sized skin paddle
    and usually primary closure of the donor site), good muscle
    bulk (useful to protect neck vessels when tunnelled into
    position), and a good arc of rotation enabling variable positioning
    for reconstruction of any head and neck defects up to the
    zygomatic arch. It is relatively easy to raise without the
    need to reposition the patient during surgery and it is generally
    very reliable. However, it is bulky and can be too rigid
    for certain oral defects requiring a more pliable reconstruction.
    Figure 15 shows an example of a pectoralis major myocutaneous
    flap, Figure 16 shows an example of a muscle-only pectoralis
    major flap.</p>

<h2>Free flaps</h2>
<p>Microvascular or free tissue transfer has been <i>the</i> major
    advancement in reconstructive surgery since the 1980s. The
    technique involves the harvesting and detachment of tissue
    with its blood (and sometimes nerve) supply and transferring
    it to repair a distant complex defect. The blood (and nerve)
    supply of the transplanted tissue is then re-established
    by re-anastomosis of its vascular pedicle to suitable vessels
    (and nerve) at the recipient site using microvascular techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Microvascular surgical techniques</strong>, the ability
    to anastomose blood vessels using operative magnification,
    has revolutionized reconstructive surgery. The surgery is
    complex and demands certain specific processes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Preoperative assessment – this includes clinical examination
        and usually imaging (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>        and/or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> scans),
        for example of the donor site vascular situation. The
        aim is to ensure that there is no abnormal pathology
        or aberrant vascular anatomy that will threaten the success
        of flap transfer or the safety of the donor site such
        as viability of the foot following harvest of a fibula
        flap (see below).</li>
    <li>Perioperative issues – a two-team approach is commonly adopted,
        one team carrying out the ablation and the other team
        raising the flap simultaneously. The diameter of vessels
        involved commonly ranges from 1 to 3 mm. The vessels
        are joined end to end or end to side using 9/0 to 11/0
        sutures and microsurgical instruments under an operating
        microscope or loupes.</li>
    <li>Postoperative monitoring – the flap’s viability is most at
        risk within the first 48 hours of surgery. Although various
        monitoring tools are available (including implantable
        Doppler (a 20 MHz pulsed ultrasound probe, directly connected
        with sutures to the monitored vessel on a cuff and allowing
        for real-time blood-flow measurement), microdialysis
        (monitoring flap metabolism by continuous measurements
        of glucose, lactate or pyruvate levels in the interstitial
        tissue fluids) and laser flow Doppler (optical monitoring
        of red blood cell flow based on Doppler effect (frequency
        change), using laser light) probes), regular clinical
        monitoring by visual inspection remains a mainstay. Venous
        occlusion will result in a blue engorged flap (Figure
        17). Arterial blockage is more difficult to detect and
        results in a white flaccid flap. Flap salvage relies
        on prompt detection, re-exploration, identification and
        correction of kinking, haematoma or vascular occlusion.</li>

<p>There are several advantages to the use of free flaps. Complex
    defects are better reconstructed with a completely new blood
    supply (healthy fresh tissue will promote healing). Distant
    tissue can now be used (no longer limited by attached pedicle)
    and the type as well as amount of tissue harvested can be
    better tailored to the defect. This complex technique is
    now considered so reliable that it is often the first choice
    for reconstruction. Table 1 compares pedicled flaps to free

<p>There is a fair number of common <strong>free flaps used for oral defects</strong>.
    The radial forearm free flap is generally considered to be
    the workhorse for head and neck reconstruction, in particular
    oral soft tissue defects. It can be used for bony defects
    as a composite flap although other, better options exist
    such as the fibula, deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) and
    scapula flaps. The latter is particularly suited for complex
    defects as multiple tissue types at different orientations
    are possible based on the same vascular pedicle. The major
    disadvantage is the need to turn the patient mid operation.
    For this reason some teams use a combination of flaps that
    can be harvested with the patient supine.</p>
<p>Common flaps with their blood supply include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Radial forearm - radial artery.</li>
    <li>Pectoralis major - thoraco-acromial artery, lateral thoracic,
        internal mammary.</li>
    <li>Scapula - circumflex scapular branch of the subscapular artery.</li>
    <li>Latissimus dorsi - thoraco-dorsal artery.</li>
    <li>Anterolateral thigh - lateral circumflex femoral artery.</li>
    <li>Fibula - peroneal artery.</li>
    <li>DCIA - deep circumflex iliac artery.</li>
    <li>Trapezius - superiorly based: occipital artery, paraspinal
        perforators; lateral island: transverse cervical artery;
        inferiorly base: transverse cervical and dorsal scapular
        arteries.</li>
    <li>Deltopectoral - perforator arteries from the internal mammary;
        blood supply to the extension of this flap beyond the
        thoraco-acromial artery and deltopectoral groove is non-axial.</li>
    <li>Rectus - dual supply: superior and inferior epigastric (most
        flaps are raised on inferior epigastric vessels).</li>
    <li>Paramedian - axial flap based on the supratrochlear artery.</li>
    <li>Nasolabial - technically random pattern flap; the small vessels
        of the subdermal plexus are generally orientated along
        its long axis.</li>
    <li>Submental neck skin and platysma muscle based on the terminal
        branches of the facial and submental artery - useful
        when a neck dissection is not needed (that is for non-malignant
        disease).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>radial forearm free flap</strong> is a well established
    flap. Its skin paddle is based on the radial artery, its
    venae comitantes and optional cephalic vein (Figure 18).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure18.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 18:</strong> A radial forearm free flap harvested
        with the radial artery, vena comitans, cephalic vein
        and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve of the forearm.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The radial forearm flap provides soft, thin and pliable skin
    and fascia with, if required, bone, nerve or tendon. The
    quality of the skin is well suited for reconstructing intraoral
    defects where the aim is to provide coverage and at the same
    time allow residual oral tissue such as tongue and floor
    of mouth the flexibility to continue to function (Figure
    19).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure19.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 19:</strong> A radial forearm free flap in
        situ showing tongue mobility by providing a stretchable
        layer of tissue in the ventral tongue and floor of the
        mouth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The radial forearm flap has a reliable long pedicle, good vessel
    caliber and allows simultaneous harvesting during head and
    neck ablation, reducing operating time. The donor site can
    be repaired with a local flap or, more commonly, with a full-
    or split-thickness skin graft (Figure 20).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure20.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 20:</strong> The radial forearm donor site
        defect after closure using the ipsilateral full-thickness
        forearm skin graft technique.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The radial bone component is limited with regard to length and
    height (Figure 21) and is therefore less suitable for later
    rehabilitation with <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">dental implants</a>.
    The donor site radius has a significant risk of fracturing
    (Figure 22) although this can be overcome by prophylactic
    plating (Figure 23).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure21.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 21:</strong> The composite radial forearm
        free flap uses up to 40 % of the radius but still only
        provides a thin strut of bone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure22.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 22:</strong> As many as 25 % of composite
        forearm donor site defects fracture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure23.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 23:</strong> Prophylactic plating prevents
        this complication.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Interestingly the thin bone strut and the potential donor site
    defect have led to a real international polarization of views
    on the use of the composite radial forearm free flap. In
    the UK, techniques to overcome the donor site defect including
    prophylactic plating and full-thickness skin grafting (see
    above), possibly coupled with patients with very atrophic
    mandibles requiring composite resection, has meant the technique
    has been retained as part of a range of flaps for composite
    reconstruction. In Germany and parts of North America the
    technique is virtually never used and sometimes heavily criticized.
    Whether this is because the donor site management techniques
    have not been adopted or the atrophic mandible or maxilla
    with malignant disease is much less of an issue is unclear.</p>
<p>The <strong>fibula free flap</strong> provides a long (up to
    25 cm), vascularized, tubular (although really more triangular)
    shaped, thick cortical bone capable of reconstructing an
    angle-to-angle mandibular defect. The flap can be raised
    without skin or with a skin paddle.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure24.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 24:</strong> Top: the free fibula is a long
        bone and skin flap based on the peroneal vessels; bottom:
        it provides dense implantable bone (although not the
        bone height of the iliac crest flap), the pedicle length
        is a great advantage.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The bone is suitable for implants and, when harvested carefully,
    provides a reasonable skin paddle. The vascular pedicle can
    be lengthened significantly by trimming the proximal bone
    and is based on the peroneal artery and associated venae
    comitantes. The donor site can be primarily closed for very
    small skin paddles which leaves a reasonable donor site scar.
    The majority of skin flaps have to be split-thickness skin
    grafted, which delays donor site healing. Full-thickness
    skin grafting of this defect does not work anything like
    as well as it does on the forearm, and we have abandoned
    it.</p>
<p>It is important to assess the vascular supply of the donor leg.
    Magnetic resonance angiography, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRA</a>    is recognized internationally as the technique of choice.
    Duplex Doppler <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound assessment</a>    combined with a plain <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiograph</a>    has been shown to be reliable in detecting any abnormal anatomy
    or pathology that may threaten the success of the flap and/or
    viability of the foot. Simple assessment of pulses as the
    only preoperative assessment, while still advocated by some,
    has been abandoned by most. Joint stability is not a problem
    if the surgeon preserves at least 6 cm of fibula bone at
    the knee and the ankle. There will be numbness on the dorsum
    of the foot and there may be some weakness in dorsiflexing
    the big toe.</p>
<p>In some instances of <strong>complex defects</strong>, a single
    flap reconstruction is not adequate or optimal. The scapular
    flap with its numerous options is an excellent choice for
    such complex defects. However, this technique involves turning
    the patient peri-operatively and it increases shoulder morbidity.
    An alternative is to use combination flaps (Figure 25).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level2-figure25.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 25:</strong> Top left: complex multi-tissue
        defects may require multiple flaps; top right: in this
        case an osseocutaneous fibula flap; and bottom left:
        a chimeric anterolateral thigh flap; bottom right: postoperative
        appearance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Certain flaps (<strong>innervated flaps</strong>) can be harvested
    with either their nerve supply (sensory, motor) or a vascularized
    nerve incorporated.</p>
<p>A sensate flap (for example, a radial forearm flap) can be useful
    if there is a recipient nerve in the head and neck such as
    a divided <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">lingual nerve</a>    . Reinnervation of a sensate flap can be an advantage when
    reconstructing the soft palate, pharynx and lip to aid functional
    rehabilitation, especially with <a href="/help/salt">swallowing and speech</a>    . Facial reanimation is a common reason for motor reinnervation.
    It can also be useful to maintain muscle bulk or tone in
    total glossectomy.</p>
<p>As a working principle, it is now felt that limited sensory recovery
    usually occurs in thin flaps without direct nerve anastomosis
    and that recovery in thick flaps, even with neural anastomosis,
    is very limited. There is no good justification for damaging
    a recipient-site nerve in order to attempt sensate recovery
    of a flap. However, if such a nerve is resected in tumour
    ablation or trauma surgery, then re-anastomosis of an unavoidably
    sensate flap is rational. Motor nerve harvest and anastomosis
    follow a similar principle when reconstruction of solid tissue
    is the primary aim of the procedure. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">Facial nerve</a>    reconstruction in isolation is quite a different consideration.</p>
<p>In a bid to further improve the character of some free flaps,
    the donor site tissue planned for transfer can be modified
    to provide <strong>prefabricated flaps.</strong> For example,
    a cartilage structure harvested from the costal margin and
    carved to resemble a pinna (outer part of the ear) can be
    set into the soft tissue of a forearm distally. Once established,
    this modified tissue (prefabricated structure) can be transferred
    as a free flap to replace a missing ear. Similar procedures
    have been described for mucosa and bone. Inevitably these
    flaps are part of a delayed reconstructive process.</p>
<p>There remains debate about what exactly is meant by the term
    <strong>perforator flap</strong>. Some claim almost all flaps
    are ‘perforator flaps’, others list a few named flaps where
    visualization of the perforating vessels from the named flap
    vessel to the supplied tissue (usually skin) is the defining
    parameter. Probably the most accurate and useful definition
    would be to define these flaps as those where a defined area
    of tissue is supplied by an unnamed vessel which perforates
    fascia to supply skin and is identified, dissected from surrounding
    tissue and anastomosed when reconstructing an area with that
    flap. The advantage of this type of flap - no significant
    blood supply is impeded and only the required reconstructive
    tissue is harvested - would be clearly demonstrated while
    easily demonstrating its disadvantage: the pedicle is actually
    very short and the diameter is small.</p>
<p>Although the anterolateral thigh free flap is the most widely
    described ‘perforator flap’, most surgeons actually dissect
    the length of the descending branch of the lateral circumflex
    femoral vessels (thereby removing a named but relatively
    unimportant vascular tree). This gives a long pedicle and
    large diameter vessels, the actual perforating component
    (going through fascia to supply skin) is a relatively short
    length of vessels requiring intramuscular dissection in 80
    % of patients. The skin paddle of the fibula often has visible
    perforating vessels to the skin, but these are seldom dissected
    through muscle and fascia to isolate them. The lateral sural
    artery perforator flap is variably dissected as a soleal
    branch of the peroneal vessels and the medial sural artery
    perforator flap always involves intramuscular dissection
    – all short expendable vessels but they are anatomically
    named. The relative significance of retaining the tissue
    (usually muscle) at the donor site is very debatable, with
    the possible exception of the transverse deep inferior epigastric
    perforator flap used for breast reconstruction in younger
    women or for <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/more-info">soft tissue trauma</a>    coverage, where there is an arguable advantage in retaining
    a semi-functioning rectus abdominus muscle.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>Free flap success rates are usually reported to be in excess
    of 95 %. Inevitably, there are local variations with types
    of flap and expertise available. The presence of co-existing
    medical conditions (usually cardiorespiratory diseases,
    <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">expected in smokers</a>) can have an important bearing on
        the likelihood of complications, which in turn can affect
        viability of free flaps during the immediate postoperative
        stage.</p>
<p>A free flap technique offers many advantages but is an all or
    none phenomenon. Total flap loss will result in a persisting
    defect and a weakened patient. A second reconstructive procedure
    can put that patient at a significant risk. Donor site morbidity
    should always be considered during the treatment planning
    as this is of considerable importance to overall quality
    of life.</p>
<p>Factors affecting free flap success include:</p>
<p>local factors such as</p>
<ul>
    <li>surgical mishaps (such as microsurgical suturing, pedicle
        tension or compression)</li>
    <li>wound complications (such as haematoma, bleeding or wound
        infection;</li>
</ul>
<p>general factors such as</p>
<ul>
    <li>systemic hypotension with inadequate arterial flow;</li>
    <li>increased coagulability (excessive transfusion, donor site
        bleeding);</li>
    <li>vascular spasm (cold environment, smoking).</li>
</ul>
