<p>By far the most common form of oral cancer is squamous cell carcinoma
    (SCC). SCC is a malignancy of the cells lining the lips,
    mouth and throat. These are cells similar to those of skin
    but don’t under normal circumstances have the thicker layer
    of keratin that skin has.</p>
<h1 id="causes">Causes</h1>
<p>Most oral cancer (as in most of upper aerodigestive tract cancer)
    is due to tobacco and alcohol consumption to “excess” (over
    75%). Our knowledge of risk factors associated with oral
    cancer is principally that of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">squamous cell carcinoma</a>.
    There is relatively little known about the aetiology of salivary
    cancer, sarcoma or mucosal melanoma.</p>
<h2><a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">Tobacco</a></h2>
<p>There is overwhelming evidence that tobacco usage in the form
    of cigarette, cigar and pipe smoking is associated with a
    more than 10-fold increase of the risk of developing oral
    cancer in comparison to non-users. All forms of tobacco smoking
    are associated with increased risk. There is also evidence
    that heavier and prolonged usage of tobacco is associated
    with a greater risk of having oral cancer as well as a second
    malignancy. Smoking cessation is worthwhile as the risk after
    abstention for more than 10 years becomes similar to that
    of non-smokers.</p>
<p>The <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">mechanism of tobacco carcinogenesis</a>    has been well researched. There are several hundred carcinogens
    identified in tobacco smoke, e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons and
    tobacco specific nitrogen compounds. These agents act both
    locally and systemically. They interfere with DNA replication
    leading to mutations, and contribute to the molecular chain
    of events in malignant transformation.</p>
<p>Chewing tobacco with or without areca (betel) nut and snuff dipping
    (placing it buccally) are both associated with oral cancer
    The areca nut is itself an oral carcinogen. It is associated
    with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">submucous fibrosis</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">epithelial dysplasia</a>,
    leading on to malignant transformation particularly if used
    in conjunction with tobacco. The areca nut is chewed as a
    quid of betel leaves and slaked lime, with or without tobacco.
    It is popular in the Indian sub-continent, South East Asia
    and New Guinea.</p>
<h2><a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">Alcohol consumption</a></h2>
<p>As there is a tendency for those who smoke to also consume alcohol,
    often in significant quantities, care is needed in interpreting
    their association with oral cancer. There is good evidence
    that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with a significant
    risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer. For example, consuming
    100g of alcohol or more per day increases the risk of developing
    oral cancer by at least six-fold. Although certain alcoholic
    beverages may have significant contributory impurities, it
    is thought that the quantity of alcohol consumed is the main
    significant risk factor.</p>
<p>Alcohol is thought to contribute to cancer of the head and neck
    by local and systemic mechanisms. These include ethanol-induced
    increased permeability of oral mucosa (to carcinogens), active
    metabolites of ethanol being carcinogenic, heavy drinkers
    with liver disease resulting in reduced detoxification of
    carcinogens and poor diet associated with alcoholics.</p>
<h2>Synergistic effect of smoking and alcohol</h2>
<p>Smoking and high alcohol consumption is associated with a synergistic
    or multiplicative effect in terms of risk of oral cancer.
    Heavy drinkers who also smoke a lot have an over 35 times
    greater risk in comparison to those who do not smoke or drink.</p>
<p>As some 75% of those with oral cancer smoke and/or drink alcohol,
    these factors should be targeted in preventing oral cancer.</p>
<h2>Other factors</h2>
<p>Consumption of fruit and vegetables has a protective beneficial
    effect. Certain diets such as salted fish (Chinese) had been
    reported to have an increased risk of pharyngeal cancer.</p>
<p>Certain viruses are known to be closely related to human cancer.
    For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with Kaposi’s
    sarcoma, Epstein Barr virus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
    Hepatitis B virus in hepatocellular carcinoma and Human Papilloma
    Virus (HPV) in cervical and anogenital cancer. The <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">HPV/oral cancer</a>    link is currently being investigated. The HPV 16 and 18 strains
    are particularly implicated, and are associated with base
    of tongue/tonsillar cancers, which has seen a marked increase
    in recent years (up to 15% per annum). People affected tend
    to be younger, are less likely to be smokers, and (if non-smokers)
    have much better outcomes in terms of survival. This has
    led to a number of studies involving treatment intensity
    reduction in those treated by radiotherapy in a bid to reduce
    the very severe morbidity associated with many of the more
    recent non-surgical oncological treatments (such as <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    and particularly <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemoradiotherapy</a>).</p>
<p>Irradiated tissue has a long-term risk of forming new malignancies.
    This is one of the many reasons to look at non-radiation
    options in treating cancers in younger patients.</p>
<p>Poor dental status had often been quoted as a cause of oral cancer.
    However, these patients often have confounding factors such
    as poor socio-economic status, heavy alcohol and tobacco
    usage as well as poor dietary habits.</p>
<h2><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">Premalignant conditions/lesions</a></h2>
<p>An oral leukoplakia (WHO definition) is a white patch or plaque
    that cannot be characterized, clinically or histopathologically,
    as any other disease. Erythroplakia can be similarly described
    but for bright red patches or plaques. Erythroleukoplakia
    (speckled leukoplakia) forms the third lesion commonly associated
    with risk of malignant transformation. This risk has been
    reported to be 2-6% for leukoplakia (varies with sites, e.g.
    highest in floor of mouth). 40-50% of erythroplakias have
    high grade dysplasia or carcinoma present. Speckled leukoplakia
    is of intermediate risk.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/diagnoses/mouth-cancer/level3/figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> An example of leukoplakia, anterior
        floor of the mouth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other lesions associated with malignant transformation include
    chronic hyperplastic candidiasis, submucous fibrosis and
    sideropenic dysphagia. Less commonly, certain conditions
    such as dyskeratosis congenita (tongue leukoplakia); discoid
    lupus erythematosus (lip cancer) and lichen planus (1-3%
    incidence, lichenoid dysplasia main reason) have a risk of
    malignant change.</p>
<p>The management of these premalignant lesions, in particular,
    leukoplakia, can be controversial. Cessation of smoking is
    beneficial, with spontaneous resolution seen in some 50%
    of lesions in some studies. Some clinicians prefer to closely
    observe these lesions with selective biopsies where there
    are worrying changes such as induration, contact bleeding,
    ulceration or conversion to erythroplakia. Surgeons, in particular,
    may advocate laser excision with the aim of achieving thorough
    histological analysis and reducing the incidence of malignant
    transformation.</p>
<p>Decision making depends on several issues such as whether the
    lesions are localized (easy to remove) or widespread, patient
    compliance and preference as well as clinician’s resources.
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">Biopsies</a> are often
    carried out to assess the degree of dysplasia, in particular
    where there is speckled leukoplakia or erythroplakia. A large
    proportion of these lesions have high grade dysplasia if
    not malignant transformation.</p>
<p>Vitamin A and related compounds (retinoids) have been used as
    chemo-preventive agents. Some studies have demonstrated the
    resolution of leukoplakia with regular usage of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">retinoids</a>.
    However, the side-effects associated with retinoids usage
    can be considerable. Poor compliance and recurrence of lesions
    on cessation of these chemo-preventive agents have limited
    the usefulness of this treatment modality.</p>
<p>The use of NSAIDs in chemoprevention of oral cancer is unsupported
    by evidence and is a good example of research fraud.</p>
<h1 id="diagnosis-journey">Diagnosis journey</h1>
<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>Oral cancer can be asymptomatic for some time, resulting in late
    presentation. In addition, a significant proportion of oral
    cancer sufferers are alcohol dependent recluses.</p>
<p>Early symptoms and signs of oral cancer include persistent mouth
    ulceration (often painless), lumps, white, red or speckled
    lesions. Later, features such as recent onset of difficulty
    with speech or swallowing, numbness, neck swelling (lymphadenopathy)
    and unexplained loosening of tooth/teeth. Any of these persistent
    lesions (more than 3 weeks) should be referred urgently for
    specialist opinion and possible biopsy. Although the vast
    majority of oral cancer is clinically apparent, both patients
    and general practitioners may miss a small proportion. Some
    can present late with enlarging neck nodes.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/diagnoses/mouth-cancer/level3/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Left, level 1 pathologically enlarged
        lymph node.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fine needle aspiration cytology examination (using a needle and
    syringe to aspirate cells from a lump in an outpatient clinic
    setting) can be useful diagnostically.</p>
<p>The oral mucosa has a renowned ability to heal. It is therefore
    important for the specialist to see the suspected lesion
    intact, i.e. leave the biopsy procedure to them. This will
    enable better recording and more accurate treatment planning.</p>
<p>Techniques to reveal high risk lesions are available, e.g. Toluidine
    blue rinse, optical techniques. It is generally accepted
    that this method is not suitable for general use due to a
    significant proportion of false positive and negative results.</p>
<p>There is a drive from both the professionals and the government
    to improve outcome in head and neck cancer. In the state
    controlled systems of the UK this has produced a top down
    dogmatic administrative approach which has mixed benefits.
    These efforts included setting standards in quality and quantitative
    parameters in the form of guidelines, recommendations, political
    cancer strategies by various governments and expert group
    consensus views (in the UK NICE produced a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">document</a>    on head and neck cancer).</p>
<h2>Data collection, referral pattern, fast track system, delays</h2>
<p>Data collection for cancer statistics is vital for improving
    outcome. In the UK the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">HANA project</a>    aims to standardize this aspect and enable auditing and research
    on a national basis. The UK government Cancer Strategy target
    for urgent referrals is aimed at reducing delays in urgent
    referral to appropriate cancer specialists. There is however
    the real risk of delays for cancer cases that had not been
    referred urgently. Part of these political initiatives in
    the UK, are driven by unfavourable comparisons in cancer
    survival (in general) between the UK and other developed
    European countries. There is a degree of frustration with
    nationwide broad brushstroke approaches to “national cancer
    statistics” as at least one pan-European survey showed Scotland
    to have one of the best 5-year survival rates for oral cancer
    when analysed specifically. “Lies, damned lies and statistics”
    is a cliché for a reason.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of mouth cancer is a major life event for the patient.
    It is important to ensure that a histological diagnosis is
    obtained as even experienced specialists can make a wrong
    diagnosis based on clinical grounds alone.</p>
<h2>Dealing with bad news</h2>
<p>This should be carried out in a sympathetic, unhurried manner
    within a quiet and private environment. Patients on receiving
    the news can become significantly stressed psychologically
    and not able to take in or retain much information. It is
    important that support is available such as a trained nurse
    counselor, a contact number to ring and written information
    with or without an information leaflet on oral cancer (that
    the patient can read). The general medical practitioner,
    family physician or other referral source should be informed
    promptly.</p>
<h2>Diagnostic work up</h2>
<p>In addition to history and clinical examination, <a href="/diagnosis/tests">further investigations</a>    are necessary to evaluate the extent of the disease and the
    fitness of the patient to undergo treatment both medically
    and psycho-socially.</p>
<h2>Assessment in practice</h2>
<p>The key questions to answer are tumour resectability (and proximity
    to vital structures), likelihood of neck (both sides) involvement
    and presence/absence of distant metastases.</p>
<h2>Primary Tumour</h2>
<p>Clinical assessment often yields a lot of information on its
    own within the oral cavity. However, occasionally, <a href="/diagnosis/tests">other methods</a>    are required to assess e.g. extension of tumour into pharynx,
    closeness to mandible, or retching or pain excluding a thorough
    examination. MRI is better than CT as the latter are often
    degraded by associated amalgam artifacts. More information
    on bone invasion can be gained using plain radiographs, MRI
    or CT scan and very rarely radio-isotope scintigraphic bone
    scans.</p>
<h2>Neck metastases</h2>
<p>Clinical palpation tends to miss some 30-40% of neck metastases.
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests">Imaging techniques</a> such as
    ultrasound, MRI or CT scanning and ultrasound-guided fine
    needle aspiration provides better accuracy (in ascending
    order). If a thorough histological analysis of neck specimens
    in clinically and radiologically negative necks is carried
    out some 30% of oral cancer patients will have occult disease
    in the neck.</p>
<h2>Distant metastases</h2>
<p>The vast majority of distant metastases arising from oral SCC
    occur in the thorax. CT of the thorax is more detailed and
    accurate than plain chest radiography and is usual in UK
    practice.</p>
<h1 id="staging-and-treatment-plan">Staging &amp; treatment plan</h1>
<h2>Staging of the disease</h2>
<p>It is important that the staging nomenclature adopted is widely
    accepted and therefore must be simple and clearly defined.
    The staging process allows the clinician to have a uniformly
    communicable description of that patient’s disease, i.e.
    the extent of the cancer. It helps in the treatment plan
    process, predicts prognosis and enables better audit (within
    and between different centres) as well as meaningful multi-centre
    studies.</p>
<p>Tables 1 and 2 show the current staging nomenclature in use for
    oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).</p>

<p>There are other staging methods. However, to be effective, a
    staging method needs to be widely known (and therefore adopted
    universally), easy to use, reliable to score and ideally
    able to fulfill its roles stated above. Despite its several
    inadequacies the TNM system remains the most universally
    used.</p>
<p>Once the staging process is completed, the definitive treatment
    plan can be formed. Treatment planning is generally carried
    out in a multi-disciplinary team setting. The team usually
    consists of head and neck cancer specialists; surgeon(s),
    clinical oncologist(s) with radiotherapy expertise, pathologist,
    radiologist as well as allied medical professions such as
    speech and language therapist, dietician, head and neck cancer
    nurse specialist. There are also other specialists associated
    with the service such as dental hygienist, maxillofacial
    technician and occupational therapist, psychologist and physiotherapist.
    The team approach is aimed at removing bias in treatment
    planning and outcome assessment and combining experience
    as well as expertise to ensure the best possible treatment
    can be provided for the patient.</p>
<h2>Treatment plan</h2>
<p>It is important to be clear as to the treatment intention for
    that individual patient. In the majority of cases, this is
    curative, in some cases it is entirely palliative which may
    be defined as “active” (usually using low dose low toxicity
    radiotherapy or chemotherapy) or best supportive care. Rarely
    “curative treatment with palliative intent” that is the same
    intensity of treatment; often surgery and radiotherapy is
    offered in the belief that even if the cancer is not curable
    on the grounds of metastases the best chance of effective
    symptom control lies with curative intensity treatment.</p>
<h2>Treatment intent</h2>
<p>The overall decision on accepting treatment must lie with the
    patient (when a competent adult). This will be made by balancing
    the information on acute and chronic morbidity of treatment,
    relative chances of cure, morbidity of not having optimum
    treatment and individual quality of life decisions. All patients
    are different and each will have differing priorities, they
    should be enabled to make the most appropriate decision for
    them, ideally with an adequate length of time, support and
    environment to come to a balanced decision.</p>
<p>Over 90% of mouth cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The natural
    progression of the disease involves invasion of local structures,
    spread to the regional cervical nodes and distant sites,
    principally the lungs. The invasive process is such that
    the microscopic front tends to be further than macroscopically
    apparent. The more advanced the disease, the poorer the prognosis.</p>
