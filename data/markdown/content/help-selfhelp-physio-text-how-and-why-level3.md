<p>Trauma to the head and neck region, as well as major oral and
    maxillofacial surgery can all have profound effects not only
    on the head and neck area but on other body parts too (for
    example, <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>    may have made use of your lower leg or your pelvis).</p>
<p>For some planned (elective) major surgery it may be a good idea,
    if time permits, to consider <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/fitness">physiotherapy as a pre-habilitation option</a>:
    the best possible degree of fitness and well-conditioned
    muscles in crucial body areas lead to faster mobilisation
    and recovery, and to better overall outcomes (a tried and
    tested approach in many places for orthopaedic surgery, such
    as replacement of hip or knee joints).  </p>
<aside>
    <p>It is helpful to have some idea of the anatomy of the head
        and neck (and other parts of the body) to develop a good
        understanding of the interplay of so many different components
        to make the body mechanics work. Read more in our section
        about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Our collection of <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos">exercises is demonstrated in short videos</a>    and it is subdivided into different body parts. While these
    bundles do give some guidance, a wider picture and inclusion
    of more exercises than one might think initially, are useful.
    The gentle exercises demonstrated in these <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos">video clips</a>    are all aimed at maintaining or improving movement, function
    and strength. Some are designed to support short-term recovery
    and mobilisation, some are suitable for long-term management
    and training, some are useful for prevention of undesirable
    effects.</p>
<p>Exercises should be done regularly, ideally 2 to 3 times a day.
    If you have any questions or problems, you should always
    consult a health professional.</p>
<h1 id="spine-the-cervical-spine-neck">Spine: the cervical spine (neck)</h1>
<p>The spine consists of 24 vertebrae (33 if one includes the 9
    fused bones of the sacrum and coccyx (bottom of the spine,
    tailbone)). The top seven vertebrae are classed as the cervical
    spine or neck. The neck is a well-engineered structure of
    bones, nerves, muscles, ligaments and tendons that is remarkably
    strong and flexible, allowing movement in three degrees of
    freedom (or three planes of movement). These movements are
    flexion and extension (moving your head forwards and backwards),
    rotation (looking over your shoulders) and side flexion (taking
    your ear to your shoulder).</p>
<p>The cervical spine performs several crucial roles, including:
    housing and protecting the spinal cord, supporting the head
    and its movements, and facilitating the flow of blood to
    the brain. The seven vertebrae of the neck begin at the base
    of the skull and extend down to the next section of the spine,
    the thoracic spine. At each level, the seven neck vertebrae
    protect their segment of the spinal cord and work with muscles,
    tendons, ligaments, and joints to provide a combination of
    support, structure, and flexibility to the neck. Different
    movements typically originate from different joints. For
    example, 50 % of flexion and extension movements occur from
    the uppermost vertebra next to the base of the skull, C1.
    Likewise, 50 % of rotational movements occur from the next
    vertebra down, C2. There is a large number of muscles involved
    in the head, face and neck, providing for a wide variety
    of movements. Some movements are facilitated primarily by
    one muscle, others require cooperative action of groups of
    muscles.</p>
<p>The set of exercises specifically for the <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/neck">neck</a>    cover the obvious tasks of improving strength and mobility
    of the neck but also aim, for example, to improve neck posture.
    Neck posture is an important component of <a href="/help/salt">enabling safe swallowing</a>.
    Depending on the individual situation, <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos">additional exercises</a>    targeting muscle groups in other body areas should be included
    in the daily exercise regime.</p>
<p>Neck exercises are particularly beneficial for</p>
<ul>
    <li>facial pain syndrome when neck stiffness is a feature</li>
    <li>all patients having neck surgery</li>
    <li>patients following local trauma where neck stiffness / pain
        is an issue</li>
    <li>patients undergoing radiotherapy in the head and neck region</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="spine-the-thoracic-spine-upper-and-mid-back">Spine: the thoracic spine (upper and mid back)</h1>
<p>The thoracic spine consists of twelve vertebrae. It connects
    from the bottom of the the cervical spine to the lumbar spine
    (low back). Whereas the cervical spine is built for flexibility
    (head movement), the thoracic spine is designed for stability
    as it has to support the torso. At each level its vertebrae
    (T1-T12) attach to the rib cage, therefore there is limited
    flexibility in the thoracic spine.</p>
<p>Because of this relative inflexibility, the thoracic spine can
    be more prone to pain. Along the entire spine there lie discs
    between the vertebrae (the intervertebral discs), these act
    as shock absorbers. These discs are thinner in the thoracic
    spine adding to its inflexibility. Despite these thinner
    discs in the thoracic spin region, problems with these discs
    are rare.</p>
<p>Following oral and/or maxillofacial surgical intervention or
    radiotherapy treatment to the neck, problems can occur in
    the shoulder region. Any shoulder, or shoulder region, dysfunction
    can lead to discomfort or dysfunction at the thoracic spine.</p>
<p>The set of exercises specifically for the <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/shoulder">shoulder region</a>    cover the obvious tasks of improving strength and reducing
    tension in the shoulder region (see below). Shoulder and
    back exercises typically are a good complement to neck exercises.
    In addition, for example, they may help to cope better with
    some temporary issues arising from, say having to use a crutch
    or walking stick for a while.</p>
<p>Back exercises are particularly beneficial for</p>
<ul>
    <li>all patients having neck surgery</li>
    <li>patients after trauma where ‘whiplash’ may be a problem</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="spine-the-lumbar-spine-low-back">Spine: the lumbar spine (low back)</h1>
<p>The lumbar spine consists of five vertebrae. It connects the
    bottom of the thoracic spine to the top of the sacrum (a
    large wedge shaped vertebra at the bottom of the spine, it
    forms the solid base of the spinal column). The individual
    vertebrae are known as L1-L5. These five vertebrae are the
    biggest unfused vertebrae in the spine. This enables them
    to support the weight of the entire torso.</p>
<p>The lumbar spine is designed for completing powerful tasks (such
    as lifting, twisting and bending) as well as being flexible,
    similar to the cervical spine. The lower down a vertebra
    is located in the lumbar spine, the more weight it must bear.
    The lowest two spinal segments, L4-L5 (including the intervertebral
    discs) bear the most weight and are therefore the most prone
    to degeneration and injury.</p>
<p>Exercises addressing low-back issues tend to include muscle groups
    in the whole body region, including <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/thigh">thigh</a>,
    <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/back-muscles">back</a>    and <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/pelvis">pelvis</a>.</p>
<p>Low back exercises are particularly beneficial for</p>
<ul>
    <li>general exercise for everbody</li>
    <li>after hip graft / flap reconstructive surgery (see below
        for donor sites)</li>
    <li>after graft / flap reconstructive surgery involving the abdominal
        muscles</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="glenohumeral-joint-shoulder">Glenohumeral joint (shoulder)</h1>
<p>The bones of the shoulder consist of the humerus (the upper arm
    bone), the scapula (the shoulder blade), and the clavicle
    (the collar bone). The shoulder joint is a ball and socket
    joint between the head of the humerus (ball) and the glenoid
    cavity (socket) of the scapula. The shoulder joint connects
    the upper limb to the body.</p>
<p>The nature of the ball and socket joint allows a wide range of
    movement. These are flexion and extension (moving your arm
    forwards and backwards), internal and external rotation (moving
    your hand behind your back and behind your head) and abduction
    and adduction (taking your arm out sideways and inwards across
    your body).</p>
<p>The shoulder joint is one of the most mobile joints in the body.
    This can, however, come at the expense of stability. There
    are many muscles and ligaments that assist with movement
    and stability of the shoulder. The larger muscles in and
    around the shoulder are powerful and assist to move the shoulder
    joint. The ligaments and smaller muscles (for example, the
    four small muscles known as the rotator cuff) assist with
    certain movements but mainly act as stabilisers. They ensure
    that the head of the humerus remains in the glenoid cavity
    throughout the movements that the upper limb provides.</p>
<p>Surgery in the head and neck region as well as surgical reconstruction
    can give rise to discomfort or dysfunction in the shoulder
    region for a variety of reasons, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The video clips of <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/shoulder">shoulder</a>    and <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/shoulder-blade">shoulder blade</a>    exercises largely cover all these circumstances; some exercises
    strengthen major muscle groups in the area, other exercises
    aim to improve the stability of the shoulder.</p>
<p>Shoulder exercises are beneficial for</p>
<ul>
    <li>everyone who has had significant neck surgery</li>
    <li>everybody undergoing head and neck radiotherapy</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoulder blade exercises generally aim to improve posture. As
    such, it is a good idea to include these exercises in any
    exercise regime to improve problems with the neck, shoulder
    or upper back.</p>
<h1 id="donor-sites-for-surgical-reconstruction">Donor sites for surgical reconstruction</h1>
<p>Many major oral and maxillofacial surgical interventions include
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    of surgical defects by hard and/or soft tissues, grafts and
    flaps, from other body parts. In fact, the discipline is
    not shy in using more or less all body areas as reservoirs
    for repairing defects in the head and neck region in order
    to restore and maintain as much function as possible, alongside
    with aiming for the best possible cosmetic results.</p>
<p>Some of the more common donor sites include the iliac crest (pelvis),
    fibula (lower leg), muscles such as the quadriceps (thigh),
    latissimus dorsi (back) or rectus abdominus (abdomen) or
    the forearm (for free flaps, as well as skin grafts).</p>
<p>Post-surgical areas used as donor sites do need to be rehabilitated
    to ensure a swift mobilisation and return to smooth movement
    and function.</p>
<h2>Iliac crest</h2>
<p>The iliac crests are the uppermost edges of the pelvis. The edges
    are easily felt by digging your fingers into the sides around
    your waistline.</p>
<p>There are a lot of muscles and ligaments in and around the pelvis.
    There are muscles that connect the lower limbs to the pelvis,
    and muscles that connect the torso and trunk to the lower
    body. It is important to ensure these are moved and worked
    to allow normal levels of mobility and function after surgery.</p>
<p>Any surgical site can be painful but the iliac crest has often
    been described as painful for a period of a few weeks after
    surgery. This is normal (given that access to the iliac crest
    requires cutting some major muscles) and will recover with
    time.</p>
<p>The iliac crest is a common donor site to repair surgical defects
    in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This is true for bone
    grafts as well as for free flaps and is simply the consequence
    of the pelvis providing a large amount of suitable bone material
    for the repair of many different types, shapes and volumes
    of defects. Recovery of this donor site benefits greatly
    from suitable <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/pelvis">exercises</a>.
    Not only does exercise support and accelerate mobilisation,
    it also prevents the developing of strange limping habits.
    The most suitable set of exercises for the pelvis region
    depends a little bit on the exact nature of the surgical
    cuts used (access to the iliac crest may be from different
    directions and may involve the cutting of different groups
    of muscles).</p>
<p>Hip / pelvis exercises are beneficial for</p>
<ul>
    <li>everyone who has had iliac crest graft or flap surgery (exercises
        to strengthen the low back, and/or thigh muscles and/or
        abdominal muscles are good additional options)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fibula</h2>
<p>The fibula is the long, thin bone of the lower leg. It runs alongside
    the tibia (shin bone) and plays a significant role in stabilising
    the ankle and supporting the muscles of the lower leg. The
    fibula does not carry weight and is not needed for that purpose,
    so can be used as a reservoir for replacing lost bone (plus
    some soft tissue alongside) in the head and neck region,
    for example to replace parts of the mandible.</p>
<p>The fibula is close to both joints of the lower leg, the knee
    and the ankle. Both joints need to be moved to ensure full
    and swift recovery of movement and function of the lower
    leg.</p>
<p>Due to the fibula’s role in providing stability for the ankle,
    it may feel a little ‘off your feet’ for a short period after
    surgery. Gentle <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/lower-leg">lower leg exercises</a>,
    as soon as possible after surgery, are extremely useful to
    return quickly to normal mobility.</p>
<p>Lower-leg exercises are beneficial for</p>
<ul>
    <li>everyone after fibula flap reconstructive surgery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Forearm</h2>
<p>The forearm contains two bones, the radius and the ulna. These
    bones extend parallel from the elbow, where they articulate
    with the humerus (upper arm bone) to the wrist, where they
    articulate with the carpals (wrist bones).</p>
<p>Many muscles and ligaments are located within the forearm and
    assist in movement of the elbow and wrist joints. As the
    wrist and hand have many, often delicate, movements and functions
    there are many small muscles and ligaments. Like other joints
    affected by surgery they need movement to regain and maintain
    their function.</p>
<p>The lower arm is a common site for taking free flaps as well
    as a variety of skin grafts; these need some time to heal.
    The area may feel tight and sore but this is normal, the
    healing process can be 6 to 8 weeks (minimum) <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/lower-arm">and lower-arm exercise</a>    is an important part of the healing process. It is important
    to look well after these <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/scar-massage">scars</a>    to ensure full recovery.</p>
<p>Forearm exercises are beneficial</p>
<ul>
    <li>after radial or ulnar flap surgery</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other donor sites</h2>
<p>Other commonly used donor sites include the muscles latissimus
    dorsi (muscle at the upper back/ lower shoulder), pectoralis
    major (chest muscle) and rectus abdominis (stomach muscle).
    These sites can provide functional bulk soft tissue, usually
    as flaps, for repairing large defects. Just like for any
    other donor site, these donor-site muscles and associated
    joints/limbs need exercising for returning to normal movement
    and function. Some of the actions of these muscles are simple
    basic everyday tasks, for example the rectus abdominis assists
    you sitting up in bed.</p>
<p>Exercises for <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/chest-muscles">chest donor sites</a>,
    <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/back-muscles">back donor sites</a>,
    <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/shoulder-blade">latissimius dorsi</a>    and <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/donor-sites/stomach-muscles">rectus abdominis</a>    specifically address these sites but usually are augmented
    by additional general exercises or exercises targetting the
    head and neck region, depending on individual circumstances.</p>
<h1 id="scar-massage">Scar massage</h1>
<p>Scar tissue may have a tendency to contract. Contracted scar
    tissue, in turn, can lead to reduced function, depending
    on the location of scars. Regular <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/scar-massage">scar massage</a>    is a good way to minimise such effects.</p>
<h1 id="lymphoedema-of-the-neck-region">Lymphoedema of the neck region</h1>
<p>Some surgical procedures, but in particular <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    applied to the head and neck region, can lead to lymphoedema
    of the neck. Some simple <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/lymphoedema">self-massage</a>,
    when used patiently and regularly, can help with decongestion
    and moving lymph fluid to areas where the fluid can be drained
    by the lymphatic system. This kind of self-massage may remain
    beneficial for the long term.</p>
<h1 id="trismus">Trismus</h1>
<p>Some surgical procedures, but in particular <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    applied to the head and neck region, can lead to difficulties
    with opening the mouth (trismus) and with moving the jaw.
    Some conditions affecting the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">jaw joint</a>    can also cause trismus. For acute trismus, such as after
    surgery or as a symptom of jaw joint problems, <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos">exercises</a>    that help to re-establish mouth opening and jaw movement,
    are obviously useful.</p>
<p>As far as long term, and often late onset, trismus as a consequence
    of radiotherapy is concerned, prevention is far better than
    any attempts at cure: <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/trismus">jaw exercises</a>    that maintain and support mobility of the jaws should be
    done regularly throughout the course of treatment and beyond,
    <i>before</i> any problems arise.</p>
<h1 id="temporomandibular-jaw-joint-problems">Temporomandibular (jaw) joint problems</h1>
<p>For <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">jaw joint problems</a>,
    in most instances intense physiotherapy and exercise are
    the first line treatment. Some gentle exercises are identical
    to those we demonstrate for <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/trismus">trismus</a>,
    some slightly more <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/jaw-joint">intense jaw exercise regimes</a>    with (progressing) gentle nudges for mouth opening and jaw
    mobility are particularly suitable for dealing with a range
    of common jaw-joint problems. Also <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/neck">exercises to strengthen and stabilise the neck</a>    and improve posture are usually helpful in reducing jaw joint
    problems.</p>
