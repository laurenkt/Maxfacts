<p>Necrosis means cell death. A number of different conditions can
    lead to this and the tissues involved are broadly divided
    into <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">hard tissue</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">soft tissue</a>    necrosis.</p>
<p>There are a variety of causes for this which can give an appearance
    of tissues literally rotting away. These causes, in the oral
    and maxillofacial setting are usually radiation / <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    (osteoradionecrosis) and chemical effects (medication related
    osteonecrosis of the jaws).</p>
