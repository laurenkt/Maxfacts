<p>Firstly, this is not about judging in any way. The point to this
    section is to inform you if your particular “poison” has
    caused your problem or will influence it in a detrimental
    way. If it has or does we will try to explain that and point
    you in the right direction to minimise further problems.</p>
<p>In fact, a large number and <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/overview">wide range of substances</a>    need to be considered here. Both <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">tobacco</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol</a> play a
    particularly prominent role, each on their own as well as
    in combination with each other. The large number of other
    relevant drugs may be subdivided into two categories:
    <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/prescription">prescription drugs</a> and <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/other">nonprescription drugs</a>.</p>
<p>We make no distinction between legal and illegal recreational
    drugs, or the illegal use of legal (prescription) drugs.
    If they cause you harm or make treatment more difficult then
    they are a problem – one you need to address. Closely related
    to the topic of the use of drugs are many aspects of <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/fitness">fitness</a>    which may affect your ability to deal with treatment(s),
    recovery and optimal final outcomes.</p>
<p>It may seem surprising but experience has shown that sometimes
    at a very difficult time in your life – for example a diagnosis
    of serious disease – your ability to make quite extreme positive
    lifestyle changes are enhanced. Take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
