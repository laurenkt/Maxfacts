<p>This section is dedicated to expectations and their realistic
    management. We think it is helpful and necessary to have
    realistic expectations both about how long it will take to
    recover, and what final outcomes are reasonable to expect.</p>
<p>We try to describe what is reasonable to expect if things go
    according to plan. This is not an exact science and we hope
    that most of what we produce in this section will be added
    to by the experiences of patients and carers as time goes
    on.</p>
<p>The meaning of ‘short’, ‘medium’ and ‘long’ term in absolute
    times varies greatly across the many different conditions
    we cover; the approximate times in days / weeks / months
    / years will thus be specified for each condition.</p>
<p>When reading the various entries in this section, please read
    the information wisely: the descriptions are based on statistical
    evidence and, in some instances, other empirical data. Statistics
    do not apply to individuals and are not directly applicable
    to predict exactly what will happen to you. However, knowing
    what tends to happen, averaged over a large cohort of cases,
    is useful to get a general impression and to set expectations
    at realistic levels. This in turn, avoids frustrations and
    disappointment later on.</p>
