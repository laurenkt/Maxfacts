<p>Ultrasound imaging is a well-established diagnostic modality
    in a maxillofacial surgery, with a range of applications.
    Below we give a brief overview of the basic working principles,
    the most common maxillofacial applications of ultrasound
    methodology, and a slightly more detailed explanation about
    the production of sound waves and how these acoustic waves
    can produce images.</p>
<h1 id="basic-working-principles">Basic working principles</h1>
<p>Ultrasound scans produce images <i>via</i> high frequency sound
    waves. The frequency range used in this technique (1 to 30
    MHz) for medical applications is called ultrasound (‘beyond
    sound’) because the region is outside the frequency range
    that we can hear (humans can hear in the range 16 Hz to 20
    kHz). Ultrasound scanning relies on a pulse-echo principle,
    which involves directing an ultrasound wave towards the material
    being investigated, and then listening for the returning
    ‘echo’ after the sound has been reflected off the object.</p>
<p>Ultrasound scans are probably best known for their applications
    in monitoring a foetus throughout pregnancy (‘baby TV’) but
    are generally widely used for the examination of soft and
    fluid-filled body parts (such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>).</p>
<p>Ultrasound scans only require relatively small and uncomplicated
    equipment, thus are economic and fairly portable, offering
    flexibility. This includes use in clinics, at the bedside,
    or in the operating theatre. Low-power ultrasound is generally
    used for diagnostic purposes (see below), whereas higher-power
    versions are used for interventional purposes. Using ultrasound
    for diagnostic purposes has advantages and disadvantages.
    For example, the frequency of the ultrasound wave defines
    the upper limit for the achievable spatial resolution in
    an ultrasound image, typically a few mm. This resolution
    is inferior to the resolution of other medical imaging modalities
    such as <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>    scans - but not all investigations benefit from the highest
    possible spatial resolution of an image.</p>
<p>Ultrasound scans exploit the different speed with which sound
    waves travel through different kinds of matter. The speed
    of sound in air (or more generally speaking, gases) is 330
    m/s, in water it is 1496 m/s, and in bone it is 3360 m/s.
    The speed of sound in soft and nearly liquid matter varies
    slightly, from 1450 m/s to 1600 m/s. This variation is enough
    to provide some degree of contrast for different soft body
    tissues such as fat or muscles.</p>
<p>Figure 1 summarises the various effects of matter on the ultrasound
    wave being emitted by the transducer probe.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-ultrasound-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Effects on the ultrasound wave
        as it travels through matter.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reflection of a part of the wave at an interface between two
    tissues with slightly different speed of sound produces an
    echo in the probe. This is the measured effect that produces
    the ultrasound image. If the interface is between two materials
    characterised by vastly different speeds of sound, the wave
    is completely reflected (for example, between air and skin,
    or bone and soft tissue) and a ‘shadow’ is created. This
    is the reason why ultrasound scans cannot ‘see’ beyond bones,
    and why some gel is applied to the skin before a scan (to
    avoid air between the skin and the probe).</p>
<p>The other effects in Figure 1 illustrate the losses and the damping
    the wave experiences while travelling through matter. Some
    of it is lost due to refraction (where the ultrasound wave
    changes direction when travelling through the interface (similar
    to optical waves)). Scattering occurs when the ultrasound
    wave hits small objects, roughly the size of its wavelength
    (of the order of 1 to 2 mm), for example small blood vessels.
    The speckled appearance of ultrasound-scan images is caused
    by this scattering effect. Finally, some of the ultrasound
    radiation is absorbed by tissue. The extent to which this
    happens depends strongly on the type of tissue and to some
    extent on the exact frequency of the ultrasound used and
    ultimately can lead to heating of the tissue. However, this
    is not an issue at the very low power of ultrasound radiation
    typically used for diagnostic purposes (see Figure 3, below).</p>
<h1 id="common-maxillofacial-applications">Common maxillofacial applications</h1>
<p>In a maxillofacial context, ultrasound scans are particularly
    relevant for investigations of the salivary glands, the thyroid
    gland, blood vessels and lymph nodes in the neck, other lumps
    in the neck, the tonsils, and the floor of the mouth. Ultrasound
    scans work particularly well for the examination of soft
    tissues close to the body’s surface. More specialised ultrasound
    scanning techniques can be used to observe blood flow (see
    below), there are methods to obtain three-dimensional images
    from ultrasound scans, and ultrasound scanning has been suggested
    as a diagnostic tool for the examination of some (parts of
    some) of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">cranial nerves</a>    (outside the bony confinement of the skull).</p>
<p>The rate of blood flow through arteries and veins can be measured
    by an ultrasound-scanning technique called Doppler scanning.
    This technique exploits a phenomenon called the Doppler effect.
    The Doppler effect is a change in wavelength / frequency
    of a wave, the source of which is moving relative to the
    observer (the effect is named after the physicist C. Doppler
    who first described the phenomenon in the 19<sup>th</sup>    century). The best known everyday-example is the change in
    pitch heard when a vehicle such as an ambulance is emitting
    an alarm and approaches, then moves away from an observer
    (see Figure 2). The pitch heard is higher during the approach
    and lower as the vehicle moves away.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-ultrasound-level3-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Top: a stationary source and receiver,
        with identical frequencies / wavelengths everywhere;
        bottom: movement of the source relative to the receiver
        alters the received frequency of the sound, even though
        the source frequency remains unchanged.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If an object investigated by ultrasound scanning is moving, this
    will cause the ultrasound echo to be Doppler-shifted to either
    higher or lower frequencies, depending on its relative motion
    toward or away from the probe. The magnitude of the shift
    depends on the velocity of the moving object. Doppler-ultrasound
    scanning measures the change in echo frequency to determine
    the velocity of the moving object. An important application
    of the phenomenon is the examination of blood flow in order
    to detect <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">blood clots</a>    or poor circulation. This is useful, for example, in the
    monitoring of the blood supply of free flaps after <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>    (where implantable Doppler probes are used).</p>
<p>In addition, ultrasound scans can provide real-time visual control
    and guidance for targeted <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">fine-needle biopsies</a>    to obtain material for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histological examination</a>.</p>
<p>Higher intensity / amplitude of the ultrasound waves can shift
    their use from diagnostic to therapeutic applications. Some
    therapeutic applications use short intense blasts of ultrasound
    directed at the region(s) of interest. In terms of dosage,
    diagnostic ultrasound applications use intensities of around
    0.1 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, whereas therapeutic ultrasound applications
    use 1000 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. An intermediate dosage of ultrasound
    can be used to provide deep heating to soft tissue within
    the body. This may be done to increase blood circulation,
    improve the extensibility of the tissue, or to reduce pain
    (see Figure 3). The low intensities typically used for diagnostic
    ultrasound applications do not cause tissue damage. However,
    local heating effects from medium- to high-power ultrasound
    applications can cause cell damage.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The relationship between dosage
        and various medical uses of ultrasound (not drawn to
        scale); diagnostic ultrasound imaging utilises a much
        lower intensity compared to therapeutic applications.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Therapeutic ultrasound applications include the breaking up of
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">calculi (stones) of the salivary glands</a>    and blood clots. The ultrasound range 25 to 50 kHz is used
    for a variety of industrial cleaning purposes, and is also
    used for the professional removal of dental plaque and particularly
    calculus. Some <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">endodontic procedures</a>    (root canal treatment) with the need to access hard-to-reach
    spaces benefit from the miniaturisation of the instrumentation:
    an ultrasonic tip is much smaller than a mechanical handpiece
    (Figure 4).</p>

<h1 id="technical-details-about-ultrasound-imaging">Technical details about ultrasound imaging</h1>
<p>Sound arises from some object undergoing an oscillation, which
    propagates as a wave of pressure through a substance. Take
    an audio speaker as an example. Audio speakers contain a
    diaphragm which vibrates and transfers energy to the surrounding
    air, which causes the molecules in air to oscillate. The
    sound is encoded in these vibrations and is transmitted through
    multiple and frequent collisions between the particles in
    air. Figure 5 illustrates schematically particles in air
    undergoing compression and rarefaction (reduction in density
    of the air).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-ultrasound-level3-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Sound propagating by particles
        in the air colliding with each other and transferring
        vibrations. This type of wave is called a longitudinal
        wave, meaning the vibrations and energy transfers are
        along the same direction as the overall direction of
        travel. The air pressure increases or decreases in comparison
        to atmospheric pressure at different points along the
        wave.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All modern ultrasound-scanning transducer probes rely on the
    piezoelectric effect in polar crystals to both produce the
    emitted ultrasound wave and to record the echo of the reflected
    portion of the wave. Figure 6 shows a sketch of the working
    principle of an ultrasound probe. Ultrasound scans of the
    head and neck region normally use small transducers and frequencies
    in the range 7.5 to 10 MHz for optimal resolution.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-ultrasound-level3-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Deformation of a piezoelectric
        crystal causes the emitted ultrasound wave; the recording
        of the echo is the reverse process.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The receiver in the transducer waits for the returned echo signal
    and records changes in the ultrasound echo from the original
    emitted wave, specifically the receiver records:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the time between the ultrasound signal being emitted and
        the echo being received;</li>
    <li>the intensity of the echo;</li>
    <li>the frequency of the echo;</li>
    <li>the direction of the echo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently the signals are reconstructed to give an image.
    The vast majority of ultrasound systems focus the waves for
    processing <i>via</i> beamforming; a signal processing technique
    used for directional signal transmission. This formulates
    the ultrasound wave into an arc-shape and allows the focus
    to be set at a specific depth within the body.</p>
<p>The recorded information is fed to a central processing unit
    which has an array of pixels it uses to create the image.
    The time it takes for an echo to return determines which
    pixel is selected. The intensity of the echo determines the
    pixel brightness. Once all echoes have been processed, a
    greyscale image is constructed which subsequently can be
    displayed.</p>
<p>In principle, it is assumed the detected echo originates from
    the main ultrasound pulse and the echo returns after a single
    reflection. In clinical practice, this is not always the
    case and ultrasound imaging can be hindered by artifacts.
    For example, ultrasound pulses leave the transducer with
    a central beam and some off-axis lower energy beams called
    side lobes. If the side-lobe beam is reflected off a nearby
    surface it could be picked up by the detector. Another issue
    occurs when two highly reflective surfaces are close within
    the body; the echo may be reflected between the two surfaces
    multiple times before returning to the detector. This time
    delay would cause the central processing unit to place the
    echoes into pixels further away from the transducer than
    they are in reality. These effects can cause misleading information
    in scans about size and location of a scanned area / object.</p>
<p>Ultrasound images are relatively lower in resolution than other
    imaging methods. One reason for this is attenuation (see
    Figure 1) – the gradual loss of intensity of a wave when
    travelling through a medium. Attenuation causes the ultrasound
    wave to lose energy as it propagates, lowering the frequency
    of the signal. The amount of attenuation increases with higher
    frequencies and distances travelled. Ultrasound scanning
    is thus not a suitable technique to obtain high-resolution
    images from deep within the body.</p>
