<p>The term anatomy technically refers to the study of the
    structure of living organisms, at macroscopic and
    microscopic scale.</p>
<p>A clear hint as to why we have a whole section of the
    website dedicated to anatomy is found in the Greek
    origins of the word anatomy, literally meaning
    dissection. Clearly, understanding conditions and
    surgical treatment options (or lack of those) critically
    depends on knowledge about the structure, and thus the
    functioning, of the human body. Anatomy (the study of
    structure) and pathology (the study of diseases) are the
    building blocks of surgery. Â </p>
<p>Maxillofacial and head &amp; neck surgery is no exception
    to this rule, quite the opposite. No other region of the
    body is so densely packed with structures and functions
    as is the head &amp; neck region. In addition, <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive
        maxillofacial surgery</a> makes use of donor sites
    in other body regions.</p>
<p>The evolution of humankind is a slow process.
    Accordingly, there are <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy/further-reading">numerous
        established textbooks on human anatomy</a> that will
    not be outdated any time soon. There is little gain from
    adding to (and duplicating) some of the existing written
    and often very beautifully illustrated material, some
    examples are listed in the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy/further-reading">further-reading
        section</a>. Instead, for the purposes of this
    website we are going to demonstrate some of the anatomy
    aspects most relevant in maxillofacial and head &amp;
    neck surgery in short video clips, using anatomical
    models.</p>
