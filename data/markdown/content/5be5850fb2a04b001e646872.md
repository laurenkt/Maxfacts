<p>Pentoxifylline belongs to a class of chemicals known as xanthines
    (Figure 1). A number of xanthine derivatives naturally occur
    in range of body tissues, some mildly <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/overview">stimulating agents</a>    such as caffeine and theobromine (component of chocolate)
    also belong to this class of chemicals.</p>

<p>The only licensed medical use of pentoxifylline is for the treatment
    of peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication).
    In clinical dose, the substance has been shown to have effects
    on the rheology of blood and some properties of <a href="/treatment-other bleeding-level2">platelets and their aggregation behaviours</a>,
    mainly associated with reduction of the fibrinogen (a protein
    involved in blood coagulation) concentration in plasma leading
    to lower blood viscosity. Despite several decades of established
    use of pentoxifylline to treat peripheral arterial disease,
    only relatively poor-quality evidence exists supporting this
    indication.</p>
<p>A number of re-purposing and off-license uses of pentoxifylline
    continue to be reported. In particular, a broad range of
    conditions with fibrosis (scarring) of connective tissue
    as a common feature have been treated with pentoxifylline.
    This is the area that brings this drug into a degree of relevance
    to oral and maxillofacial surgery, particularly in relation
    to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis</a>.</p>
<p>As stated in a recent review (2016), the molecular biology underlying
    the various effects associated with pentoxifylline remain
    murky. The most common explanation points to a role of pentoxifylline
    as a non-specific inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase
    (for example, caffeine is such a non-specific inhibitor).
    This enzyme is important for the hydrolysis of cAMP (cyclic
    adenosine monophosphate) to AMP, an important signalling
    molecule for numerous cellular functions. However, this effect
    is only observed <i>in vitro</i> at concentrations approximately
    1000 times higher than in clinical plasma concentrations.
    The majority of cell biology experiments on pentoxifylline
    were all carried out at these unphysiological, high concentrations.
    Accordingly, any conclusions drawn from such experiments
    cannot be directly applied to the clinical properties of
    pentoxifylline (but unfortunately have been quoted as relevant
    for such circumstances).</p>
<p>Another much quoted effect of pentoxifylline (or its metabolites)
    is that it lowers the plasma concentration of inflammatory
    cytokines (messenger molecules), such as TNF-<i>α</i> (tumour
    necrosis factor <i>α</i>). Again, these observations are
    based on concentrations higher than those of clinical relevance.</p>
<p>Pentoxifylline is heavily metabolised when ingested or injected,
    with varied bioavailability for different methods of delivery.
    Therefore, it may not be unreasonable to ascribe some of
    the properties of the substance to its metabolites. For example,
    one of the metabolites (M1) has been shown to inhibit platelet
    aggregation and to increase blood flow. Such findings suggest
    that any conclusions drawn about properties and working mechanisms
    of pentoxifylline would need to consider carefully <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">different forms of administration</a>    (oral or intravenous) and dosage, rather than making global
    conjectures. In addition, obviously the effects of all of
    the active metabolites would need to be studied, separately
    and in combination.</p>
<p>In summary, the working principles of pentoxifylline under physiological
    conditions remain frankly unclear.</p>
<p>We discuss pentoxifylline here because it is one of the three
    components in the so called ‘triple therapy’ (or PENTOCLO),
    a controversial medication scheme promoted for the treatment
    of <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue/detailed">osteoradionecrosis</a>.
    Osteoradionecrosis is a severe long-term (lifelong) risk
    following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    in the head &amp; neck region. The cocktail of drugs consists
    of pentoxifylline, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/tocopherol">tocopherol</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/clodronate">clodronate</a>.
    The argument to include pentoxifylline in the cocktail is
    based on its assumed anti-inflammatory properties and its
    known effects on blood rheology. The evidence base about
    the working principles of this <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">medication scheme</a>    and the related hypotheses about the pathology of osteoradionecrosis
    are conflicted. It is worth mentioning that in the UK the
    National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
    only recommends PENTOCLO / ‘triple therapy’ for the treatment
    of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws in the framework of clinical
    trials but not otherwise.</p>
