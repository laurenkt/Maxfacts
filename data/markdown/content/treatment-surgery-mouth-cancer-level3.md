<p>Here we concentrate on surgical treatments for oral cancer. More
    extensive surgery will usually require reconstruction of
    the resulting defects. Reconstructive surgery in the head
    and neck region is a big topic of its own, not just in the
    context of surgical treatments of mouth cancer. Accordingly,
    there is a separate section dealing with <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>.</p>

<h1 id="some-general-aspects-of-surgical-treatment-of-mouth-cancer">Some general aspects of surgical treatment of mouth cancer</h1>
<p>Surgery can be confined to tumour ablation alone, with or without
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>.
    Where there is regional lymph node involvement, neck dissection
    (see below) is carried out at the same time. In many instances,
    reconstruction is simultaneous. If so, the surgery will be
    more extensive, in the form of a series of procedures (such
    as tracheostomy, neck dissection, access surgery, dental
    clearance, tumour ablation followed by immediate reconstruction
    and closure of the donor site). In such instances, a two
    team approach is preferred because the workload is shared,
    and the total anaesthetic time is reduced, with the flap
    being harvested at the same time as ablative surgery is performed.</p>
<h2>Airway</h2>
<p>There are several issues to consider as part of tumour resection.
    The airway must be secured during and after the surgery.
    If there is a significant risk to the airway, such as likely
    oral or neck swelling, a temporary tracheostomy should be
    performed. Figure 1 displays the equipment needed for a tracheostomy.</p>

        tube, syringe to inflate cuff. Bottom from left: connector
        and flexible connecting tube.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Access for tumour resection</h2>
<p>Adequate access is important as the presence of a positive margin
    adversely affects the outcome. Small anterior oral tumours
    can be approached through the mouth (peroral or transoral).
    Where better access is needed, surgical approaches such as
    lip split and access osteotomy (labiomandibulotomy, see Figure
    2) or a visor approach can be adopted.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Labiomandibulotomy (splitting
        the lip and mandible) allows three-dimensional access
        to posterior tumours.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Tumour resection</h2>
<p>The principal aim of ablative surgery with curative intent is
    the eradication of local disease by taking a margin of clinically
    normal tissue from all around the palpable edge of the tumour
    three-dimensionally. This is usually possible for most tumours.
    There needs to be a balance between achieving cure with extensive
    radical surgery at the price of significant mutilation versus
    an overly conservative approach resulting in insufficient
    tumour clearance in order to achieve better function. Most
    surgeons take a 1 cm normal tissue margin all around the
    tumour. On completion of the tumour resection, some surgeons
    take small specimens at selective margins for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">frozen sections analysis</a>.
    This analysis takes about 20 to 30 minutes. It is, however,
    dependent on the site(s) sampled. Moreover, frozen section
    interpretation is never as accurate as definitive histological
    (haematoxylin and eosin stains) examination, so the risk
    of false reassurance using this technique is ever present.
    Figure 3 shows an example of a defect left after resection
    of an oral squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed/figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The defect left after resection
        of oral squamous cell carcinoma.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some 70% of oral squamous cell carcinoma occurs in a U-shaped
    area around the mandible, floor of mouth and tongue. In some
    instances, lesions close to the mandible can be difficult
    to assess in terms of bone involvement. If frank invasion
    has taken place (clinically or on periosteal stripping),
    then the tumour is likely to have involved the medullary
    space (central cavity of bone). If the mandible is involved
    (by the cancer), it will need to be included in the resection.
    The functional sequelae arising from a segmental mandibular
    resection with discontinuity of the mandible are considerable,
    even if the mandible is reconstructed immediately. Where
    the tumour is close but not involving the bone, a rim of
    the mandible can be taken, leaving a preserved lower border.
    The reconstruction is usually simpler and has a better functional
    outcome.</p>
<p>Certain vital structures need preserving (the common and internal
    carotid arteries, which have a <i>ca</i>. 20 % risk of stroke
    if they are ligated, although this can be assessed pre- or
    even perioperatively, and the cavernous sinus (cavity at
    the skull base, containing several vital cranial nerves),
    which is not resectable). Cancers close to or involving such
    vital structures are usually advanced disease with a poor
    prognosis. This helps illustrate the need for careful preoperative
    assessment.</p>
<h2>Laser</h2>
<p>This method of <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">thermal surgery</a>    has a useful role in the treatment of premalignant lesions
    and early squamous cell carcinoma. A laser beam is used instead
    of a scalpel for the surgery. The laser beam can be projected
    in a noncontact manner through a handpiece with a focusing
    guide length (for example a carbon dioxide laser) or transmitted
    through a cable and cut on contact (a diode laser).</p>
<p>The laser wound is left unreconstructed (that is ‘raw’). Laser-technology
    advantages include a haemostatic effect (seals vessels smaller
    than 0.5 mm), less scarring and oedema and possibly less
    pain. The wound will epithelialize to leave a virtually normal-looking
    mucosa.</p>
<p>A similar result can be achieved using fine tip (Colorado needle)
    <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">cutting diathermy</a>    (producing heat locally by means of high-frequency alternating
    electric current) at significantly lower capital cost. Both
    techniques share a risk in that the surgical margin suffers
    from thermal artefacts. The status of the surgical margin
    is an important prognostic outcome. The presence of a close
    or positive (tumour present) margin considerably worsens
    the prognosis.</p>

<h2><a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/tors">Transoral robotic surgery (TORS)</a></h2>
<p>There are a small number of surgical robots in the world market.
    These are inevitably concentrated in the developed world,
    most obviously in North America. These robots were developed
    to gain better three-dimensional access to hard-to-reach
    areas of the body. Unsurprisingly, there has been interest
    in their use for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancers.
    Currently at the phase of use and reporting by enthusiasts,
    it will be interesting to see whether these expensive and
    complex machines demonstrate benefits to patients in terms
    of survival and resulting quality of life to balance the
    obvious costs.</p>
<h1 id="neck-dissection">Neck dissection</h1>
<p>The treatment, either to prevent spread of cancer to the lymph
    nodes or to remove established cancer, is some form of removal
    of lymph nodes. These nodes are present to act as a sieve
    to both capture and initiate an immune response to the cancer.
    There are many lymph nodes in the body and there is no evidence
    that the removal (of up to 100) of these nodes damages the
    immune response.</p>
<p>Over time views, both scientifically based and in terms of belief
    and experience of treating clinicians, have changed. Removal
    of all lymph nodes which carried substantial morbidity for
    the patient (radical neck dissection, see below) is reserved
    for extensive, proven spread of cancer to the neck. Selective
    neck dissection (see below), where only some of the lymph
    nodes are removed with preservation of other important structures,
    is used ‘prophylactically’ (when it may – or possible may
    not be beneficial) and for small nodal deposits. In cases
    where there is only a suspicion that the cancer may have
    spread a ‘sentinel lymph node biopsy’ (see below) may be
    carried out. This involves identifying the lymph node most
    at risk of a particular cancer spreading to it by radioactive
    tracer injection. If this node is not involved, no further
    surgery is needed. If the lymph node is involved, the patient
    has to return a week or two later to have a neck dissection.
    Although approved by NICE in the UK, there remains a great
    deal of uncertainty amongst clinicians about whether or not
    this is in the best interest of patients as both the logistics
    and the results have not been definitively established.</p>
<p>The gold standard technique to achieve regional control of the
    neck surgically is the radical neck dissection (removal of
    lymphatics and fat in all five levels in the neck, see Figure
    5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed/figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The cervical lymph node distribution
        in the neck:</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li>level I - submandibular and submental nodes</li>
    <li>level II – upper jugular chain from skull base to level of
        hyoid (small bone below floor of mouth)</li>
    <li>level III – midjugular chain from level of hyoid to lower
        border of cricoid (cartilage around windpipe, middle
        of neck)</li>
    <li>level IV – lower jugular chain from cricoid to clavicle (collar
        bone)</li>
    <li>level V – from posterior sternomastoid (muscle along sides
        of neck) edge to anterior edge of trapezius (another
        muscle) from skull base to clavicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are significant side effects associated with the
    radical neck dissection (see Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed/figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> This patient has had bilateral
        neck dissections. The morbidity caused by the radical
        neck dissection is evident in the drooping shoulder,
        loss of neck volume and symptoms of shoulder pain, stiffness
        and anaesthesia. The side that underwent selective neck
        dissection (see below) is much less morbid.</figcaption>

<p>The different types of neck dissection have been classified to
    standardize terminology. The surgical treatment of the neck
    can be divided into elective and therapeutic neck dissections.</p>
<p>The classification of neck dissections, relevant for oral cancer
    treatment, distinguishes two main categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Comprehensive dissection (removes all five levels of neck
        lymph nodes)</li>
    <li>Selective dissection (removes only some of the levels of
        neck lymph nodes; preserves many structures)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two categories have subcategories as is tabulated below.</p>

<p>*Only used in the treatment of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers,
    not used for oral cancers</p>
<p>The most commonly chosen approach for the neck with negative
    clinical findings among patients with head and neck squamous
    cell carcinoma is selective neck dissection as a staging
    or therapeutic surgical procedure. The reason comes from
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">Lindberg</a>    who demonstrated in 1972 that in patients with carcinoma
    of the oral cavity (tongue, floor of mouth) the lymph nodes
    most frequently involved were</p>
<ul>
    <li>submandibular (level I)</li>
    <li>jugulodigastric (level II)</li>
    <li>midjugular (level III)</li>
</ul>
<p>The low jugular (level IV) and posterior triangle (level V) lymph
    nodes were rarely involved. The same study demonstrated that
    the lymph nodes most frequently involved in patients with
    carcinoma of the oropharynx were the jugulodigastric (level
    II) in all sites, including potential bilateral involvement.
    The nodes of the submandibular or submental (level I) triangles
    were seldom involved in patients with oropharyngeal carcinomas.
    Lindberg also noted that the squamous cell carcinomas arising
    from the base of the tongue frequently metastasised to both
    sides of the neck.</p>
<p>A retrospective analysis in 1990 by <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">Shah</a>    of 1119 radical neck dissection specimens reported the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the submental (level IA), submandibular (level IB), jugulodigastric
        (level II) and midjugular (level III) lymph nodes were
        at highest risk for metastases from squamous cell carcinoma
        of the oral cavity</li>
    <li>the jugulodigastric (level II), midjugular (level III) and
        lower jugular (level IV) lymph nodes were at highest
        risk for metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of theoropharynx,
        hypopharynx and larynx.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">Davidson</a> in
    1993 reported a 3 % incidence of histologically positive
    posterior triangle (level V) lymph nodes in a retrospective
    study of 1277 neck dissections in patients with head and
    neck squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
<p><strong>Elective neck dissection</strong> is performed when there
    is no clinical evidence of involved lymph nodes in the neck.
    It is a useful staging procedure. These procedures tend to
    be selective (only taking the high-risk groups of lymph nodes
    in order to minimise side effects and therefore improve function).
    As many structures in the neck which are not involved in
    the spread of malignant disease as possible are retained.
    Although originally introduced as a staging procedure, the
    selective (elective) neck dissection, removing levels I to
    IV has become the therapeutic standard in patients with
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">N0 stage</a> malignancy and low-volume node-positive neck
        when treating oral and oropharyngeal cancer surgically.</p>
<p>Interestingly this is not universally applied and may reflect
    the particular UK influence on the role of level IV lymph
    nodes – anatomical versus radiological definition, relationship
    to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">‘skip lesions’</a>    and consistency in technique and training in ‘selective neck
    dissection’.</p>
<p>German practice for squamous cell carcinomas consists of a neck
    dissection of levels I-III as a standard procedure. If the
    tumour is strictly on one side close to the body of the mandible
    or the lateral border of the tongue, it is performed only
    unilaterally and expanded to the other side and level V on
    the ipsilateral side only in cases of positive lymph nodes,
    proven by frozen sections. If the tumour is located anteriorly
    in the mouth or behind the molars, neck dissection level
    I-III is conducted on both sides and expanded to level V
    if the frozen sections in level II or III are positive.</p>
<p>This is clearly a different oncological strategy and based on
    a different premise and available resource (for example ready
    availability and reliance on perioperative frozen section).</p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic neck dissection</strong> is performed when
    it is strongly suspected, or known, that there is disease
    in the neck (enlarged lymph nodes by clinical or radiological
    criteria, or positive findings from <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">fine-needle biopsy</a>).
    In order to achieve good control, some surgeons may perform
    comprehensive neck dissection (taking all five levels of
    lymph nodes in the neck and usually including at least some
    of the noninvolved anatomical structures; modified radical
    neck dissections types I to III; see Table 1). However, in
    small-volume neck disease, it is reasonable to perform selective
    neck dissection as described above: if postoperative radiotherapy
    is indicated, the survival and recurrence figures are no
    different and the morbidity of  selective neck dissection
    is less than that associated with radical neck dissection.</p>
<p>In many maxillofacial surgical oncological practices it is now
    more common to perform an extended modified radical neck
    dissection (hyper-radical, including skin or other structures
    in one area but preserving a viable structure, perhaps the
    accessory nerve, in another) than the classical radical (block)
    neck dissection.</p>
<p>A ‘positive neck’ is the one with clinical or radiological evidence
    of disease in neck lymph nodes. There is no randomised controlled
    evidence that would clearly define the best treatment for
    patients with a clinically node-positive neck. Patients with
    clinical <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">stage N1 disease</a>    should be treated by appropriate neck dissection, or by radical
    radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Patients with
    clinical <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">stage N2 or N3 disease</a>    should be treated by comprehensive neck dissection and external
    beam radiotherapy, or by radical radiotherapy and comprehensive
    neck dissection. The difference in approach is very variable
    primarily because of logistics, not evidence. The only agreement
    is that both modalities together have a higher survival rate.</p>
<p>Elective neck dissection is a controversial area, in particular
    for early-stage oral cancer. A possible disadvantage of leaving
    a neck alone and operating only when it becomes involved
    clinically is that positive neck findings carry a poorer
    prognosis because the disease is more advanced, a consequence
    of the detection of disease in the neck often coming when
    it has reached the N2 stage. The disadvantages of neck dissection
    include unnecessary surgical morbidity (if found to be negative
    pathologically), a claimed 1% risk of mortality (this may
    well be a significant overestimate) and inefficient use of
    resources.</p>
<p>Alternatives to elective neck dissection (when no disease is
    demonstrable clinically or radiologically) include a watch
    and wait policy, close monitoring with regular ultrasound-guided
    fine-needle biopsy (problem with follow-up compliance) and,
    currently on trial, sentinel lymph node biopsy (only investigating
    the lymph nodes most likely to be affected), though this
    has been shown to have poor sensitivity in occult disease.</p>
<p>Adjuvant radiotherapy is given to the primary tumour site where
    there is tumour present at the margins, close to the margins,
    high grade dysplasia/carcinoma <i>in situ</i> at the margins
    on histological analysis, bone invasion (stage T4 by definition)
    or large tumours. Adjuvant radiotherapy is given to the neck
    following neck dissection where there is extracapsular spread,
    multiple intracapsular disease (more than two lymph nodes
    positive) or soft tissue disease or positive margins.</p>
