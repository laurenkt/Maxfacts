<h1 id="a-brief-summary-of-salivary-gland-anatomy">A brief summary of salivary gland anatomy</h1>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more detail about location and structure
        of the salivary glands, this information is in our section
        about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The <strong>parotid gland</strong> consists almost entirely of
    serous acini (cells that produce serous (watery) fluid; see
    below about physiology). The gland lies in the retromandibular
    fossa (near the angle of the mandible and in front of the
    ear) and has three surfaces. Its <i>lateral</i> surface is
    located subcutaneously and is enveloped in a tight fascia
    (connective tissue). This fascia is related to the subcutaneous
    musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS layer: a fairly inelastic
    layer of fibres and muscles in the deep skin layers of face
    and neck), with the greater auricular nerve branching anteriorally
    (in the front) into the skin and to the posterior (to the
    back) to the lobe of the ear. Its <i>anterior</i> surface
    wraps around the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible
    (the part of the mandible rising from the mandibular body,
    posterior to the molar teeth) and abuts the masseter and
    medial pterygoid muscles (cheek muscles). The <i>deep</i>    surface of the parotid gland is complex and is related to
    the mastoid process (a space at the base of the skull, behind
    the ear), the posterior belly of the digastric muscle (small
    muscle under the jaw), the styloid process (small bone beneath
    the ear) and its associated muscles and ligaments, and the
    external carotid artery. Figure 1 shows <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    views of the parotid glands from two different angles.</p>

<p>Within the parotid gland, the facial nerve branches into an upper
    and lower division from which stem the five named major branches.
    The nerve separates the gland into its superficial and deep
    lobes (see Figure 2). There is no natural tissue plane here
    and the nerve should be thought of as being embedded in the
    substance of the gland. Also within the gland are the retromandibular
    vein, external carotid artery, lymph nodes and filaments
    from the auriculotemporal nerve.</p>

        facial nerve separates the gland into ‘deep’ and ’superficial’
        lobes, there is no fascial compartmentalisation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A 5 cm duct from the parotid gland lies on the superficial surface
    of the masseter muscle. It opens into the mouth opposite
    the second upper molar tooth. It is also known as Stensen’s
    duct. In about 50 % of people a small accessory parotid lies
    between the duct and the zygomatic arch (cheek bone).</p>
<p>The <strong>submandibular gland</strong> is a mixed serous and
    mucinous gland (it produces a mixture of serous and mucus-rich
    secretion; see below). It is comprised of a large superficial
    lobe and a smaller deep lobe which is in continuity with
    the superficial lobe as it wraps around the posterior border
    of the mylohyoid muscle (running from the mandible down to
    the hyoid bone (a flat U-shaped bone in the middle-front
    of the neck). The gland is covered by a fibrous capsule.
    Figure 3 shows an excised submandibular gland.</p>

        gland, separated by the free edge of the mylohyoid muscle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The mandibular branch of the facial nerve is quoted to dip below
    the lower border of the mandible in 20 % of people. The lingual
    nerve is intimately related to the submandibular duct (also
    known as Wharton’s duct) as the duct makes an upward and
    anterior course into the floor of the mouth. The lingual
    nerve is attached, by two branches, to the submandibular
    ganglion which lies in the gland.</p>
<p>The <strong>sublingual glands</strong> are mucinous glands (producing
    mucus-rich secretion) which lie on the mylohyoid muscle and
    are covered superficially by the mucosa (lining) of the floor
    of the mouth. Rather than one duct, they have several small
    ducts which open directly into the mouth and also into the
    submandibular duct. Their intimate relation to the lingual
    nerve and submandibular duct mean these are potentially at
    risk of injury during surgery (see Figure 4).</p>

<h1 id="a-brief-summary-of-salivary-gland-physiology">A brief summary of salivary gland physiology</h1>
<p>The physiological role of the salivary glands is summarised by
    their name: the production of saliva. This may sound simple
    enough but in reality the production and the roles of different
    kinds of saliva are both complicated and diverse. Generally
    speaking, saliva is a multi-purpose fluid of variable viscosity.
    Saliva is mostly water but the small (variable) percentage
    content of electrolytes, enzymes and other proteins (mainly
    glycoproteins) makes all the difference to the physiological
    properties of different types of saliva.</p>
<p>By and large, the main tasks for saliva in humans are to</p>
<ul>
    <li>maintain oral health</li>
    <li>enable eating</li>
    <li>enable speaking (by keeping the mouth moist)</li>
</ul>
<p>In some other animals, saliva has further physiological tasks:
    for example, dogs have very little capacity to cool their
    body by sweating, so evaporating saliva from the tongue instead
    of sweating helps in that regard; the electrolytes in saliva
    provide an important mechanism for buffering and pre-digestion
    in ruminant animals such as cows and sheep.</p>
<p>In most animals, including humans, the various salivary glands
    produce different types of saliva for different purposes.
    In humans these are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>parotid glands – serous / watery saliva with a high content
        of alpha-amylase, a protein that helps to break down
        starch in foods; at rest (that is: when not eating) saliva
        production in the parotid glands is minimal</li>
    <li>submandibular glands – mixture of watery and viscous saliva;
        produced at rest</li>
    <li>sublingual glands – predominantly viscous saliva; produced
        at rest</li>
</ul>
<p>The autonomic nerve system (not under intentional control) regulates
    the type and amount of saliva being produced. For example,
    the presence of food in the mouth and chewing, the smell
    of food, or just thinking about food can trigger the production
    of serous saliva from the parotid glands (hence the proverbial
    mouth-watering food).</p>
<p>The roles and tasks of non-viscous and viscous saliva can be
    roughly subdivided as follows:</p>
<p><i>non-viscous saliva</i> from the parotid glands mainly solubilises
    and breaks down food (in particular starch) and enables taste
    in this way; electrolytes provide buffering (help regulating
    and stabilising the pH, that is levels of acidity)</p>
<p><i>viscous saliva</i> from the submandibular and sublingual glands
    lubricates foods, helps to form a slippery bolus of food
    (easy to swallow lump of food) and protects the mucosa from
    mechanical damage. In addition, the viscous saliva protects
    teeth: for example, the enzyme lysozyme in viscous saliva
    is a potent natural antibacterial agent that is essential
    in protecting teeth against decay. Again, electrolytes provide
    buffering and also protect teeth against damage, for example
    from acidic foods.</p>

<h1 id="the-diagnostic-toolbox-for-investigating-the-salivary-glands">The diagnostic toolbox for investigating the salivary glands</h1>
<p>There is some diagnostic role here for plain X-ray radiographs,
    in particular in conjunction with taking a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">sialogram</a>    to image the architecture of the ductal system of the salivary
    glands by using plain X-ray images, enhanced by contrast
    agent injected locally.</p>
<p>If there is a lump, imaging of the nature of the lump is required.
    A variety of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI scans</a>    are the best modality. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">Ultrasound imaging</a>    investigations in experienced hands can be quite satisfactory
    too, as can be <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a>    for obtaining more detailed X-ray information.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">Fine needle aspiration cytology</a>    is usually a simple (but often painful to the patient) procedure
    and may provide support to a provisional diagnosis if malignancy
    or a cystic lesion is suspected on imaging.</p>
<p>Open or core <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a> of
    lumps of the major salivary glands has been decried in the
    past. This was due to the perceived risk of seeding tumour,
    in fact no hard data supports this concern. Core biopsy is
    acceptable and the tissue can be subjected to a variety of
    immunohistochemical tests which may save the patient from
    more invasive treatment. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">Ultrasound scan guided</a>    core biopsy of both salivary and cervical (neck) lumps carries
    the highest level of diagnostic accuracy under trial conditions.
    Whether that translates into routine clinical practice remains
    to be seen.</p>
<p>Examination of the constituents of saliva has no role in routine
    clinical practice.</p>
<p>Methods exist to measure salivary flow rates but their interpretation
    is difficult and the results, although used in research protocols,
    have little bearing on clinical practice.</p>
