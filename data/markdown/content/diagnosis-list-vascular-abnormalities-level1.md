<p>The terms ‘vascular abnormalities’ or ‘vascular anomalies’ cover
    a mixed group of congenital (sporadic as well as inherited),
    developmental vascular malformations. These are the most
    common congenital malformations (‘birthmarks’), affecting
    approximately one in 22 children. They predominantly (approximately
    60 %) occur in the head and neck region, the oral cavity
    (mouth) is frequently involved, and skin and/or mucosa (lining
    of the mouth) may be affected. There may be additional soft
    tissue abnormalities. It is worth noting that another common
    type of congenital malformation, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/detailed">cysts</a>    also predominantly affect the head and neck region.</p>
<p>The majority of these lesions are harmless and do not require
    treatment or only need minimal interventions. However, severe
    forms of vascular malformations may require radical interventions.</p>
<p>The exact diagnosis of the type and extent of a vascular abnormality
    not only requires the careful consideration of the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">examination</a>,
    but typically needs to consider the results of a range of
    imaging investigations. For these soft tissue lesions, a
    range of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> imaging
    techniques are the most suitable and most widely used diagnostic
    tools. The exact characterisation of some complicated and
    extended vascular malformations in the head and neck region,
    as well as in other body parts, requires sometimes sophisticated
    imaging modalities that are capable of showing flow of liquids.</p>
<p>Exact diagnosis and characterisation of extensive vascular abnormalities
    is important because this informs the choice of the most
    suitable <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities">management and treatment options</a>.
    These options vary strongly, depending on the type, location
    and size of the lesion. In addition, vascular abnormalities
    very rarely may be one expression of a more profound syndrome,
    similar to the findings that <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate/detailed">cleft lip and palate</a>    sometimes are only one of several aspects of a more <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies/detailed">general condition or syndrome</a>.
    Such causes of vascular abnormalities need to be excluded,
    or confirmed, over the process of arriving at a diagnosis.</p>
<p>The broad range of lesions affecting the vascular structures
    of the body are classified according to the structures affected.
    Broadly, these lesions are divided into two main categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li>vascular tumours (including haemangioma);</li>
    <li>vascular malformations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haemangioma</strong> is a normally benign tumour of the
    lining of a blood vessel (endothelium), may not be present
    at birth but rapidly growing in early infancy and resolving
    spontaneously later in childhood. Haemangioma is the most
    common, benign childhood tumour. It affects approximately
    10 % of white infants, for example. Haemangioma in most cases
    will be managed by ‘watch and wait’.</p>
<p><strong>Vascular malformations</strong> are present at birth,
    grow at the same rate as the infant and will typically not
    resolve spontaneously. Vascular malformations can affect
    the lymphatic system, the veins (venous malformations), arteries
    and veins (arteriovenous malformations) or may be limited
    to the small, peripheral blood vessels (capillary malformations).
    These lesions are further subdivided into low-flow and high-flow
    malformations, depending on the flow rate in the affected
    vessels.</p>
