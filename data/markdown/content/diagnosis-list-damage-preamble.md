<p>In conventional terms most maxillofacial trauma is divided into
    hard (fractures or broken bones) and soft tissue trauma (generally
    everything else but most frequently referring to skin injuries).</p>
<p>This section deals with the slightly unusual category of “damage
    other than fractures”. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">Fractures</a>    are discussed separately. We will outline the cause, signs
    and symptoms of a number, usually traumatic, conditions which
    result in damage to soft tissues of the mouth, jaws, face,
    scalp and neck. Sometimes the injuries will be combined with
    underlying hard tissue injuries.</p>
<p>Such injuries include lacerations (serious cuts and tears), burst
    wounds, explosive wounds and burns. They are described, by
    convention, either as the injury received (lacerations) or
    by the mechanism of the injury (blast wounds or burns for
    example).</p>
