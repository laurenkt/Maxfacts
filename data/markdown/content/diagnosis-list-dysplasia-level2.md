<h1 id="oral-mucosal-lesions-associated-with-dysplasia">Oral mucosal lesions associated with dysplasia</h1>
<h2>Leukoplakia</h2>
<p>Oral leukoplakia (according to the World Health Organisation
    definition) is a white patch or plaque that cannot be characterised,
    clinically or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histopathologically</a>,
    as any other disease. There are a number of possible causes
    for white patch <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">oral mucosal lesions</a>    and similar looking such lesions are quite common. Leukoplakic
    patches can appear in all areas of the mouth but the side
    of the tongue and the floor of the mouth (see Figure 1) are
    common locations. Leukoplakic patches come in a range of
    appearances and may be completely asymptomatic or cause symptoms.
    The overall risk for leukoplakic patches to become malignant
    has been quoted as 2 to 8 %.</p>

        mouth.</figcaption>

<h2>Erythroplakia</h2>
<p>Erythroplakia is defined as a red patch (see Figure 2) that cannot
    be diagnosed as any other lesion. Erythroplakia is less common
    than leukoplakia but tends to display more severe degrees
    of dysplasia as well as a higher overall risk of malignant
    transformation; the overall risk has been quoted as 14 to
    67 % (see below), and approximately 40 to 50 % of erythroplakic
    patches have high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma <i>in situ</i>    present. The most common sites for erythroplakia are the
    floor of the mouth, tongue and soft palate.</p>

<h2>Erythroleukoplakia</h2>
<p>Erythroleukoplakia (also known as speckled leukoplakia) is the
    third of the oral mucosal lesions commonly associated with
    a risk of malignant transformation (see Figure 3). Speckled
    leukoplakia is an intermediate risk for malignant transformation.</p>

<h2>Submucous fibrosis</h2>
<p>Submucous fibrosis is a progressive lesion forming bands of scarred
    tissue (fibrosis) beneath the mucosa (see Figure 4). Submucous
    fibrosis is associated with epithelial dysplasia and a quoted
    risk for malignant transformation of approximately 5 %. The
    strands of scarred tissue (fibrosed bands) can lead to severe
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> (difficulty
    opening the mouth). Submucous fibrosis is strongly associated
    with chewing habits of areca nuts, gutka and betel – common
    on the Indian subcontinent.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> An example of submucous fibrosis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Lichen planus</h2>
<p>Lichen planus is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the skin and
    often affects the oral mucosa as well. It usually shows characteristic
    streaks or strands of white keratosis (see Figure 5). Lichen
    planus is sometimes associated with epithelial dysplasia,
    a so called lichenoid dysplasia . Of the fairly low malignant
    transformation risk (the incidence is approximately 1 to
    3 %), the majority of cases is due to lichenoid dysplasia.
    It is important to note that the real risk of transformation
    of lichenoid dysplasia and erosive lichen planus warrants
    intervention whereas reticular pattern lichen planus that
    is symptomless doesn’t need anything in the way of intervention.
    This is fortunate given how common that condition is.</p>

<h2>Other lesions associated with malignant transformation</h2>
<p>Other oral lesions associated with malignant transformation include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>chronic hyperplastic candidiasis (rare form of otherwise
        common oral <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">fungal infection</a>        with typically <i>candida albicans</i> which may lead
        to persistent white lesions, even after treatment with
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antifungal agents</a>;
        most commonly observed in conjunction with heavy smoking
        habits; such lesions have been reported to be associated
        with an increased risk for malignant transformation);</li>
    <li>sideropenic dysphagia (also known as Paterson-Kelly or Plummer-Vinson
        syndrome; a rare genetic iron-deficiency anaemia condition,
        leading to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>        (difficulty swallowing) and painful glossitis (a raw
        appearance suggestive of inflammation of the tongue);
        known to be associated with an increased risk for malignancy
        developing in the oral cavity, oesophagus (gullet) and
        hypopharynx (part of the throat linking to the gullet));</li>
    <li>dyskeratosis congenita and epidermolysis bullosa (two rare
        hereditary conditions affecting males; white patches
        on the back of the tongue may develop, similar in appearance
        to leukoplakia; malignant transformation of such patches
        has been reported in the literature);</li>
    <li>discoid lupus erythematosus (a chronic autoimmune condition;
        has been associated with lip cancer rather than cancers
        of the oral cavity);</li>
    <li>actinic keratosis (a condition of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">skin</a>,
        caused by long-term and/or intense exposure to UV radiation
        (sun light); also affects the lip, especially the lower
        lip (also known as farmer’s or sailor’s lip) and may
        transform to lip cancer).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading and progression</h2>
<p>Great caution has to be used when defining ‘premalignant lesions’
    which affect the epithelial cells (the cells making up the
    lining of the mouth and other body cavities). The implication
    is that this can lead to and will often precede the most
    common form of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oral cancer</a>,
    squamous cell carcinoma, which originates from epithelial
    cells. This would be a useful, simple, understandable sequence
    of events which would enable, in fact mandate, early intervention
    to address every dysplastic lesion. Unfortunately (or arguably
    fortunately as they are so common) it’s not true.</p>
<p>There is some evidence:</p>
<ul>
    <li>individual cases, where over time dysplastic tissue gradually
        undergoes malignant change;</li>
    <li>both leukoplakia and erythroplakia have been observed in
        the margins of confirmed oral squamous cell carcinoma;</li>
    <li>some typical changes in morphology as well as cytology are
        common between the premalignant lesions and established
        epithelial malignancies;</li>
    <li>some typical genetic and molecular fingerprints of invasive
        oral cancers are also found in premalignant lesions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fundamental problem centres around definitions of mild/moderate
    dysplasia and whether these <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histopathological conditions</a>,
    whether or not they are clinically obvious as white or red
    patches, actually progress or are static or even spontaneously
    resolving.</p>
<p>Severe dysplasia  is characterised by increasingly more severe
    levels of abnormality at cell and tissue levels. Whereas
    considerable controversy exists as to what exactly defines
    mild and moderate dysplasia and whether it is possible on
    histopathological grounds to meaningfully predict progress,
    severe forms of dysplasia, where in particular the characteristics
    at cellular level become increasingly abnormal, is a condition
    where greater consensus exists. In fact, some pathologists
    will argue that there is no, or hardly any, distinction between
    a severe case of dysplasia and a carcinoma <i>in situ</i>    (an early form of establishment of a malignant epithelial
    lesion). Such blurred boundaries between developmental stages
    are illustrated in Figure 6.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-dysplasia-level2-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Top: an area of leukoplakia that
        became indurated (hardened) and was found to be early
        squamous cell carcinoma on histological examination after
        excision; middle and bottom: two examples of early oral
        squamous cell carcinoma.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such a model of a perfectly orderly progression over time may
    well suggest that it is straightforward to assess the stage
    of the process and then select the most appropriate treatment
    option(s) accordingly. Unfortunately, matters are considerably
    more complicated. For example, there seems to be no direct
    correlation between the severity of the dysplasia and the
    risk of a malignant transformation of the lesion. Location
    of the lesion, environmental factors (smokers / non-smokers),
    age, diet and many more factors all contribute, making it
    difficult to predict the most likely course of events (and
    time scales of developments). It is more telling to observe
    how lesion and dysplasia evolve over time, rather than just
    thinking about the severity of the dysplasia as the only
    determining factor.</p>
<p>Many lesions with mild to moderate dysplasia never progress to
    a malignant condition. Even some cases of severe dysplasia
    may not progress. One possible explanation for this observation
    is offered by genetics, known as the two-hit hypothesis.
    It is mostly down to specialised genes, tumour suppressor
    genes (for example gene p53), to protect against the development
    and establishment of malignant cell lines. The chromosomes
    that carry all the necessary information are present in pairs
    in our cells, so there is always one back-up copy if one
    copy in one of the chromosomes is damaged by some kind of
    mutation and no longer provides an active tumour suppressor
    gene. As long as the second copy of the gene is not knocked
    out by another mutagenic event, cells and body continue to
    function normally and prevent malignancy from developing.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that the management and <a href="/treatment/surgery/dysplasia">treatment of premalignant lesions</a>    can be controversial. The approaches vary considerably and
    range from ‘wait and watch’ policies all the way to far more
    aggressive policies that advocate the excision of all premalignant
    lesions wherever possible. It will be undoubtedly helpful
    if, in the future, better predictions will become possible
    based on grade and type of dysplasia than is currently possible.</p>
