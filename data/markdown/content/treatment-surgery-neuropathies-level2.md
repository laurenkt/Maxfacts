<p>Surgical intervention for nerve damage is essentially to
    release compressing or constricting pressure.</p>
<p>This can be by removing bone compressing a swollen nerve
    (this is often better achieved medically by short term
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroids
        or a steroid injection</a>) or by removing expanded
    bone such as in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/detailed">fibrous
        dysplasia</a> or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/detailed">Paget’s
        disease</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps more often it is by removing scar tissue around a
    nerve that has been caught up in fibrous tissue during
    healing after trauma or surgery. This is known as
    neurolysis and is essentially the removal of dense scar
    tissue while keeping the residual nerve intact and by
    making incisions along the direction of the nerve in any
    scar tissue which can not be safely removed from around
    the nerve.</p>
<p>The key to understanding what can be achieved in terms of
    nerve damage beyond compression lies in what has gone
    wrong and what it is surgically feasible to correct or
    improve. Figure 1 gives a schematic overview of the
    classification of nerve damage and the corresponding
    anatomical pathophysiology.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The most useful
        nerve damage classifications (Seddon, Sunderland)
        with diagrams illustrating the relative degrees of
        damage, from ‘stunning’ an intact nerve to complete
        sectioning and degeneration. Included is the
        corresponding everyday clinical descriptive
        terminology: neuropraxia (temporary loss of
        conduction of a motor or sensory nerve without
        degeneration), axonotmesis (nerve injury with
        variable degrees of damage to the axons and myelin
        sheath, with at least the epineurium intact),
        neurotmesis (most severe grade of nerve injury, a
        completely severed nerve and nerve sheath),
        Wallerian degeneration (degenerative process
        following nerve injury).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The overview in Figure 1 highlights simultaneously the
    sheet / layer structure of nerves (endoneurium,
    perineurium, epineurium) as the basis of classification
    of damage as well as the resulting functional disruption
    to nerve conduction capacity as a function of damage to
    these structures. This is in addition to the
    physiological response and degenerative process
    (Wallerian degeneration) that follows damage to
    peripheral nerves and further hinders nerve conduction
    outward from the injury), similar to some of the effects
    occurring in some neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>For the most part all that can be realistically achieved
    under a microscope is to align without tension the
    macroscopic nerve by suturing the surrounding soft
    tissue, the epineurium (Figure 2).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Schematic of
        epineural suturing technique.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In very large nerves it may be possible to align the
    nerve fascicles to such an extent that perineurium
    suturing is possible (Figure 3).  </p>

        perineural suturing technique.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If it is not possible to reconnect severed nerve endings
    without tension, it may be necessary to bridge a gap by
    using a nerve graft. An example is shown in Figure 4
    where surgical damage to the facial nerve from removal
    of a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other/more-info">schwannoma</a>
    is repaired by a nerve graft, in this case from the
    nearby greater auricular nerve. This trades a
    permanently numb earlobe and side of neck for a
    possibility (perhaps a 30 % chance) of some recovery of
    useful function in the branches of the facial nerve.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-neuropathies-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> This patient had
        an undiagnosed mass in the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">parotid
            gland</a>, with inconclusive <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> and
        fine-needle aspiration <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>
        results. After considerable discussion he was
        adamant that the mass be removed come what may. Top
        left: at operation the surgeon was faced with a mass
        completely involving the facial nerve, despite the
        fact that the nerve was functioning. On the basis of
        the pre-operative discussion and consent, the tumour
        was excised and reconstructed with a greater
        auricular (top right, arrowed – different patient)
        nerve graft. Bottom left: actual graft shown; bottom
        right: excised schwannoma.</figcaption>

<p>Nerve grafting is typically a choice of the lesser evil
    as it creates a donor-site defect for sometimes not so
    great benefit, but on the other hand sometimes there is
    huge benefit. Typical donor sites for nerve grafts in
    maxillofacial surgery are the greater auricular nerve
    and the sural nerve (in the lower leg). As with many
    aspects of highly specialised surgery there are centres
    which gain a large volume of experience, create
    specialist teams with rare resource and by virtue of
    that, maximise experience. These centres have published
    results which are substantially better than the
    experience of surgeons who do not routinely perform
    nerve grafting.</p>
<p>In all cases beyond simple neuropraxia (temporary loss of
    nerve conduction, Sunderland Class 1; see Figure 1)
    where the axon is intact but ‘stunned’ there is axonal
    degeneration (Wallerian degeneration) back to its origin
    in the brain or spinal cord. It then has to grow back
    out to the most distant site it previously reached for
    sensation or motor activity to return to the pre-injured
    state. The greater the damage to the ‘tunnel’ it has to
    grow along, the less likely that process will be fully
    and easily accomplished.</p>
<p>One way of looking at this is the axon as a rail track
    and the remaining nerve structures (myelin and myelin
    secreting cells, connective tissue, endoneurium) as a
    tunnel. A main nerve is a group of tunnels stuck
    together by perineurium and a major nerve consists of
    several groups of tunnels wrapped in epineurium. The
    best microsurgery may align at a perineural level, so
    the chances of some of the train tracks (the axons)
    ending up in a different place from before is quite
    high.</p>
<p>Microneurosurgical anastomosis of even quite large
    peripheral nerves appears technically easier than <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">microvascular
        surgical anastomosis</a> but the functional results
    are rarely as good.</p>
