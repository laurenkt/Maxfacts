<p>Postoperative problems affecting the thyroid (gland in the neck)
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Residual function of the gland being too high or too low.</li>
    <li>Scar. Usually very aesthetic, lying in a skin crease across
        the neck. Special staples are often used in case they
        need to be removed quickly.</li>
    <li>Bleeding. The thyroid gland is very vascular and bleeding
        after the operation can compress the underlying windpipe.
        This is why easy to remove staples are popular.</li>
    <li>Accidental damage or removal of the underlying parathyroid
        glands (four tiny glands located near the thyroid gland;
        parathyroid glands produce a hormone (PTH) which controls
        Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate levels in blood; important
        for functioning of nerves, muscles and bones), leading
        to disturbances in calcium ion and phosphate levels in
        the blood.</li>
    <li>Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, leaving a hoarse
        voice.</li>
    <li>Minor difficulties in swallowing.</li>
</ul>
