<h1 id="composition-of-saliva">Composition of saliva</h1>
<p>Saliva is a very nearly neutral (that is neither alkaline nor
    acidic) aqueous solution. Like all body fluids it contains
    a number of electrolytes (that is inorganic ions) such as
    Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>    cations, and Cl<sup>-</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,
    PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup> and F<sup>-</sup>    anions. Saliva is super-concentrated as far as Ca<sup>2+</sup>    and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions are concerned and in
    this way prevents teeth dissolving in this aqueous electrolyte
    solution. The electrolytes, in particular HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,
    act as a buffer (that is they balance and maintain the pH
    value such that there are no large pH fluctuations).</p>
<p>Organic components of saliva include a large number of proteins.
    Of the proteins in saliva amylase, statherin and mucins are
    mostly relevant for the process of chewing, tasting and swallowing
    but also play a role in maintaining oral health.</p>

<p>Other proteins such as lysozyme or lactoferrin are important
    for the role of saliva in protecting teeth and oral health
    in general.</p>
<h1 id="functional-organic-components-of-saliva-relevant-for-oral-health"><a href="/help/oral-hygiene/further-reading">Functional organic components of saliva relevant for oral health</a></h1>
<p>The two most important proteins in saliva for the protection
    of oral health are lysozyme and lactoferrin. Further proteins
    in saliva such as <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">mucins, amylase and statherin</a>    have their primary role in enabling chewing, eating and swallowing
    as well as a second role in maintaining oral health.</p>
<h3>Lysozyme</h3>
<p>Lysozyme is a large protein molecule, it belongs to the class
    of enzymes (proteins that enable specific chemical reactions
    in living cells). The role of lysozyme in maintaining oral
    health is defined by its ability to fight bacteria, lysozyme
    is a part of our bodies’ defence mechanisms, the immune system.
    The antibacterial properties of lysozyme were first noted
    by Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. Lysozyme
    is found in many body fluids such as tears, saliva or mucus
    to protect body surfaces from bacterial infections. Lysozyme
    is also found in high concentrations in egg white (to protect
    the developing chick).</p>
<p>Most bacteria have a cell wall composed of so-called cross-linked
    peptidoglycan, which gives a stable and difficult to transgress
    outer ‘skin’ to bacterial cells. This is illustrated in Figure
    1.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa/level3/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A bacterium, protected by its
        peptidoglycan cell wall. The zoom shows the fairly regular
        architecture of the cell wall, built from NAM (N-acetyl
        muramic acid) and NAG (N-acetyl glucosamine) sugar units.
        The bacterial cell wall is further strengthened by cross-linking
        peptides.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cell wall protects bacteria from taking up too much water
    and exploding. Lysozyme kills bacteria by attacking the cell
    wall, causing it to rupture and the bacterium to die. The
    mechanism of the attack is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa/level3/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Lysozyme binding to the bacterial
        cell wall; note the nearly perfect fit except at position
        D where the NAM unit is strained, creating a weakened
        link and a site where lysozyme can cut the sugar chain
        of the bacterial cell wall.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lysozyme is structured in such a way that its active site is
    able to wrap around and bind with six of the NAM and NAG
    sugar units of the cell wall, the peptidoglycan. Upon binding
    the fit is perfect but the NAM sugar site D in the bacterial
    cell wall (see Figure 2) is now strained, making it unstable
    and more reactive. This allows lysozyme to cut the bond between
    the sugar units in the D and E sites, breaking the peptidoglycan
    into fragments. Lysozyme then detaches from the site and
    finds another site to bind with and cut. In this way the
    bacterial cell wall is increasingly weakened as lysozyme
    makes more and more cuts in the cell wall.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa/level3/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Death of the bacterial cell by
        explosion, from inflow of water into the cell and corresponding
        increased intra-cell pressure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 3 symbolises the final result – once the cell wall is
    sufficiently weakened, it ruptures. Water then flows into
    the bacterial cell because the inside of the cell has a high
    concentration of solutes (dissolved ions and molecules),
    higher than the concentration in the surrounding tissue.
    Water continues to flow in until eventually the pressure
    inside the bacterial cell is such that the cell wall cannot
    hold the pressure and the bacterial cell literally explodes.</p>
<p>There are no indications that harmful bacteria are going to be
    able to develop any resistance to this natural antibiotic,
    lysozyme, any time soon: lysozyme attacks such a fundamental
    principle of the ‘anatomy’ and functioning of bacteria that
    they would have great difficulties to adapt their ways to
    escape from the fatal attack of lysozyme, without dying anyway.
    Unfortunately the same cannot be said about antibacterial
    agents invented by humans – these antibiotics are more prone
    to allow bacteria to learn how to circumvent their actions
    (that is, become resistant). This is now a widespread publically
    acknowledged problem.</p>
<p>It may thus appear an obvious solution to use lysozyme in the
    treatment of bacterial infections. If only it would be that
    simple! First of all, these kinds of proteins are highly
    likely to be specific to a particular species (for example,
    humans will have slightly different versions of them than
    other animals). Second, think of the very large lysozyme
    molecule – it is too large to be easily moved around through
    your digestive system, it cannot be easily delivered to a
    target site in the body by, for example, using it as a tablet;
    it has to be made by your body at the location where it is
    needed.</p>
<h3>Lactoferrin</h3>
<p>Lactoferrin is a moderately sized glycoprotein molecule (ca.
    80 kDa that is found in many body secretions such as human
    milk, nasal mucus, saliva or tears. It forms part of our
    body immune system and is known to have antibacterial, antifungal
    and antiviral properties. The various exact working mechanisms
    of these multiple actions of lactoferrin are not all known
    to the same degree of precision as the functioning of lysozyme.</p>
<p>However, several of the many roles and functions of lactoferrin
    are well characterised. Figure 4 illustrates one of the known
    mechanisms underlying the antibacterial function of lactoferrin.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa/level3/figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The two main domains of the lactoferrin
        molecule, binding Fe3+ ions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The two main domains in the lactoferrin molecular structure are
    ideally set up to accommodate Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, thus
    lactoferrin binding Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions from the surroundings
    makes these ions unavailable to bacteria, and most bacteria
    need these ions to promote their growth.</p>
<p>Another mechanism of the antibacterial properties of lactoferrin
    is shown in Figure 5.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa/level3/figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The cooperative antibacterial
        action of lactoferrin and lysozyme.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cell wall of bacteria is protected by a layer of, essentially,
    fat and sugar molecules (a so-called lipopolysaccharide layer),
    a little bit in the spirit of impregnating a rain coat. By
    binding to this protective layer, lactoferrin alters the
    layer’s permeability and eases the access to the structural
    part of the cell wall (the peptidoglycan layer) for the lysozyme
    molecules. Lactoferrin in this way enhances the antibacterial
    action of lysozyme.</p>

<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about these proteins'
        role in saliva with regard to eating, see our <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">detailed page about saliva and eating</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p><a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">Mucins</a>    are a family of typically very large molecules. Their main
    role is to give saliva its viscosity, making it sufficiently
    sticky to not be easily washed away and render it a non-Newtonian
    fluid (that is a fluid the viscosity of which depends on
    the shear forces acting on it).</p>
<p><a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">Statherin</a>    is an amphiphilic organic / biochemical molecule, a phospholipid
    with a polar hydrophilic end (hydrophilic means water loving)
    and a non-polar hydrophobic end (hydrophobic means water
    hating, sometimes equivalent with fat loving). The polar
    phosphate end of the molecule attaches itself to the surface
    (the enamel) of teeth where it helps to protect teeth and
    to yield a smooth surface of teeth in order to protect tongue
    and mucosa. This is sometimes termed a “biofilm”.</p>
<p><a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">Alpha-amylase</a>    is a large enzyme molecule. Its role as an enzyme is to enable
    the breaking down of large carbohydrate molecules in food
    (such as starch in potatoes) into smaller units while chewing
    and thus help eating. The related role of alpha-amylase in
    terms of oral health is to help clearing the mouth from debris
    after eating, including hard to reach spaces such as between
    teeth. Alpha-amylase is mostly contained in the on-demand
    saliva made in the <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">parotid gland while eating</a>.</p>
