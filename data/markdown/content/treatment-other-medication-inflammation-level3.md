<p>Having explored the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">normal working of the immune system</a>    and the resulting inflammatory responses in the context of
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a> and wound
    healing, there can be little doubt that a system as sophisticated
    as this body defence system will be error prone. Small deviations
    from perfect function may have major effects on many different
    body functions.</p>
<h1 id="malfunctions-of-the-immune-system">Malfunctions of the immune system</h1>
<p>Dysregulation of the immune system and the resulting malfunctioning
    inflammatory responses include an underactive immune system
    (hypoactive), an overactive immune system (hyperactive),
    or aberrant inflammatory responses of the immune system attacking
    the host’s own cells (autoimmune conditions) after misreading
    the self-cells as foreign / invaders. There is often considerable
    overlap between a hyperactive immune system and autoimmune
    conditions.</p>
<p>In a maxillofacial context, typically only a few such immune-system
    related conditions are encountered (see below). These conditions
    could either be genuine maxillofacial conditions, or other
    systemic conditions with signs and symptoms that will be
    addressed in a maxillofacial clinic.</p>
<p><strong>Hypoactive immune system</strong> conditions include</p>
<ul>
    <li>suppressed immune system after organ transplants (to prevent
        rejection of a transplant by the immune system of the
        host which would normally recognize and attack the presence
        of non-self cells; a suppressed immune system leads to
        generally increased <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>        risk)</li>
    <li>chronic and advanced renal (kidney) disease as well as the
        treatment of these conditions (dialysis) are associated
        with considerable dysregulation of the immune system
        (with a complicated simultaneous presence of up-regulated
        (chronic inflammation) and down-regulated subsections
        of the immune system; generally increased <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>        risk)</li>
    <li>long-term treated HIV infection leads to similar damage and
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a> risk
        from dysregulation of the immune system</li>
    <li>deficiency of a particular <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">antibody</a>,
        IgE, as revealed by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>        is associated with an increased risk for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">fungal infections</a>        such as by <i>candida albicans</i>; low (or absent) concentration
        of IgE in the blood may be caused by genetic disorders.
         </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hyperactive immune system</strong> conditions include</p>
<ul>
    <li>a wide range of (common) allergic reactions of varied severity
        and duration, caused by all kinds of normally harmless
        substances (allergens) in the environment (such as pollen,
        foods, certain metals and metal ions, or medications).
        There is a common underlying mechanism to all these different
        reactions, which can range from mild irritations to sometimes
        severe or life-threatening (anaphylactic shock) allergic
        reactions. IgE <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">antibodies</a>        bind to some surface receptor of the allergen, and thus
        initiate a misguided, sometimes violent, inflammatory
        response. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">Blood tests</a>        for allergies typically show elevated levels of IgE antibodies.
        Repeated and prolonged exposure to an allergen over time
        may enhance the severity of the inflammatory / allergic
        response because the immune system carries on learning
        and in some instances misunderstanding, about its roles
        and tasks.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed">orofacial granulomatosis</a>,
        prolonged and repeated swellings in the orofacial area,
        in particular the lips, is known to be an inflammatory
        process related to overreactions of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">T cells</a>        (subtype of white blood cells involved in the immune
        system), occasionally it is the symptom of an allergy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Autoimmune</strong> conditions include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">recurrent mouth ulcers</a>        , especially more severe cases</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">arthritis</a> affecting
        the jaw joint (a rare variant of arthritis which more
        commonly affects other joints)</li>
    <li>type 1 diabetes, where the underlying autoimmune reaction
        destroys the insulin-producing cells and permanently
        alters and dysregulates the immune system in general,
        leading to a generally increased risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a></li>
    <li>Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune condition which affects
        the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">salivary glands</a>        and causes problems with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth (xerostomia)</a>        and dry eyes</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris</a>        are autoimmune conditions which cause blistering of the
        skin and oral mucosa (lining of the mouth) and mainly
        affect the elderly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to its role in driving hyperactive immune system behaviour
    in general (see above), the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">antibody</a>    IgE is also known to contribute to misguided inflammatory
    responses in autoimmune reactions, for example targeting
    self-cells in joints in arthritis.</p>
<h1 id="medications-which-interfere-with-the-immune-system-responses">Medications which interfere with the immune system responses</h1>
<h2>Medications to down-regulate or block the immune system response</h2>
<p>There are three main categories of medications in this category:
    antihistamines, corticosteroids, and more recently anti-TNF
    biologics.</p>
<p><strong>Antihistamines</strong> in some ways counteract the effects
    of histamine and are mostly known for their role in treating
    allergies. Histamine is a small molecule (see Figure 1) with
    many different roles in the body’s metabolism.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The molecular structure of histamine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Histamine is involved, amongst further roles, in the inflammatory
    response and immune system regulation in general, it promotes
    the secretion of gastric acid, and in the brain, it acts
    as a neurotransmitter in the regulation of the sleep-wake
    cycle by maintaining the awake / alert state. It may be surprising
    that such a small molecule has so many different roles, but
    it is precisely because it is a small, slightly polar molecule
    that histamine can fulfill these many roles: it can be easily
    dispensed everywhere in the body, it can bind to many different
    receptors and structures, and it is easy to generate in the
    cell cycle as and when needed.</p>
<p>Histamine is synthesised in specialized white blood cells (basophils)
    and mast cells. Throughout the body these cells are particularly
    common in regions with potential need to respond to injury
    or infection: blood vessels, nose, mouth, generally all inner
    and outer body surfaces. In the brain and in the stomach
    other, non-mast cells generate histamine.</p>
<p>Histamine is released in response to an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">antigen</a>    by mast cells and basophils when the chain of events is triggered
    by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">IgE antibodies</a>    on these cell surfaces binding to an antigen / allergen.
    If the response is to an allergen, this is known as an allergic
    immune response. Histamine works in similar ways to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">cytokines</a>    in the inflammatory response by causing vasodilation (the
    cause of common itching and swelling in an allergic reaction).</p>
<p>Most antihistamines designed to reduce the effects and symptoms
    caused by histamine release do so by blocking the histamine
    receptors (called histamine-1; see below) so that the allergic
    reaction stops at that stage. This is schematically illustrated
    in Figure 2.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level3-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> An antihistamine blocking the
        histamine-1 receptor on the cell surface.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the histamine receptor site blocked, also the clinical signs
    and symptoms of an allergic reaction are blocked, or at least
    reduced. However, the mast cells and basophils continue to
    generate and release histamine as long as the allergen is
    not removed.</p>
<p>There is a large number of substances with antihistamine properties,
    interacting with and hindering the histamine-1 receptor sites.
    Acrivastine, diphenhydramine and doxylamine (see Figure 3)
    are long-established such antihistamines.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level3-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Molecular structures of three
        well-established antihistamines; top: acrivastine, middle:
        diphenhydramine, bottom: doxylamine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They all share a pattern of prominent unwanted effects, such
    as causing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>    and drowsiness. The mechanisms leading to drowsiness are
    readily explained: most antihistamines easily pass the blood-brain
    barrier. Since the role of histamine in the brain is to support
    alertness and prevent sleep to take over, blocking or hindering
    histamine action in the brain has the obvious consequence
    of leading to drowsiness and fatigue. In fact, some substances
    with antihistamine properties can be used as sedatives. Newer
    antihistamines are designed such that they should less easily
    cross the blood-brain barrier and thus cause less drowsiness.</p>
<p>A slightly different type of histamine receptor (called histamine-2)
    is found on the stomach cells responsible for secreting gastric
    acid and activated by histamine. For example, ranitidine,
    a well-known medication to treat indigestion (heartburn),
    is an antihistamine that blocks the histamine-2 receptor
    site and thus reduces the secretion of gastric acid. This
    can be exploited to either treat gastritis (inflammation
    of the lining of the stomach), or as a protective agent to
    prevent gastritis from developing as a consequence of long(er)
    term use of oral <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesia</a>    with NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); see below.</p>
<p><strong>Corticosteroids</strong> are hormones, naturally produced
    in the adrenal glands (a pair of small glands situated above
    the kidneys). Synthetic corticosteroids are modelled closely
    upon those occurring naturally. There are two types of corticosteroids:
    at their natural, very low concentration glucocorticoids
    predominantly have an effect on the metabolism of proteins
    and carbohydrates, whereas mineral corticosteroids regulate
    the balance of water and electrolytes (salts) in the body.
    Mineral corticosteroids can interfere with the production
    of histamine (see above) by white blood cells and so reduce
    the amount of histamine released in the allergic inflammatory
    response. Figure 4 shows the molecular structures of a few
    (of very many) selected corticosteroids.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level3-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> A selection of naturally occurring
        (top row) and synthetic (bottom row) corticosteroids.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cortisone, hydrocortisone and aldosterone are produced in the
    adrenal glands in very small quantities. Aldosterone mainly
    regulates electrolytes and water metabolism. Cortisone and
    hydrocortisone are glucocorticoids. The bottom part of Figure
    4 shows just two examples of very many synthetic corticosteroids,
    highlighting the close chemical similarity between natural
    and synthetic steroids.</p>
<p>At concentrations exceeding the natural very low levels, glucocorticoids
    have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties,
    as well as their impact on metabolism. The anti-inflammatory
    properties of glucocorticoids were discovered in the 1940s.
    Figure 5 schematically illustrates the mechanism of action
    of glucocorticoids.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level3-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Glucocorticoids prevent the destabilization
        and disintegration of lysosome and cellular membranes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the cellular level as part of their anti-inflammatory properties,
    glucocorticoids stabilise the membranes of lysosomes. This
    prevents the release of aggressive hydrolytic enzymes into
    the cytoplasm of the cell and ensures continued normal function
    of the cell. In addition, glucocorticoids also stabilise
    the outer membranes of the various types of white blood cells,
    preventing rupture of cells. Glucocorticoids regulate the
    permeability of capillaries so that an overactive immune
    response is curbed because white blood cells remain contained
    in the blood vessels. Glucocorticoids further prevent phagocytes
    and leukocytes (types of white blood cells which kill and
    digest pathogens) from accumulating. By inhibiting phagocytosis
    (the engulfment of pathogens) as well as decreasing the amount
    of antibody formation (in response to the presence of a pathogen)
    the immune response is reduced.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids are mainly used as anti-inflammatory agents,
    often in the treatment of autoimmune conditions, but are
    also used as immunosuppressants (for example to prevent organ
    rejection after organ transplants). They can be <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">administered</a>    in many different ways, topically, orally or intravenously.</p>
<p>The active, mainly short-term use of a small range of corticosteroids
    (such as hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone;
    see Figure 4) in maxillofacial surgery is to suppress swelling
    after elective surgery, sometimes in severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    where swelling around the airway may be an issue (although
    some corticosteroids can reduce the effectiveness of some
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial agents</a>    ) and sometimes for a putative improvement of microvascular
    flow.</p>
<p>The long-term use of corticosteroids (as prescribed for a range
    of conditions outside a maxillofacial clinic, for example
    severe allergic reactions, rheumatoid arthritis, colitis,
    asthma, lupus, psoriasis) is more of an issue and requires
    careful consideration of benefits and risks as these medications
    have many unwanted effects, including serious side effects.
    The list of unwanted effects includes hypertension (high
    blood pressure), oedema (fluid retention), muscle weakness,
    osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalances, weight gain and fat
    deposits, thinning of the skin and slow wound healing, increased
    risk of infections. When people are on long-term medication
    with corticosteroids for some non-maxillofacial related condition(s),
    this can still have impact on a range of considerations in
    maxillofacial surgery, from fitness for surgery, to risk
    assessment for increased risk of infection from immunosuppression,
    to the general effects of steroids on metabolism (including
    slow wound healing), This is the case because corticosteroids
    overall suppress the the hypothalamopituitary axis. This
    axis includes the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the
    adrenal glands, which together form one of the four main
    regulatory metabolic and endocrine regulation systems in
    the body.  </p>
<p><strong>NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)</strong>    have both anti-inflammatory and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">pain-relieving</a>    properties, with the latter being their main effect and the
    former a welcome added bonus. Well-known (over the counter)
    analgesics such as ibuprofen, diclofenac or aspirin belong
    to this category of widely used pain-control medications.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about pain-relieving medications,
        this information is on our pages about <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesics</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Nearly 50 years ago, a protein with signaling properties to initiate
    tumour <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">necrosis</a>    was discovered and named tumour necrosis factor, TNF. Soon
    TNF was known to be involved in multiple regulatory cell
    cycles, in particular it is now known to be the master of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">pro-inflammatory cytokines</a>.
    This inflammation-promoting role of TNF is also critical
    in autoimmune inflammatory conditions. Unsurprisingly, research
    was soon devoted to block this biological role of TNF for
    the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory conditions such
    as rheumatoid arthritis. Such biological agents were termed
    <strong>anti-TNF biologics</strong>, and five such substances
    were licensed for treatment of inflammatory conditions in
    2017 (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab and certolizumab
    pegol), with more candidates in various stages of development,
    from laboratory phase to pre-clinical and clinical studies.</p>
<p>The strong anti-inflammatory effects of blocking TNF by adalimumab
    and similar agents are undoubtedly wonderful for some people
    afflicted by painful inflammatory conditions which can be
    very effectively treated with these agents. However, only
    half of people with such conditions respond to treatment
    with anti-TNF agents. In addition, anti-TNF agents are a
    double-edged sword in that their clinical effectiveness in
    reducing the inflammatory response is closely coupled with
    their powerful immunosuppressant properties (given the multiple
    cell regulatory roles of TNF), leading to a number of potentially
    serious adverse effects. Such unwanted effects include a
    much-increased risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    as well as increased risks of development and/or recurrence
    of malignancies.</p>
<p>The exact role and mechanisms of TNF and anti-TNF agents warrant
    much more research. For example, anti-TNF therapy leads to
    worsening in almost all cases of multiple sclerosis, and
    anti-TNF therapy can trigger new autoimmune conditions (for
    example, psoriasis). <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/immunotherapies">Immunotherapies</a>    in general, in the treatment of malignancies as well as of
    inflammatory conditions require a far better understanding
    of their fundamental biology.</p>
<h2>Medications to up-regulate the immune system response</h2>
<p>Such medications are not really used for, or particularly relevant
    to maxillofacial conditions specifically.</p>
<p>As a matter of completeness, we just mention briefly that in
    general, however, there are roles for such medications. In
    particular the treatment and prevention of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">viral infections</a>    such as HIV or variants of hepatitis, may make a boost to
    the body’s immune response desirable. There is a wide range
    of such biological immunostimulant agents (interferons) available
    for therapeutic use. Another immunostimulant can be histamine
    (see above) which is used for this purpose in the form of
    histamine dihydrochloride.</p>
