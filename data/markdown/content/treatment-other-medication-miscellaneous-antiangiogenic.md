<p>Angiogenesis is the growth of blood vessels. Antiangiogenic medications
    (also called angiogenesis inhibitors) are a group of substances
    which hinder the blood-vessel growth process in various different
    ways. When first discussed as a means to ‘starve’ malignant
    tumours by cutting off, or reducing tumour blood supply,
    some 50 years ago this was hailed as the new and bright era
    of cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Since then antiangiogenic medications have had a long and controversial
    history. An infamous example of a drug with antiangiogenic
    properties is thalidomide (which was responsible for foetal
    developmental defects because the antiangiogenic properties
    of the drug prevented the normal formation and growth of
    limbs in a foetus when given to pregnant women).</p>
<p>Antiangiogenic substances (of which there are many) work by blocking
    one, or several of the, proteins that initiate and carry
    through vascular growth. The medications are used topically
    (injected into the eye) for the treatment of the age-related
    eye-disease macula degeneration, and systemically in the
    treatment of several advanced malignancies (including colon,
    kidney, liver, thyroid and lung cancers, as well as some
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">haematological malignancies</a>).
    The most commonly used substances with antiangiogenic properties
    are</p>
<ul>
    <li>bevacizumab (blocks a specific growth factor protein needed
        for endothelial (lining) growth of blood vessels, VEGF-A,
        that is particularly active in the angiogenesis of tumour
        tissues);</li>
    <li>sunitinib (blocks cellular messaging pathways for a number
        of growth factors, including some related to platelets
        and VEGF-A);</li>
    <li>sorafenib (blocks similar cellular mechanisms as sunitinib
        plus some specific kinase proteins).</li>
</ul>
<p>The wanted beneficial effects of antiangiogenics on curbing tumour
    growth are very closely coupled with the clinical risks of
    their unwanted toxicities, typically with a very narrow
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">therapeutic window</a>. These unwanted effects can be serious
        and include severe bleeding, hypertension (high blood
        pressure), other cardiac risks (such as ischaemia (lack
        of blood supply) of the heart muscle).</p>
<p>In some instances, very good tumour control or even shrinkage
    achieved by angiogenesis inhibitors (usually in combination
    with other <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    substances) have been reported. However, there are also reports
    with evidence that in some circumstances the enforced hypoxia
    (starving of oxygen) of tumour tissue may actually encourage
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastasis</a>,
    the spread of regional and distant malignancy. At least for
    the time being, the long and controversial history of antiangiogenics
    is bound to continue.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that antiangiogenic medications will be prescribed
    in a maxillofacial clinic. However, some of the unwanted
    effects of these drugs may need consultation and treatment
    in a maxillofacial clinic.</p>
