<p>Below we discuss in a little more detail the background
    to some commonly performed procedures in purely
    aesthetic facial surgery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>rhytidectomy (face lift, of which there are many
        different varieties)</li>
    <li>blepharoplasty (addressing puffy or sagging upper
        and/or lower eyelids, related: brow lift)</li>
    <li>otoplasty (improving the appearance of prominent
        ears (‘bat ears’))</li>
    <li>rhinoplasty (a range of corrections to the nose)
    </li>
    <li>genioplasty (movement or reshaping of the chin)</li>
    <li>miscellaneous procedures.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rhytidectomy">Rhytidectomy</h1>
<p>Rhytidectomy, or facelift, addresses the sagging skin and
    wrinkles of ageing. The elasticity of skin diminishes
    with age as collagen weakens. Collagen is the main
    stabilising and structure providing protein component in
    tissues such as tendons or skin. A facelift does not
    restore the collagen production in an ageing body to
    that of a young body but it can make the visible effects
    of weakening collagen less visible, at least
    temporarily.</p>
<p>The areas of the face addressed by rhytidectomy are
    essentially the lateral (side) face and neck (jowl),
    bilaterally extending to the cervical (neck) midline.
    Cervicofacial (neck &amp; face) rhytidectomy is
    considered one operation, but it can be separated into
    its neck and face components. A facelift is often a
    two-part procedure:</p>
<ul>
    <li>one for the lower face and jowls,</li>
    <li>one for the midface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The upper face, less commonly discussed, also needs to be
    addressed.</p>
<p>A stable successful rhytidectomy should be directed
    towards deeper connective tissue layers as well as skin.
    A skin-only facelift may relapse in as short a time as
    six months.</p>
<p>There are probably more <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">variations
        on the ‘facelift’</a> than on any other single
    procedure with a principal single outcome. The operation
    ranges from endoscopic through minimally invasive, mini
    to deep plane and subperiosteal (situated under the
    periosteum, the connective tissue enveloping bones)
    lifts. The most common tried and tested approaches are
    the classical skin-only lift (‘mini facelift’, which
    does not address the temporal (temple) region or the
    platysma (broad sheet of muscle stretching from the
    collarbone to beneath the jaws)) and the SMAS lift.</p>
<p>The superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS) is a
    subcutaneous (under the skin) tissue. Its sagging and
    ageing causes the skin to sag and slacken as well. A
    SMAS lift addresses the lower part of the face and aims
    to reduce the visible effects of sagging in the midface,
    loose skin and fat (under the chin and jaws), hollow
    cheeks. A SMAS lift greatly reduces relapse by providing
    a robust component that can be fixed in a less temporary
    fashion than a skin-only facelift. A large area
    addressed by rhytidectomy is the neck, and platysmal
    plication (tucking and tightening of the platysma
    muscle) may be performed at the same time.</p>
<h1 id="blepharoplasty">Blepharoplasty</h1>
<p>Puffy or sagging eyelids are common complaints. Accurate
    diagnosis is essential. The complaint of sagging upper
    eyelids is often due to sagging of the eyebrows as
    opposed to excess tissue in the upper lid. In this
    situation the treatment is a brow lift first (see below)
    and then possibly an upper blepharoplasty. In assessing
    the lids, the appearance of bagginess may be due to skin
    or fat or both. The word blepharoplasty was first used
    by Karl Ferdinand von Gräfe (a surgeon from Warsaw,
    pioneering plastic and reconstructive surgery) in 1818
    to describe a procedure for repairing defects in the
    eyelids secondary to tumour excision.</p>
<p>The eyelids are one of the first structures of the face
    to develop structural changes due to ageing. Ageing
    results in changes in elasticity of the orbital septum,
    the tarsus and the orbicularis muscle. Clinically the
    loss of elasticity of these components of/near the
    eyelid leads to excess skin, wrinkles, pseudo-herniation
    of orbital fat, baggy and tired looking eyes. Changes in
    the skin are further characterised by development of
    pigmentary anomalies. Because skin quality is not
    altered by blepharoplasty, adjunctive therapies such as
    dermabrasion, chemical peeling or laser skin resurfacing
    may need to be incorporated into rejuvenation strategies
    (see below). Blepharoplasty will not on its own treat
    malar bags (swollen pads between lower eyelids and upper
    cheek) or the tear trough deformity (deep hollow under
    the eyes).</p>
<h2><strong>Lower lid blepharoplasty</strong></h2>
<p>The formation of bags under the eyes has more to do with
    problems with periorbital (around the eye) fat than
    skin. If fat requires removal this should be minimal and
    is achieved as much by <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy</a>
    to make it shrink as by excision. Excessive fat removal
    can lead to a sunken appearance, which is difficult to
    correct. Skin removal should be minimal.</p>
<h2><strong>Upper lid blepharoplasty</strong></h2>
<p>In contrast to the lower lids, upper lid bagginess is
    largely due to excess skin (although see brow lift
    below). An assessment as to the amount to remove may be
    made by pinching the skin of the lid until the eye
    starts to open. This is the minimum that should be
    removed. In addition to skin removal a small amount of
    muscle may need to be removed. As with the lower lids
    there may be a small amount of fat herniation which may
    require reduction but there is no lateral fat pad (this
    is the lacrimal gland and it should be left well alone).
</p>
<h1 id="brow-lift">Brow lift</h1>
<p>The eyebrows may become ptotic (drooping) with age
    resulting in lateral crow’s feet and hooding with
    concomitant overactivity of the forehead musculature
    with rhytid (wrinkle) formation. The brow lift aims to
    address this. There are several <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">brow
        lift techniques</a> the choice of which is
    determined, largely, by the height of the forehead. The
    distance between the upper edge of the eyebrows and the
    hairline should be approximately 5 cm. This may be
    lengthened or shortened by a particular brow lift, and
    this should be borne in mind when planning.</p>
<h1 id="otoplasty-pinnaplasty">Otoplasty (pinnaplasty)</h1>
<p>The arterial blood supply of the ear arises from the
    superficial temporal and the posterior auricular
    arteries. Its sensory supply is from the
    auriculotemporal, great auricular and vagus nerves. The
    auricle (the visible part of the outer ear, also
    referred to as pinna) is fully formed at birth. It
    reaches 85 % of its final size by the age of three and
    is virtually adult size by six years.</p>
<p>Bat ears can be a source of misery for children due to
    teasing at school.</p>
<p>They are characterised by an excessive angle between the
    pinna and the skull, congenital absence of an antihelix
    (part of the pinna, a stretch of cartilage) or a
    combination of both. Again proper evaluation of the
    exact problem is required. The problem may be caused by
    the pinna with an absence of an antihelix, or the
    conchal bowl (bowl-shaped inner part of the outer ear)
    creating an excessive concho-occipital angle (angle with
    the lower back part of the skull).</p>
<p>There is a variety of <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">surgical
        techniques</a> to address problems with prominent
    ears.</p>
<h1 id="rhinoplasty">Rhinoplasty</h1>
<p>Rhinoplasty is one of the most demanding techniques in
    aesthetic surgery. As with all of the topics discussed
    in this section, evaluation of the problem is critical.
    The nose consists of skin, fibro-fatty connective
    tissue, hyaline cartilage and bone. As a rule,
    rhinoplasty can address problems related to cartilage
    and bone but it cannot alter the skin of the nose, which
    can vary from paper thin to thick and fleshy with many
    sebaceous glands.</p>
<p>The nose should be assessed with a view to maintaining
    the aesthetic balance and characteristics of the face.
    For example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-disproportion">mandibular
        retrognathism</a> (a too small lower jaw) may make a
    perfectly acceptable nose appear large, but this will be
    in proportion following a <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">mandibular
        advancement procedure</a>.</p>
<p>The nose should be examined from all angles including
    above and below. The various components to assess are
    tip projection, supra tip break, dorsal hump, nostril
    symmetry, septal deviation and skin quality.</p>
<p>There are vast arrays of incisions that may be used in <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">performing
        a rhinoplasty</a>; however, there are essentially
    two approaches, open or closed. The closed approach
    remains the most popular and involves intranasal
    incisions. An open rhinoplasty will leave a small scar
    across the columella (tissue that separates the
    nostrils), a closed rhinoplasty will not.</p>
<p>If the nasal tip needs to be addressed this can mean</p>
<ul>
    <li>increasing of the tip projection,</li>
    <li>decreasing of the tip projection,</li>
    <li>increasing of the tip rotation,</li>
    <li>decreasing of the tip rotation.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="genioplasty-movement-or-reshaping-of-the-chin">Genioplasty (movement or reshaping of the chin)</h1>
<p>Genioplasty is movement of, or reshaping, of the chin.
    There are a number of approaches to this operation,
    usually depending on the training of the surgeon.
    Conventional genioplasty is an <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic
        procedure</a>. Genioplasty may aim to reduce or
    augment the bulk of the chin, or to correct asymmetries.
</p>
<p>Variations on the <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">advancement
        genioplasty</a> have become popular in the treatment
    of obstructive sleep apnoea. The concept has an evidence
    base and relies on the advancement of the genial
    attachments of the tongue musculature.</p>
<p>Augmentation genioplasty by implants is used by some
    surgeons. This may involve synthetic materials as
    implants (silicone elastomers, coral (as a substitute
    for a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">bone
        graft</a>) and other synthetic materials) or the
    patient’s own bone. Almost inevitably, the aesthetic
    result using the patient’s own bone is superior to that
    using synthetic materials.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-procedures-and-conditions">Miscellaneous procedures and conditions</h1>
<p><a href="/treatment-other-misc-peeling"><strong>Facial
            rejuvenation</strong></a> destroys the very
    superficial layer of the skin (‘chemical peeling’;
    different chemical agents will affect the skin to
    different depths). This can be carried out using
    chemicals such as glycolic acid, trichloroacetic acid or
    phenol. A similar effect can be achieved with a <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">CO<sub>2</sub>
        laser</a>. After healing the finer rhytids
    (wrinkles) will have disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>Dermabrasion</strong> works in much the same way
    as the rejuvenation procedures but uses a large bur to
    smooth rough areas of skin or scarring. It is
    particularly useful for severe skin damage such as the
    results of bad acne.</p>
<p><strong>Fillers</strong> such as <a href="/treatment-other-medication-misc-collagen">collagen</a>
    and <a href="/treatment-other-medication-misc-hyaluronidase">hyaluronidase</a>
    solutions, sometimes combined with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">local
        analgesia</a> are used to fill out subcutaneous
    hollows, either deep such as the nasolabial folds
    (‘smile lines’), or tiny such as labial rhytids
    (multiple small wrinkles around the lips). Sometimes a
    temporary solution to traumatic or acne scarring.</p>
<p><strong>Rhinophyma</strong> is a condition caused by an
    overgrowth of sebaceous glands in the nasal skin (see
    Figure 1). The perception that it is due to excessive
    alcohol intake is erroneous. It can be quite dramatic in
    appearance but is relatively easily treated. The tissue
    can either be excised or dermabraded (see above).
    Mechanical removal may be used in conjunction with a <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">CO<sub>2</sub>
        laser</a>. The tissue should be sent for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histology</a>
    as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">basal
        cell carcinoma</a> may mimic benign rhinophyma.</p>

<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/botulinum"><strong>Botulinum
            alpha toxin</strong></a> prevents acetylcholine
    release at the neuromuscular junction, paralysing the
    muscle. Its use is widespread, particularly for the
    treatment of rhytids. Rhytids are formed at right angles
    to the direction of pull of the underlying musculature.
    Paralysis of these muscles with botulinum toxin
    decreases the wrinkling present and can prevent future
    rhytid formation.</p>
<p>The botulinum alpha toxin solution is injected into the
    muscles in the affected area, most commonly the
    forehead, the glabella, and the crow’s feet. In the
    forehead, the injection should be at least 1 cm above
    the eyebrow to prevent unwanted ptosis (sagging of the
    eyebrow). The injection sites should not be massaged as
    this makes the solution dissipate unpredictably. The
    patients (or clients) should remain upright for 4 hours
    and not undertake strenuous exercise that day.
    Otherwise, it is a remarkably safe procedure. The effect
    can be variable but will usually last six months to a
    year. Repeated injections over time may have a more
    permanent effect. Paralysis of facial muscles is a
    potential unwanted effect.</p>
<p>Botulinum alpha toxin also is useful in treating
    bleopharospasm (involuntary twitching or contraction of
    the eyelid, masseteric hypertrophy (enlargement of the
    masseter (cheek) muscle; see Figure 2), temporalis
    hypertrophy (painful enlargement of the temporalis
    (chewing) muscle leading to soft tissue swelling of the
    temple; see Figure 3) and Frey’s syndrome (redness and
    sweating on the cheek in conjunction with eating /
    salivation; usually an unwanted effect of surgery of or
    near the parotid gland).</p>
