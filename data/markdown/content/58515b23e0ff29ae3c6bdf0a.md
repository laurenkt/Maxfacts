<p>At its most basic if a bone is broken but not pushed out of place
    by the force of the injury (undisplaced) it will heal as
    long as it is left undisturbed and force is not put on it.
    This is the basis of splinting. If it is displaced then it
    must be put back into the correct position and kept there
    undisturbed for however long it takes to heal. If it is exposed
    to the outside world it is at risk of becoming infected and
    should be returned to normal as soon as possible. If it is
    multiple pieces the same process has to be followed for healing
    to happen but it might be very much more complicated.</p>
<p>In the face and skull most bones will heal in around 3 weeks.
    That means if the bones are not returned to their correct
    position within that time they will heal and get stuck in
    the abnormal position. That is called a malunion. To avoid
    malunion, reduction and fixation are necessary, which may
    be open or closed (i.e. cuts are made in the mouth or on
    the skin to get to the fractures and return them to the previous
    correct position; “reduction” can be done under direct vision
    or by feel). Using endoscopes counts as a minimal access
    open reduction. Fixation may be direct with plates and screws
    (very common), wires (now rare) or indirect fixation (by
    wiring teeth together in the position that is normal for
    you. Figure 1 summarizes the procedure: Figure 1, top left,
    shows a mandible before injury; Figure 1, top right, shows
    the fractures and misaligned mandible; Figure 1, bottom left,
    shows the broken mandible after reduction; Figure 1, bottom
    right, shows the broken and re-aligned mandible after fixation
    (with plates and screws). This treatment is usually performed
    under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>.</p>
