<p>With malignancies affecting the <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/blood-malignancy">blood</a>    or <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/other">lymph systems</a>    or <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/other">nerve tissues</a>    as well as malignancies in the head and neck region that
    occur as <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/metastases">secondary tumours (metastases)</a>    from tumours elsewhere in the body all being very different
    conditions, the timelines and outcomes are different. Treatments
    of <a href="/treatment/timelines/tumour/blood-malignancy">blood malignancies</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/timelines/tumour/metastases">secondary tumours (metastases)</a>,
    malignancies affecting the <a href="/treatment/timelines/tumour/other">lymph system</a>    and malignancies of <a href="/treatment/timelines/tumour/other">nerve tissues</a>    also differ.</p>
<p>Timelines of treatment and outcomes for more common malignancies
    of the head and neck region are described elsewhere on the
    website (<a href="/treatment/timelines/cancer/mouth-cancer">mouth (oral) cancer</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/timelines/cancer/facial-skin-cancer">facial skin cancer</a>    and <a href="/treatment/timelines/cancer/salivary-gland-cancer">cancer of the salivary glands</a>).
    In addition, a separate section deals with the timelines
    of treatment and outcomes for <a href="/treatment/timelines/bone-lesion">malignant bone lesions</a>.</p>
