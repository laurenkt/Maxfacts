<p>Treatment of postoperative problems affecting the foot include</p>
<ul>
    <li>The consequences of surgery on the <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/lower-leg">lower leg</a>        overlap, so similar considerations apply.</li>
    <li>Indirect issues are:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">altered sensation</a>                over the lateral foot (side of the foot) from
                use of the sural nerve (sensory nerve in the
                calf of the leg) as a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive nerve graft</a>,
                or if injured during preparation of lower leg
                skin in flaps or grafts;</li>
            <li>inability to elevate the big toe, secondary to dysfunction
                of muscles dissected when raising a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">free fibula microvascular flap</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
