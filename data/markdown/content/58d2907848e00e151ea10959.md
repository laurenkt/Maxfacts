<p>We want to encourage you to make the most of these gentle physiotherapy
    exercises. Do them often (minimum of two to three times a
    day) and don’t give up (none of the exercises should cause
    pain, just mild discomfort from re-activation). We want to
    see you back in control as soon and as well as possible.
    Some of the exercises may not be possible straight after
    surgery, while others are specifically intended to help immediate
    mobilisation. Some exercises are meant for ‘continued use’,
    and some are preventative in nature.</p>
