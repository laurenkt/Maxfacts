<p>Postoperative problems affecting the shoulder include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduced mobility. <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">Neck dissections</a>        of all types interfere to a greater or lesser extent
        with the spinal accessory nerve. This nerve provides
        part of the motor innervation to the trapezius muscle,
        which plays a very important role in shoulder stabilisation
        and mobility.</li>
    <li>Stiffness and discomfort can result from a lack of mobility.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Pain</a> may be
        caused by muscle spasm or impingement of the muscles,
        tendons and bone of the shoulder as a result of trapezius
        muscle dysfunction.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>.
        Although this is mostly something that is noticed in
        the skin of the neck, any damage to the lower part of
        the cervical plexus of nerves (a group of nerves with
        a range of functionalities, arranged along the spinal
        cord in the neck; particularly cervical nerve C5) will
        create a lack of or altered sensation over the deltoid
        muscle (the muscle that forms the very top of the arm
        and thus the rounded corner of the shoulder, the so-called
        epaulette region (where soldiers have a patch on their
        upper arm)).</li>
