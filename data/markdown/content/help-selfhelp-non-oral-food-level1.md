<p>Even with the best will and effort it may not always be
    possible to avoid short or extended periods of time
    during and/or after maxillofacial treatment when taking
    food and/or drink by mouth becomes quite impossible, or
    difficult enough so that insufficient <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">nutrition or
        hydration</a> would result without further
    intervention. For a few people non-oral food intake will
    become a permanent fixture, either as the sole source of
    nutrition or to supplement insufficient food intake by
    mouth.</p>
<p>Situations where non-oral feeding may become necessary,
    typically arise after major <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">maxillofacial
        surgery and reconstruction</a>, including severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage/detailed">facial
        trauma</a> after accidents, because of the adverse
    effects of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>
    applied to the head and neck region (especially <a href="/treatment/surgery/oral-mucosal-lesions/detailed">mucositis</a>),
    serious <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">infections</a>,
    or efforts to avoid oral infections after oral surgery.
</p>
<p>Principally non-oral feeding approaches include</p>
<ul>
    <li>parenteral feeding (feeding by an intravenous drip,
        extremely rare in maxillofacial surgery);</li>
    <li>enteral feeding (for maxillofacial conditions,
        typically <i>via</i> a feeding tube inserted into
        the stomach, either inserted<ul>
            <li>through the nose and oesophagus into the
                stomach (a naso-gastric (NG) feeding tube);
                or</li>
            <li>through the wall of the abdomen directly
                into the stomach (a percutaneous endoscopic
                gastrostomy (PEG).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Parenteral feeding is much more rarely used in
    maxillofacial surgery than in general surgery, as for
    maxillofacial conditions gut function is relatively
    rarely disrupted below stomach level. Generally,
    parenteral feeding is the fall-back feeding option
    and/or last resort if for some reason(s) enteral feeding
    is not possible. It is not the first non-oral feeding
    choice because parenteral feeding carries more risks
    than enteral tube feeding and is less suitable for
    long(er) term feeding outside a hospital setting because
    it essentially requires round-the-clock, slow drip
    operation.</p>
<p>Here we concentrate on enteral tube feeding. The
    following pages describe enteral feeding in more detail,
    both NG and PEG tube feeding. In the majority of cases
    tube feeding is a short- or medium-term intervention to
    help somebody through a period of difficulty, and oral
    food intake returns to some level of normality over
    time. We also briefly discuss practical aspects
    concerning long-term tube feeding and how to manage best
    at home.</p>
