<p>Procedures referred to as ‘facial rejuvenation’,
    ‘chemical peeling’, facial resurfacing’, or <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance/detailed">‘non-surgical
        facelift’</a> destroy the very superficial layers of
    the skin. After healing finer rhytids (wrinkles), scars
    and pigmented spots will be much reduced or disappear,
    thus resulting in an improved appearance of facial skin.
    Accordingly, the most common reasons to perform such
    procedures are aged skin (chronic photo-ageing),
    hyperpigmentation and scarring from severe acne. Facial
    resurfacing has also been reported as a means to improve
    the aesthetic appearance of facial <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin grafts
        and free flaps</a>.</p>
<p>Chemical agents used in these procedures (‘chemical
    peeling’) essentially dissolve and remove damaged skin
    and initiate wound healing which, in turn, leads to skin
    rejuvenation. The effect is achieved because these
    chemical exfoliating agents cause denaturation of
    proteins in the epidermis (the outer layer of skin) and
    dermis (the layer underneath the epidermis). This
    triggers inflammation and induces the healing process.

<p>Different chemical agents (Figure 1) affect the skin to
    different depths.</p>

        phenol (middle), trichloroacetic acid (bottom).

</figure>
<p>These agents are usually classified according to the
    depth of lesion they cause. The usual categories are
    superficial, medium-depth and deep peels. The effect
    depends not only on the type of chemical, but also on
    its concentration, duration of application, repeat
    patterns of treatments, and individual skin type.</p>
<p><strong>Superficial peels</strong> only affect the
    epidermis. Glycolic acid (Figure 1 top) and several
    similar chemicals agents in dilute preparations are
    typical for these applications. As only the epidermis is
    affected, superficial peels have no effect on wrinkles.
</p>
<p><strong>Medium-depth peels</strong> penetrate the
    epidermis and parts of the dermis; trichloroacetic acid
    (Figure 1 bottom) is an example of a chemical agent used
    to achieve medium-depth peeling. Trichloroacetic acid is
    used to treat fine rhytids, hyperpigmentation, and
    occasionally UV-radiation (photodamage) related,
    premalignant skin lesions such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia/more-info">actinic
        keratosis</a>. Application of higher concentrations
    of trichloroacetic acid carries a significant risk of
    adverse effects, including scarring, alteration of skin
    colour, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">bacterial
        superinfections and reactivation of herpes simplex
        infection</a>. Medium-depth peels are painful during
    and after the procedure and typically require <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">pain
        control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents
        (NSAIDS)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Deep peels</strong> reach all levels of the
    epidermis and dermis, and sometimes accidentally even
    deeper tissue layers. Deep peels can address more severe
    rhytids, photo- and age-related damage, and
    hyperpigmentation. The classic agent to perform chemical
    medium-depth to deep peels was phenol (Figure 1 middle),
    later typically used in preparations containing phenol,
    water, a detergent and croton oil (where it was
    eventually shown that the active peeling agent in this
    preparation is the croton oil, a poisonous substance
    isolated from a plant belonging to the <i>euphorbia</i>
    family). Phenol is a toxic substance and is to some
    extent systemically absorbed during treatment exposure.
    Phenol has adverse effects on the cardiac system and is
    toxic to liver and kidneys. Deep peels are painful
    during and after the intervention and require more
    potent <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesia</a>.
    After treatment, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">severe
        inflammation</a> and facial swelling is likely to
    occur; initial recovery is likely to take at least two
    to three weeks. In addition to the systemic toxicity of
    phenol, there are significant risks associated with deep
    peels, similar to medium-depth peels. Infection risks
    seem to be associated with the depth of a peel
    intervention.</p>
<p>With these adverse effects in mind, it is not surprising
    that chemical deep peels have become less popular
    recently. A variety of <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">lasers</a>
    are widely available and can be used for controlled and
    precise ablation of skin layers by vaporisation, without
    systemic toxicities.</p>
<p>Similarly, mechanical dermabrasion techniques are
    commonly used to treat severe acne scarring and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-appearance/more-info">rhinophyma</a>.
