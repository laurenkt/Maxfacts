<p>Damage to soft tissues of the mouth, jaws, face, scalp and neck
    is usually caused by injuries from accidents, although some
    wounds can be self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Depending on the cause of trauma, only minor damage may result
    or a serious, potentially life threatening emergency situation
    – and anything in between. Soft tissue damage may occur in
    combination with underlying damage to hard tissue (bone fractures).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read about hard tissue maxillofacial trauma,
        the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">assessment</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">treatment</a>        of fractures are described in our sections about broken
        bones.</p>
</aside>
<p>In an emergency situation, it is international best practice
    to follow standardised principles of trauma care (Advanced
    Trauma Life Support, ATLS). This system follows a logical
    sequence of care which is designed to maximise the efficiency
    of assessment of a trauma victim, as well as provide priority
    ranking of potential, life threatening problems and simultaneous
    resuscitative interventions.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read about the <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">ATLS system</a>,
        we describe it in our section about the treatment of
        fractures.</p>
</aside>
<p>Soft tissue injuries may be divided into several types, these
    types being roughly indicative of the mechanism of injury.
    There may be some overlap between types of soft tissue injury
    or they may be found in combination. Wounds may be categorised
    as</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abrasions (caused by the force of an object rubbing on the
        surface of the skin)</li>
    <li>Contusions (bruises due to rupture of blood vessels under
        the skin)</li>
    <li>Lacerations (splits in skin and underlying tissues due to
        blunt impact / force)</li>
    <li>Incised wounds (caused by incisions through skin and tissues
        with a sharp object)</li>
    <li>Avulsion (tissue displaced, partially or completely, at the
        wound site from underlying tissue)</li>
    <li>Haematoma (a collection of blood within the soft tissues)</li>
    <li>High velocity missile (caused by a high velocity object,
        such as a bullet or shrapnel)</li>
    <li>Burns (caused by a hot object or open flame).</li>
</ul>
<p>We include burns in the list of types of soft-tissue wounds as
    a matter of completeness but note that burn wounds are typically
    assessed and treated by specialist burns units.</p>
