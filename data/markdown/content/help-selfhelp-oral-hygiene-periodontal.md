<p>Periodontal disease (gum disease) is a chronic inflammatory condition
    that is bacterial in origin and affects the tissues that
    support and hold the teeth in place. It is very common, “the
    6<sup>th</sup> most preventable disease of mankind”.</p>
<p>During the early stages it is generally symptom free, but as
    it progresses tenderness in the gums and a tendency for the
    gums to bleed when brushing the teeth may develop. As the
    condition worsens the gums become progressively inflamed.
    Bad breath (halitosis) can become a problem and the gums
    recede, denoting underlying loss of the supporting bone resulting
    in the teeth becoming mobile. This pathway ends in loss of
    some or all of the teeth.</p>
<p>Periodontal disease can be compounded by a number of risk factors
    such as poor oral hygiene, smoking, diabetes, hereditary
    factors, stress and poor nutrition, immunosuppression. Furthermore,
    life-long control of periodontal disease, as much as possible
    is a vital part of avoiding tooth extractions after <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/application">radiotherapy</a>    in the head and neck region.</p>
<p>Daily every day home care is of primary importance and can go
    a very long way to improve oral health and control periodontal
    disease. This involves effective brushing twice daily  and
    some form of interdental cleaning daily. Where bone loss
    is involved the damage cannot easily be repaired but the
    condition can often be stabilised to prevent further damage.</p>

        oral hygiene home care for oneself, for a wide range
        of circumstances</p>
