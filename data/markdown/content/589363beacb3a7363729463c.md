<p>The basis of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment are the relationships
    for inert gases between pressure and volume, and pressure
    and dissolution in a liquid: i) the pressure of an inert
    gas is inversely proportional to its volume (Boyle’s law;
    named after R.W. Boyle, 1627-1691); ii) the amount of dissolved
    inert gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial
    pressure of the gas in contact with the liquid (Henry’s law;
    W. Henry, 1803). Henry’s law is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

        dissolved gas at low pressure (left) and at high pressure
        (right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Both Boyle’s and Henry’s laws are approximations, valid only
    for an ideal gas. But both laws do account for the general
    trends observed in real gases and liquids.</p>
<p>A rather pleasant applied example of Henry’s law is champagne
    (or any other bubbly drink). Champagne is bottled under elevated
    carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>, pressure and the amount of
    CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the water / alcohol mixture is
    thus higher than at normal ambient conditions. Upon opening
    the champagne bottle (decompression) CO<sub>2</sub> molecules
    (in little bubbles) will start to evaporate from the liquid
    until the appropriate, smaller amount of CO<sub>2</sub> remains
    dissolved in the liquid according to normal ambient pressure
    (at which point the champagne will have lost its sparkle…).</p>
<p>The normal atmosphere around us is roughly made up of ca. 80
    percent nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, and ca. 20 percent oxygen,
    O<sub>2</sub>, molecules (and a few, rare noble gas molecules)
    and the ambient pressure is taken as the ‘normal’ pressure
    of 1 atm. That is what we normally breathe and what our bodies
    are used to process through our blood and lungs. Keeping
    Henry’s and Boyle’s laws in mind, we can explain what can
    happen to a scuba diver from resurfacing from a deep dive
    too rapidly. At deep-dive conditions, the diver’s body will
    have been in an environment of elevated pressure, and more
    than the normal amount of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>    molecules will dissolve in their body fluids. As a result
    of insufficient decompression on resurfacing, mostly N<sub>2</sub>    gas bubbles will escape into body tissues where they will
    cause local damage and/or will block the regular blood flow
    to small peripheral blood vessels. This is known as decompression
    sickness. The solution to the problem is recompression with
    breathing elevated O<sub>2</sub> levels (HBO) at about three
    times the normal oxygen partial pressure (followed by controlled
    decompression).</p>
<p>A slightly different mechanism explains why HBO is an effective
    antidote to CO poisoning. The CO molecule has a greater affinity
    to the molecules in our blood that normally carry around
    O<sub>2</sub> molecules (hemoglobin). That means that O<sub>2</sub>    molecules at normal partial gas pressure will not be able
    to competitively eliminate the poisonous CO molecules from
    the body and the body will die from internal suffocation
    because the hemoglobin molecules cannot deliver O<sub>2</sub>    molecules to body tissues. In order for the O<sub>2</sub>    molecules to outcompete the CO molecules, much more O<sub>2</sub>    and at higher pressures than normal must be applied – HBO,
    again about three times the normal oxygen partial pressure,
    does the trick.</p>
<p>Of course, these basic principles of gas exchanges between different
    kinds of gases and between gas and liquid (or semi-liquid)
    phases are still in operation when HBO is used as a therapy
    to fight some <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">severe infections</a>    or to treat and/or prevent <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">tissue necroses</a>.
    In our rather simple examples above a roughly three-fold
    increase of partial oxygen pressure was mentioned. That is
    also the level of increased oxygen pressure used in these
    therapeutic sessions. The increased dissolution of O<sub>2</sub>    molecules during HBO sessions reverts to normal levels of
    concentrations in body fluids after decompression.</p>
<p>The therapeutic scenario when treating infections or bone necrosis
    with HBO is far more complicated than in our illustrative
    examples. Now a whole range of complicated biochemical and
    physiological relationships needs to be taken into account,
    none of which can be properly explained or understood in
    such simple terms and there will be no simple cause &amp;
    effect relationships.</p>
<p>First of all, the transport mechanism of O<sub>2</sub> around
    the body under HBO conditions is different from normal conditions.
    The hemoglobin molecules that normally carry O<sub>2</sub>    in arterial blood are more or less saturated by O<sub>2</sub>    molecules under normal pressure and O<sub>2</sub> concentration
    conditions (as in normal air). Under HBO conditions, the
    additional O<sub>2</sub> content is transported by the blood
    plasma. The biochemical and physiological implications of
    this modified transport mechanism are not known. Second,
    O<sub>2</sub> is a highly reactive chemical, an oxidizing
    agent with multiple roles in a cell’s metabolism. It is not
    well researched and not well understood exactly what effects
    increased O<sub>2</sub> levels have on the cellular metabolism
    and life cycle. It is a suggestion that increased O<sub>2</sub>    levels may be helpful because infected and necrotic tissues
    tend to have insufficient blood supply and thus tend to be
    hypoxic. This hypothesis has not been fully verified. What
    is known and reasonably well understood is the role of O<sub>2</sub>    in general in triggering and promoting angiogenesis and the
    synthesis of collagen (both important mechanisms in wound
    healing). Furthermore, HBO treatments may be problematic
    in the presence of active malignant disease as it is currently
    not possible to be certain that elevated O<sub>2</sub> levels
    do not fuel growth of malignant cells.</p>
<p>In addition, there is very little (if any) convincing evidence
    of the clinical effectiveness of HBO for the prevention and/or
    treatment of necrosis. The evidence base for the treatment
    of some severe infections (gangrene) is slightly more convincing.
    It is likely that the mechanisms by which HBO works for the
    treatment of (bacterial) infections is different from HBO
    effects on osteoradionecrosis.</p>
<p>It has been said that <a href="/treatment/other/further-reading">‘HBO is a treatment in search of diseases’</a>    and HBO treatment remains a controversial approach. In the
    light of lack of evidence (and understanding) there are currently
    two trials running in the UK, both closing in 2017: the
    <a href="/treatment/other/further-reading">HOPON and DAHNCA 21 trials</a>, investigating the role of
        HBO in the prevention and treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">osteoradionecrosis, ORN</a>        after radiotherapy in the head and neck region, respectively.
        For example, the HOPON trial, focusing on learning about
        the potential of HBO in the prevention of ORN, consistently
        prescribes a series of 20 HBO sessions before any invasive
        dental treatment such as a tooth extraction, and after
        such an intervention another 10 HBO sessions are prescribed.
        The outcomes of a large group of patients at risk of
        ORN treated in this way will be compared to the outcomes
        for a very similar patient group that is looked after
        and treated in quite the same way as the first group,
        except that the second group will not have had HBO sessions.</p>
