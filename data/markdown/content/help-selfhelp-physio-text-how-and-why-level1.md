<p>Physiotherapy helps restore movement and function when you are
    affected by injury, illness or disability. Physiotherapists
    can help through enabling movement and exercise, manual therapy,
    education and advice. Exercise is an important part of recovery
    following any injury or illness and has a proven record with
    regard to prevention of relapse in many conditions.</p>
<p>Following trauma, surgical intervention, or during and/or after
    radiotherapy treatment you may find that you are suffering
    from some dysfunction in the neck, shoulder, jaw or near
    any donor site you may have had. This also includes the mouth
    and tongue after major oral surgery – some aspects of
    <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapy</a> may well be viewed as physiotherapy
        for the mouth / tongue.</p>
<p>Joints and muscles like movement where ever they are in the body.
    Any joints or muscles that have been affected by trauma and/or
    surgery need to be moved as soon as you can to help reduce,
    and get over, any stiffness or weakness that may occur following
    such events. Some conditions such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">facial pain syndrome</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">jaw joint conditions</a>    benefit from physiotherapy as a prime treatment approach.</p>
<p> During and after radiotherapy in the head and neck region, physiotherapy
    and specific exercises have an important role to play in
    preventing the development of some unwanted effects from
    scarring of muscle tissue: this is a circumstance where prevention
    is much preferable over any attempts of cure.</p>
<p>The best physiotherapist in the world will not be able to help
    you, unless you engage in the process and take active steps
    to help yourself.</p>
