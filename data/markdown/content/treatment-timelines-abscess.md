<p>This is generally an acute condition which, if treated appropriately,
    should quickly resolve if the pus is drained and the cause
    removed.</p>
<h1 id="dental-abscess-simple-localised-to-gum">Dental abscess (simple, localised to gum)</h1>
<p><strong>Time-lines short term:</strong> responds within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> all signs of infection
    resolved within 7 days.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> only applicable if the
    cause is not removed. If the cause is not dealt with the
    abscess will recur over a period of months and years, possibly
    forming a chronic draining sinus called an odontogenic sinus.</p>
<h1 id="cervicofacial-abscess">Cervicofacial abscess</h1>
<p><strong>Time-lines short term:</strong> after drainage the drain
    may have to remain for 2-3 days to ensure there is no recollection
    of pus. The source must be removed. There is usually a lot
    of limitation of mouth opening, stiffness of the surrounding
    skin and discomfort even though you are getting better. There
    may be more swelling even though the pus has gone. Despite
    more swelling you usually find the pain improves rapidly,
    if it doesn’t there is likely to be a recollection of pus
    or it is not all drained.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> it can take 2 weeks
    to start to feel more “normal” after an abscess like this
    and for the swelling to settle by about 90%. At this stage
    it is not unusual to still have quite limited mouth opening.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> dependingon where the
    abscess was it can take weeks to months for normal mouth
    opening and jaw movement to occur. This is especially true
    with collections of pus underneath the large, powerful jaw
    closing muscles when it can take up to 6 months for full
    (normal for you) movement to happen.</p>
<h1 id="ludwigs-angina">Ludwig’s angina</h1>
<p><strong>Time-lines short term:</strong> this can be a life threatening
    condition and you may be in hospital for 7-10 days after
    drainage. Some people need the life supporting facilities
    of intensive care units and a breathing tube inserted through
    the nose for a few days. This is always preferred to a surgical
    opening into the airway as if that is needed the recovery
    time is much longer and the risks are higher.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> discharge after 7-10
    days but conventional home routine and work will be unlikely
    for another 2 weeks. Normal chewing, speaking and swallowing
    are unlikely during this time and may take several more weeks
    to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> a month or so after discharge
    you should be feeling more “normal” and slowly your jaw and
    mouth function will return. The incision lines where the
    drains were inserted will scar less well than normal surgical
    incisions and may have to be “revised” – cut out and done
    again in a more conventional fashion. This isn’t done the
    first time around because the pus needs to freely drain through
    an open wound not one that has been neatly stitched together.</p>
<h1 id="necrotising-fasciitis">Necrotising fasciitis</h1>
<p><strong>Time-lines short term:</strong> this is another life-threatening
    condition and may need a similar length of time in hospital
    as Ludwig’s angina. The major issue here is that skin and
    underlying tissue usually has to be cut away because the
    infection destroys it. This is usually dressed with antiseptic
    dressings before a planned <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> depending on the amount
    of skin and underlying tissue removed you may undergo a second
    operation while in hospital or go home for a series of weekly
    dressing changes until the infection is completely resolved
    and healthy underlying tissue has healed enough to accept
    a flap or graft.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> the main issue here is
    a second operation. The timeline follows that for the healing
    of a <a href="/treatment/timelines/reconstruction">flap or graft</a>.</p>
