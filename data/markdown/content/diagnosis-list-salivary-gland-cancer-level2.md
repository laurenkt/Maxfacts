    <p>If you’d like to read a concise summary of salivary gland
        anatomy and physiology alongside a description of the

        gland conditions, this information can be found <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-glands-summary">here</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>There is a huge and bewildering range of salivary neoplasms (see
    Table 1), the majority of which (70 - 80 %) are benign and
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">pleomorphic adenoma</a>    the most common of those.</p>

<p><strong>Adenoid cystic carcinoma</strong> is the most common
    malignancy in the sublingual gland and in minor salivary
    glands. It is slow growing with local invasion and has a
    particular predilection for neural invasion. It may produce
    ‘skip’ lesions such that there may be tumour left in nerves
    beyond a histologically clear resection margin. There is
    a slight female preponderance and it presents most frequently
    in patients in their fifties. It has a characteristic ‘Swiss
    cheese’ pattern on histology although there are several histological
    variants. Less than 10 % of patients have cervical (neck)
    lymph node involvement at presentation and 30 % will get
    regional or distant metastases at some point, although this
    may be in the quite distant future. Pulmonary (lung) metastases
    are particularly frequent with this malignancy.</p>
<p><strong>Mucoepidermoid carcinoma</strong> (made up of a mixture
    of mucus secreting cells and squamous (top layer of skin)
    cells) overall is probably the most common primary salivary
    gland malignancy. It presents in different grades of aggressiveness.
    There is an equal sex ratio, presentation is typically in
    the third to fifth decades and the majority of these tumours
    occur in the parotid glands. They are malignant but tend
    to behave in either a relatively indolent way, or an aggressively
    malignant way in which regional and distant metastases are
    common. Attempts to identify and separate these behaviours
    on histological grounds early have been the subject of controversy
    as 30 % of tumours that look like low-grade lesions histologically
    behave aggressively, and 30 % of those that appear high-grade
    lesions behave in a more benign fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Acinic cell (secreting cells) carcinomas</strong> account
    for a minority of salivary gland tumours. 90 % of acinic
    cell carcinomas occur in the parotid glands. 80 % of these
    tumours are relatively indolent and 20 % are highly aggressive,
    but (much more so than for mucoepidermoid carcinoma; see
    above), the histology struggles to predict the tumour’s behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Carcinoma ex</strong> <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems"><strong>pleomorphic salivary adenoma</strong></a>    is a highly malignant tumour that arises within a pre-existing
    pleomorphic salivary adenoma that has usually been present
    for many years. After about 10 years the incidence of malignancy
    in a pleomorphic salivary adenoma is about 1 % per year.
    Sudden growth, pain, facial nerve weakness or painful facial
    nerve palsy from tumour infiltration in a long-standing parotid
    lump are highly suggestive of malignant transformation.</p>
<p>Carcinoma ex pleomorphic salivary adenoma</p>
<ul>
    <li>is a rare, aggressive malignancy</li>
    <li>is the most common of three types of malignant mixed tumours
        of salivary glands</li>
    <li>male to female ratio is 2 : 1</li>
    <li>occurs usually in older patients (6<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup>        decade) who have a pleomorphic adenoma in situ for many
        years (typically 10-15 years)</li>
    <li>has an overall 5 year survival rate of 30 %</li>
    <li>leads to regional metastasis in 50 % of patients</li>
    <li>has a high rate of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastasis</a>        at the time of diagnosis (25 - 76 %), typically to brain,
        bone, lung and local lymph nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other malignancies</strong> such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other">mesenchymal tumours (soft / connective tissue tumours)</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other">lymphoma</a> may
    occur in the salivary glands. Secondary deposits (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>)
    can occur and metastasis from a primary skin tumour to an
    intra-parotid node is the most frequent cause of a malignant
    parotid mass in areas of the world with a high incidence
    of cancer of the scalp. Polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma
    (originating from tissue lining the gland) is worth remembering
    as it is frequently difficult to distinguish histologically
    but is generally an indolent malignancy with a good prognosis.</p>
<p>In addition, consideration should be given to malignant mixed
    salivary gland tumours. According to the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">World Health Organisation</a>    these are</p>
<ul>
    <li>carcinoma ex pleomorphic salivary adenoma (see above)</li>
    <li>carcinosarcoma (a rare true mixed malignant tumour; almost
        always also arises from pre-existing pleomorphic salivary
        adenoma)</li>
    <li>metastasising pleomorphic salivary adenoma (which remains
        something of a controversy).</li>
</ul>
