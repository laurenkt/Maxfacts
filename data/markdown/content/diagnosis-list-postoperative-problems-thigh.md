<p>Postoperative problems affecting the thigh include</p>
<ul>
    <li>The principal problems arising after maxillofacial (<a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>)
        procedures on the thigh are either from split skin graft
        harvesting or vastus lateralis (large and powerful thigh
        muscle, running from the top/side to the front/middle
        and connecting there to the knee) / anterolateral thigh
        (ALT) free flap (a free skin, fat and/or fascia flap
        from that region of the thigh) harvest.</li>
    <li>Skin graft. Painful raw superficial wound is left to granulate
        so the wrap around dressing is very important. The area
        will look and feel raw for at least 10 days even if not
        infected or irritated. If that happens it will be raw
        and painful for longer.</li>
    <li>Vastus/ALT flap. Numbness in the area is common but often
        not noticed. A drain will be in place for a day or two.
        Haematoma (accumulation of clotted blood in tissue) and
        especially seroma (accumulation of blood plasma in tissue)
        formation is quite common. It is usually possible to
        walk normally a day or two after the operation. This
        may be why seroma is common. Even damage to the motor
        nerve to the vastus lateralis muscle seems to make little
        difference to quadriceps function (quadriceps is the
        large group of muscles in front of the thigh that extend
        the leg). Wound infection is possible but very rare as
        the defect is closed primarily. Running subcuticular
        (under the skin) sutures avoid cross hatching scars and
        the need to remove sutures or staples.</li>
