<p>The role of chemotherapy in oral cancer is at present small but
    will continue to evolve even if only because drug companies
    will continue to seek new markets for existing products.</p>
<p>To date the impact of a range of drugs on oral cancer treatment
    has been very disappointing. <a href="/treatment/surgery">Surgery</a>    and <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> remain the two
    key treatment modalities on a curative basis.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles">Chemotherapy agents</a>    commonly used in head and neck cancer are 5-fluorouracil,
    cisplatin or carboplatin and methotrexate. EGFR (epidermal
    growth factor receptor) targeting drugs, tyrosine kinase
    inhibitors and taxanes have all been used in <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/further-reading">trials</a>.
    Limited roles for <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles">cetuximab and taxanes</a>    have been identified.</p>
