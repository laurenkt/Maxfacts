<p>Detection of a child with a cleft by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>    is possible as the shape of the face is detectable by the
    14<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. Parents may well have
    been advised that their child will have a cleft. This does
    help parents come to terms with the shock of having a child
    with a cleft. It does however remain common for them to experience
    feelings of guilt and regret and they often require time
    to effectively grieve for the loss of the anticipated ‘normal’
    child. Parents may at this time be helped by taking photographs
    of the child with the cleft as this child effectively vanishes
    once the initial repair has been carried out.</p>
<p>At the point of diagnosis, home support by a specialist health
    visitor to assist with bonding between parents and child
    and help with feeding is useful. Directed flow of milk into
    the mouth using soft bottles and positioning the child will
    allow the child to be adequately nourished. A range of useful
    bottles and teats are available and can be obtained in the
    UK from the Cleft Lip and Palate Association, a cleft support
    group. At this stage a brief but positive explanation of
    the process by which the child’s cleft will be repaired over
    time is essential.</p>
<p>Most centres in the UK have limited active intervention at this
    time although world-wide a variety of pre-surgical orthopaedic
    techniques have been advocated at this point. Although practice
    varies throughout the world these are not currently in vogue
    in the UK. In Germany pre-surgical nasoalveolar molding (NAM)
    therapy is becoming increasingly popular. The first long
    term results from New York look very promising. The practice
    in the USA varies considerably.</p>
<h2>Timing of Surgery</h2>
<p>The precise details of the timing of surgery will vary depending
    on the individual case. A commonly used protocol includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>lip and / or alveolus and / or soft palate repair at three
        to six months old;</li>
    <li>repair of residual palatal defect at nine to twelve months
        old;</li>
    <li>audiology +/- myringotomy (drainage incision in the ear drum)
        either at this time or as indicated by audiological assessment;</li>
    <li>formal speech assessment around two-years old;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/cleft-lip-palate/detailed">pharyngeal surgery</a>        if indicated by <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapy</a>        assessment at four to five-years old;</li>
    <li>alveolar bone grafting assessment at age eight years, followed
        by actual <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">alveolar bone grafting</a>        between the ages of nine and eleven;</li>
    <li>definitive orthodontics with or without <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic surgery</a>        between the ages of 15 and 18-years old;</li>
    <li>definitive <a href="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level2">rhinoplasty</a>        plus definitive <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative dentistry</a>        at age 18-years plus.</li>
</ul>
