<p>Having to temporarily, short- or medium term, rely on
    bypassing the oral cavity and/or throat for feeding
    (enteral tube feeding) is a fairly common circumstance
    in major maxillofacial surgery. For example,
    approximately 70 % of people treated for head &amp; neck
    malignancies at some stage will need some tube-feeding
    support. For the majority of people this is a temporary,
    often short-term condition.</p>
<p>In maxillofacial surgery the need usually is just to
    bypass the oral cavity and/or throat, and digestion in
    the stomach and beyond is not impaired. This is the
    background for the two most common forms of tube feeding
    in these circumstances: a nasogastric (NG) tube placed
    through the nose and inserted down the oesophagus into
    the stomach, or a gastrostomy; either percutaneous
    endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) where the tube is inserted
    directly into the stomach through the wall of the
    abdomen, radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) or
    very rarely open gastrostomy. Broadly speaking, NG tubes
    are mostly used for short- or medium-term needs, usually
    for periods shorter than three months. A gastrostomy is
    typically considered for medium- to long-term needs
    (Figure 1). Long-term needs may be a complete reliance
    on a gastrostomy for all food and drink, or to use a
    gastrostomy as a means to supplement <a href="/help/oral-food">oral food intake</a>.</p>

<p>There are numerous aspects to consider, apart from the
    obvious purpose of tube feeding – providing nutrition
    when oral food intake is difficult or impossible. It is
    fair to say that opinions are split for almost all these
    aspects, and for some of these debates there is not much
    of a robust body of evidence / information to firmly
    support one or the other approach. The general consensus
    probably does not reach much further than the broad
    agreement that excessive weight loss and malnutrition
    should be prevented in the first place, but certainly
    warrant counteracting once developing or established.
    The literature repeatedly reports a strong correlation
    between malnutrition and poor outcomes. There also seems
    to be general acknowledgment of a strong correlation
    between malnutrition / eating difficulties and <a href="/help/mental-health/getting-started">depression</a>.
    Below we sketch a summary of various questions,
    considerations and arguments related to tube feeding.
</p>
<p><strong>When should a (short-term support) NG tube be
        placed?</strong> There are undoubtedly circumstances
    after major oral and maxillofacial surgery where a NG
    feeding tube is necessary to protect a surgical wound,
    to maintain nutrition and/or sometimes to prevent <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">oral
        infections</a>. Similarly, there are postoperative
    circumstances where there is really no need to place a
    temporary NG. To a large extent all situations between
    these two extremes are a matter of opinion and often
    follow local/regional established pathways and
    procedures rather than robust evidence. For example, the
    short-term postoperative use of NG tubes after
    relatively minor surgical interventions is far more
    common in Germany than in the UK. The argument for
    generous use of postoperative NG tubes in Germany often
    is the prevention of oral infections. However, the oral
    cavity is never a sterile or even ‘clean’ environment
    and one can argue that meticulous <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a> and
    guidance &amp; support postoperatively goes a long way
    in preventing infections and the need for NG tubes. In
    fact, meticulous oral hygiene is even more important
    when using a NG tube – in preventing infections!</p>
<p>There is a longstanding debate about the prophylactic
    placement of a NG tube (or PEG/RIG; see below) at the
    beginning of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>
    treatment to the maxillofacial region. Opinions diverge
    here strongly. Some argue that the adverse effects of
    radiotherapy (painful <a href="/treatment/surgery/oral-mucosal-lesions/detailed">mucositis</a>
    in particular) are so common that the majority of people
    undergoing high-energy irradiation regimens will
    eventually need support by a feeding tube anyway, so why
    not place a tube ready to be used at the beginning of
    the radiotherapy scheme. Others argue that feeding tubes
    should only be considered when there is really no
    alternative, that clever management of difficulties,
    attention to detail, appropriate support and <a href="/help/oral-food">suitable forms of oral
        food</a> may help many more people through such
    periods without having to rely on tube feeding. The
    argument about maintaining some swallowing as much as
    possible at all times weighs even more heavily where it
    comes to dealing with the management of the adverse
    effects of radiotherapy. There are pronounced and
    lasting effects of radiotherapy on the soft (and hard)
    tissues of the head and neck region. Supporting some
    swallowing activity, even under temporarily difficult
    circumstances, may be considered as some special form of
    <a href="/help/salt">physiotherapy exercise</a>, aiming
    at maximally preserving and restoring swallowing
    functionality. There does not seem to be any conclusive
    evidence as to the short- and long-term benefits (or
    lack thereof) of prophylactic placement of feeding tubes
    at the beginning of head &amp; neck radiotherapy
    treatment as opposed to placing a feeding tube only when
    definitely needed. There is, however, consensus that
    return to near pre-treatment swallowing is quicker when
    tube feeding is not used. This seems to be due to a
    combination of psychological and physiological reasons.
    The difference is even more marked between nasogastric
    feeding and gastrostomy feeding. The main difference in
    opinion amongst professionals seems to be the threshold
    for when enteral feeding cannot be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>When should a (short-term support) NG tube be
        removed?</strong> The answer to this question is
    simple: as soon as is safe/ reasonable / possible. A
    return to some degree of <a href="/help/oral-food">oral
        food intake</a>, be it <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">texture-modified or
        otherwise adapted foods</a> (temporarily or
    permanently) or a ‘normal’ diet, is a major contributing
    factor to recovery and wellbeing. The removal of a NG
    tube after a probably difficult and unpleasant period is
    a real milestone for most people. Apart from these
    holistic considerations, one can also make more
    technical arguments to support an approach aiming for
    the shortest possible duration of NG tube feeding. It
    has been shown that for some people over time some form
    of tube dependency can develop along some fear of
    returning to oral food (with mostly children and elderly
    people affected). This effect can be reduced by keeping
    the NG tube feeding episode as short as possible.
    Another argument that has been made repeatedly is the
    lack of training effect on the muscles that support the
    <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowing
        act</a> if tube feeding is used for longer periods,
    following the general idea of ‘use it or loose it’. If
    more swallowing competence and ability is lost over
    extended periods of tube feeding, it only makes the
    return to oral food harder and more ‘relearning’ is
    needed. Finally, in principle a healthy and balanced
    diet is easier to provide with oral food intake, even
    when having to rely on texture-modified food, than when
    relying on feeding-tube formula (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Which type of feeding tube, NG, PEG or RIG,
        should be chosen?</strong> Generally speaking, NG
    tubes cater for short-term needs, gastrostomy is more
    suitable for longer-term needs. The advantage of a NG
    tube is that its placement is a less invasive
    intervention than the placement of a PEG or RIG. Both
    types of tubes are similarly quick and easy to remove –
    they just need to be pulled. The insertion of a PEG is
    usually a minimally invasive, endoscopically guided
    procedure, a RIG is done with an NG tube in place under
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>
    guidance; an open surgical approach is rarely used.
    Different feeding strategies, either mimicking several
    meals per day or some more continual, slow drip-feed
    approach, are possible with both types of tubes. A
    gastrostomy is a more lasting ‘installation’ but needs
    regular replacement. With a view to long-term feeding
    needs, a gastrostomy is more stable, allowing for more
    flexibility and mobility, and is more discrete as it is
    not visible under normal clothes. A gastrostomy tube
    typically lasts for half a year before it needs
    replacing with a new tube.</p>
<p>There is a consensus on NG tubes being disliked intensely
    whereas gastrostomy, once in place, seems to be better
    tolerated. Certainly from the maxillofacial surgery
    perspective, once people have got used to a gastrostomy
    it is difficult to wean them off it, whereas people
    can’t wait to get rid of NG tubes.</p>
<p><strong>What are commercial feeding formulae made
        of?</strong> There are numerous different brands and
    liquid preparations for tube feeding. These formulae
    follow general composition guidelines according to
    normal requirements of macro- and micronutrients,
    carbohydrates, proteins, fat and fibres, plus trace
    elements and vitamins, respectively.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about macro- and
        micronutrients, this information is on our page
        about <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">nutrition</a>.
    </p>
</aside>
<p>These formulae satisfy recommendations as to the amounts
    of calories and composition. Unfortunately, they do so
    by mixing ingredients that nobody would normally
    consider as components of a healthy diet. Much of the
    calories is made up by sugar (corn syrup a common
    component, glucose and fructose), protein is usually
    provided by soy bean products or milk proteins of all
    kinds, many use fats derived from palm oil, mostly
    triglycerides and fibre components vary widely with some
    preparations short on fibres. Micronutrients are added
    to the preparations to cover trace element and vitamin
    supplies.</p>
<p>It is evident that these preparations are not the
    equivalent of a healthy balanced diet. These formulae
    provide the basic needs in terms of quantities but one
    may be tempted to view them as a diet consisting of
    liquefied doughnuts enhanced by vitamin tablets. Many
    people relying on these formulae have problems with
    indigestion, constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea
    and other forms of food intolerance. This is a serious
    concern especially for long-term feeding. Some of the
    intolerance problems can be minimised by using different
    formulae and different feeding regimens (‘long and thin’
    as opposed to bolus feeding) but usually intolerance
    problems cannot be completely resolved in these ways.
    The high sugar content is less than ideal for all but is
    highly problematic for anybody suffering from diabetes.
</p>
<p>If long-term tube feeding cannot be avoided, it may take
    some effort to find a workable regimen. An alternative
    to commercial formulae are blended liquid diets,
    prepared from ‘normal’ foods at home. Until the
    introduction of commercial formulae for tube feeding,
    this used to be the only way to eat with a feeding tube.
    There are many patient reports that blended liquid diets
    can work better than commercial formulae. It is a viable
    and good alternative for some, but may not work for all.

        disadvantages of blended liquid diets, this

<p><strong>What are the most common difficulties encountered
        with tube feeding?</strong> Feeding tubes as such
    normally do not cause discomfort. However, there is one
    very common difficulty with short- and long-term use of
    tube feeding: <a href="/help/non-oral-food/detailed">intolerance to
        the various commercial formulae</a> (see above).
    Feeding tubes have fairly small diameters in order to
    minimise discomfort (similar to the diameter of a small
    drinking straw). This explains another common problem, a
    blockage of the tube. Most commonly, such blockages are
    caused by medications applied through the tube, or by
    not sufficiently flushing the tube with water before and
    after eating. In most blockage cases, a little
    perseverance, patience and gentle nudging with the help
    of warm water or a fizzy liquid will resolve the issue.
