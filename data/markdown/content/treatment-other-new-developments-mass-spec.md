<p>We look into the basic working principles of an analytical technique
    widely used in chemistry, biochemistry and beyond - mass
    spectrometry. This analytical technique has recently been
    demonstrated to permit real-time distinction of healthy and
    malignant tissue in the operating theatre in breast and ovarian
    tumour surgery, when combined with <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">diathermy</a>    (electrical cutting devices). The intention is to have a
    quick and reliable way to characterise the surgical margins
    as free of malignant tissue after tumour resection. The mass
    spectrometry-based technique is currently (2019) being explored
    and evaluated for similar applications in maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that allows the
    identification of unknown molecules, or confirmation that
    certain molecules are present in a sample, as well as quantification
    of different components in a mixture of chemicals. In many
    instances the composition of a sample can be analysed quantitively.
    In comparison with other analytical methods, mass spectrometry
    only requires small amounts of sample. Mass spectrometry
    is basically a brute-force method, and all mass spectrometers
    work by the same principles. Figure 1 depicts the schematic
    set-up of a mass spectrometer.</p>

</figure>
<p>The sample is introduced into the mass spectrometer <i>via</i>    the sample inlet. The sample then is ionised. ‘Ionised’ is
    an elegant wording for saying the molecules get smashed (in
    some way, by hitting the sample with electrons; there are
    ‘softer’ and ‘harder’ ways to bombard the molecules in the
    sample and the technique chosen depends on the application).
    At least some of the electrons which hold the molecule together
    are knocked out, and many of the evaporated molecules will
    fall apart into a number of ionic fragments. These fragments
    are characteristic of each individual chemical compound.
    This happens in the section of the mass spectrometer called
    the ionisation chamber, which is a vacuum chamber. Once ionised,
    the molecular ion and/or molecular fragments can be transported
    by electric or magnetic fields to the part of the spectrometer
    called the mass analyser (sometimes also called the ion separator).
    There are many different technical ways in which the mixture
    of different charged fragments at this stage can be sorted,
    according to their respective mass and/or charge. The choice
    of methodology depends on the particular application. Once
    sorted, the particles reach the detector where they are registered
    by recording the current or the charge induced by the various
    ions hitting the detector. Also for this detector part of
    a mass spectrometer a number of different technical solutions
    exist. These solutions usually require some form of signal
    amplification as there is only a very small number of molecular
    ions and fragments hitting the detector. The final output
    from the mass spectrometer is a chart that depicts all the
    components in the sample as characterised by their mass-to-charge
    (m/z) ratios.</p>
<p>Figure 2 depicts a schematic view of such a hypothetical chart
    for a particular molecule. From the ionic fragments and the
    molecular ion present, one can reconstruct the original molecule,
    if structure determination is the aim of the experiment.</p>

        mass spectrum of the molecule propan-1-ol.</figcaption>

<p>More commonly, analytical laboratory methods will be needed to
    analyse the composition of a mixture of chemicals (for example,
    in a blood or urine sample, or to distinguish genuine Bordeaux
    wine from fake versions, and many other applications), and
    to quantify the relative amount of the different components
    in the mixture (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-mass-spec-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A schematic view of mass spectrometry
        charts obtained for mixtures of chemicals A (red) and
        B (blue). Top: mixture composed of A, with some B added;
        bottom: mixture mainly composed of A, with only little
        B added.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For this quantification based on relative peak intensities in
    the charts to work, the fragment patterns of the pure components
    in the mixture need to be known, so that the various peaks
    can be assigned to the different components. This is essentially
    the approach taken for surgical applications of mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>A particular version of a mass spectrometry (rapid evaporation
    ionisation mass spectrometry, REIMS) is used for surgical
    applications, in conjunction with an <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">electrical surgical cutting device</a>    (diathermy) in the operating theatre. Figure 4 illustrates
    the general set-up.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-mass-spec-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> A schematic view of an electric
        surgical cutting device, coupled to mass spectrometer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cutting tissue with an electrical device strongly heats the tissue,
    producing ‘surgical smoke’ by evaporating tissue. The vapour
    is captured at the surgical incision site and is delivered
    to a (slightly remotely placed) mass spectrometer. The vapour
    consists of a complicated mixture of biological molecules
    that make up the cells of the evaporated tissue.</p>
<p>The general principle illustrated in Figure 3 is used to distinguish
    healthy and malignant tissues from their respective vapour
    composition. Both healthy and malignant tissues are composed
    of the same basic components. However, the different tissues
    differ in the relative abundance of these components. It
    has been demonstrated further that different types of malignant
    tumours can be distinguished by their mass spectrometry tissue
    fingerprint. One type of biological molecules that gives
    rise to such distinctive mass spectrometry charts of breast
    tissue are phospholipids. Phospholipid profiles in mass spectrometry
    charts were used with some success in breast surgery. Comparing
    the real-time data recorded in the operating theatre to data
    from a suitable data base, together with careful statistical
    analysis allows for rapid distinction between healthy and
    malignant tissues.</p>
<p>The approach has the potential to optimise surgical margins by
    ensuring that enough, but not more than necessary, tissue
    has been resected. Obviously, the method relies on <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">diathermy</a>    being the principal cutting device; cutting with a scalpel
    does not produce surgical smoke. Diathermy may not in all
    circumstances be the optimal cutting device. Alternative
    real-time assessment techniques (such as <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/raman-spectroscopy">Raman spectroscopy</a>)
    that work with other cutting devices are also being explored.
    Further, the method relies on the identification of suitable
    molecular profile candidates to distinguish healthy and diseased
    tissues. In addition, a high-quality data base of profiles
    for the relevant types of tissues needs to be established
    in order to have a reliable statistical result.</p>
<p>These requirements need to be explored and examined for maxillofacial
    surgery, before diathermy in conjunction with REIMS can be
    established as a standard assessment tool for surgical margins
    in maxillofacial surgery. Mass spectrometry based methods
    will have to compare favourably with the use of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">frozen sections</a>    (comparator for immediacy of results), definitive pathology
    of the resected specimen (comparator for accuracy of results)
    and survival aspects, including quality of life (comparator
    for relevance). Alternative real-time assessment techniques
    (such as <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/raman-spectroscopy">Raman spectroscopy</a>)
    that work with other cutting devices are also currently being
    explored.</p>
<p>The scenario for oral and maxillofacial surgery may turn out
    significantly different from the situation encountered in
    the surgery of solid malignant tumours in other parts of
    the body, such as the breast.</p>
