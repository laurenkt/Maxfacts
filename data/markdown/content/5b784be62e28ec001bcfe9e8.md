<p>The thyroid gland secretes a number of hormones that all play
    central roles in the regulation of the body’s general metabolism.
    One hormone synthesised in, and released from the thyroid
    gland when Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration levels in the
    plasma are high, is <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/calcitonin">calcitonin</a>.
    The role of calcitonin is to slow bone resorption in the
    normal <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">bone remodelling process</a>.
    The counterplayer to calcitonin is parathyroid hormone,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/pth">PTH</a> which upregulates bone resorption and the bone remodelling
        process. Between these two hormones and their actions,
        a bone remodelling balance is achieved if both hormones
        are secreted as they should be and if all feedback loops
        are working well in this regulated system.</p>
<p>Another highly complicated, regulated system is the chain of
    events that leads to the release of the two thyroid hormones
    tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine), T4 and triiodothyronine,
    T3 (Figure 1). These two hormones are at the centre of regulating
    the general metabolic rates of many body functions, including
    breathing and heart rates, digestive functions, body temperature,
    muscle strength and nervous system functions.</p>

<p>The command centre for the release of thyroid hormone is a small
    but vitally important region at the base of the brain, the
    hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing
    hormone, TRH which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland
    (situated close to the hypothalamus) to secret thyroid-stimulating
    hormone, TSH. The levels of TSH regulate the synthesis and
    release of thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland. The amount
    of thyroid hormones circulating in the blood determines the
    level of TSH release such that a tight control and feedback
    loop is maintained to keep the T3/T4 concentrations in a
    narrow functional window. T4 is essentially the quick-release,
    circulating storage version of the active form of the hormone,
    T3. The conversion from T4 to T3 permits rapid response to
    the body’s situation-dependant metabolic requirements. The
    chemistry of T4/T3 is unusual for hormones in that both molecules
    contain three (T3) or four (T4) iodine atoms. To maintain
    a healthy supply of iodine to enable the synthesis of T3/T4
    in the thyroid gland, a sufficient amount of iodine needs
    to be supplied by the diet. This could be either from natural
    sources such as seafish, or from supplementation (or use
    of iodised salt) where the local / personal diet is short
    of iodine. A sufficient dietary iodine supply helps to prevent
    the development of goitre, the swelling of the thyroid gland
    in response to insufficient dietary iodine intake.</p>
<p>Both overactivity (hyperthyroidism) and underactivity (hypothyroidism)
    of the thyroid gland (or dysfunction elsewhere in the command
    chain regulating hormone release from the thyroid gland)
    lead to sometimes severe clinical signs and symptoms that
    need to be addressed. In a nutshell, underactivity of the
    thyroid gland or complete lack of thyroid hormones (for example,
    after removal of the thyroid gland) needs to be managed by
    replacing the missing hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism may
    be managed in different ways by a range of different medications
    to reduce thyroid gland activity levels (for example by carbimazole,
    a <a href="/treatment-other-medication-delivery-level3">pro-drug</a>    that reduces the amount of T3/T4 produced in the thyroid
    gland), by a targeted form of radiotherapy with radioactive
    iodine, <sup>131</sup>I (which selectively accumulates in
    the thyroid gland and destroys it), or by surgical removal
    of some or all of the thyroid gland. Some maxillofacial surgeons
    carry out tumour-related thyroid (and parathyroid) surgery
    but always in conjunction with medical endocrinologists.</p>
<p>Diagnostics (mainly <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">clinical examination</a>    and a number of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">specific blood tests</a>)
    and management of thyroid disorders generally fall into the
    remit of ear, nose and throat as well as endocrinology specialties
    rather than maxillofacial surgery. There is, however, one
    notable exception where maxillofacial surgery in collaboration
    with ophthalmology is involved in the management of the most
    common cause for exophthalmus (bulging eyes).</p>
<p>Grave’s disease (also known as Basedow’s disease in Europe) is
    an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">autoimmune condition</a>    that affects the thyroid gland and leads to overactivity
    of the gland. One of the signs of the condition is Grave’s
    ophthalmopathy (bulging eyes) which results from inflammation
    of the tissues surrounding the eyes in the eye socket. If
    exophthalmus persists long after otherwise satisfactory management
    of Grave’s disease, or if the eye condition is such that
    there is a risk for vision loss from compression of the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">optic nerve</a>, then maxillofacial surgical intervention
        is required. The main surgical intervention is orbital
        decompression surgery, where removing some small bone
        segments from the eye sockets (orbits) provides decompression
        such that the protruding eye balls can settle back into
        a normal position and any pressure on the optic nerve
        can be relieved. There may also be some corrective surgery
        to improve function and appearance of the eyelid and
        / or on the muscles responsible for the synchronised
        movement of both eyes when diplopia (double vision) is
        a persistent problem. Double vision may develop as a
        complication of orbital decompression surgery. Maxillofacial
        surgical interventions are the same when exophthalmus
        is caused by other underlying conditions than thyroid
        diseases.</p>
