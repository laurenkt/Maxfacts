<p>Anticoagulant medications (mistakenly called ‘blood thinners’)
    are a group of substances, widely prescribed in the prevention
    and treatment of venous thrombosis, the blocking of a smooth
    blood flow in the veins by a clot (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiplatelet">antiplatelet medications</a>    are used for very similar purposes addressing conditions
    of the arteries).</p>
<p>Anticoagulants are widely used because cardiovascular diseases
    (such as cardiac conditions) are extremely common conditions
    in the western world. For example, coronary heart disease
    (a heart attack) can be a fatal event. Anticoagulants are
    also widely used in dialysis and in heart bypass surgery,
    and in the aftercare following surgery in general (to prevent
    deep vein thrombosis, DVT, as a possible consequence of immobility).</p>
<p>The main mode of action of anticoagulants is their ability to
    reduce the formation of a protein, thrombin, or to block
    its action. Thrombin, in turn is essential to turn soluble
    fibrinogen into networks of insoluble fibrin (a main component
    of a blood clot); reduced thrombin activities thus reduce
    the formation and growth of venous blood clots. Fibrin is
    more important in the formation and stability of clots in
    veins, whereas platelets have a more important role in clot
    formation in arteries.</p>
<p>The two most widely used anticoagulants are heparin and warfarin;
    both substances have been known for a long time (heparin
    was discovered over 100 years ago, an early version of warfarin
    has been known for 80 years).</p>
<p><strong>Heparin</strong> in therapeutic doses is commonly used
    in surgical aftercare, in the form of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">subcutaneous (under the skin) injections</a>,
    it cannot be taken orally because the substance cannot be
    absorbed from the intestines. Heparin is a naturally occurring,
    large molecule that is also produced in small quantities
    by the immune system.</p>
<p>Derivatives of <strong>warfarin</strong> are also naturally occurring
    substances that are produced by some fungi. Warfarin is a
    small molecule (see Figure 1) and can be taken orally.</p>

</figure>
<p>Warfarin is the most widely used anticoagulant, not least because
    its function can be reversed if necessary. The antidote to
    warfarin (to stop excessive bleeding) is vitamin K, a vitamin
    that is necessary in the cascade of blood clotting events.
    Warfarin inhibits the vitamin-K dependent biosynthesis of
    several of the blood clotting factors (proteins).</p>
<p>Nature uses anticoagulants in other circumstances too: for example,
    the saliva of some spiders, snakes, ticks and leeches contains
    anticoagulants. More recent developments of more specific
    synthetic anticoagulant medications have taken inspiration
    from these ‘bio-molecules’.  </p>
<p>A maxillofacial clinic certainly is not the place for the treatment
    of cardiovascular conditions. However, a number of maxillofacial
    patients will be on long-term medication with anticoagulant
    drugs. This can be relevant for maxillofacial treatment planning
    and prescription of medications because all anticoagulant
    (and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiplatelet">antiplatelet</a>)
    medications have in common that they <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">interfer with many other medications</a>    and foods, as well as increasing the risk for bleeding.</p>
