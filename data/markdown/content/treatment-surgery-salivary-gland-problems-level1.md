<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about location and structure of
        the salivary glands, this information is in our section
        about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read a concise summary of salivary gland
        anatomy and physiology alongside a description of the
        diagnostic toolbox commonly used in investigating salivary
        gland conditions, this information can be found <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-glands-summary">here</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">Non-malignant conditions affecting the salivary glands</a>    are diverse. The corresponding treatment options are equally
    diverse and may include one or several of the following modalities</p>
<ul>
    <li>any underlying infections require appropriate <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotic medication</a>        (for example, acute or chronic bacterial infection of
        a salivary gland);</li>
    <li>acute and/or chronic pain requires appropriate <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">management</a>,
        by medication or otherwise;</li>
    <li>some conditions require <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">surgical intervention</a>        such as resection (removal) of the affected salivary
        gland(s) (for example, after prolonged infection);</li>
    <li>some conditions require <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">surgical interventions</a>        other than resection of the gland (for example, removal
        of obstructions such as calculi (stones) by open or endoscopic
        (keyhole) surgery);</li>
    <li>some conditions require long-term management (for example,
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry mouth)</a>        caused by Sjögren’s syndrome, or by <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        or drooling).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">Malignancies of the salivary glands</a>    and their <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/salivary-gland-cancer">treatment</a>    are discussed separately. Some of the surgical interventions
    to treat these malignancies are not fundamentally different
    from some of the surgical techniques for the treatment of
    non-malignant conditions of salivary glands discussed in
    this section.</p>
