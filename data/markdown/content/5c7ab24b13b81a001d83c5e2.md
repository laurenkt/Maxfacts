<p>The immune system’s role in the defence of the body requires
    it to recognise and destroy foreign and faulty cells, including
    malignant cells. In humans (and other mammals) this defence
    system is a sophisticated mechanism, made up of two interlinked
    components. The innate immune system provides a rapid, non-specific
    response; the adaptive immune system uses specialised white
    blood cells to produce a slower but specific response to
    invaders, in addition to creating and maintaining a memory
    of such events and invaders.</p>
<p>The interplay of these different layers of the human immune system
    is discussed in our section about <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>,
    with a focus on <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">wound healing</a>    and autoimmune diseases such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">Sjögren’s syndrome</a>.
    In the context of immunotherapies, below we take a look at
    the immune system from a slightly different angle. The focus
    here is on the different types of white blood cells (lymphocytes)
    and their specific properties and roles as these are key
    for all immunotherapy strategies, aiming to exploit the body’s
    own defence system to eradicate malignancies.</p>
<p>The idea to counteract malignant diseases by exploiting the body’s
    own defence mechanisms is as old as the growing understanding
    of the immune system. The idea has been discussed for at
    least 100 years but significant clinical progress in applying
    such strategies in the treatment of some malignancies, in
    particular some forms of breast, skin and lung cancers has
    only happened in the last decade.  </p>
<h1 id="an-overview-of-white-blood-cells-and-other-key-components-in-the-immune-system"><strong>An overview of white blood cells and other key components in the immune system</strong></h1>
<p>The ‘work force’ of the immune system is made up of a number
    of specialised white blood cells, and a number of additional
    components to support the overall function and communication
    flow of the immune system. Figure 1 gives an overview of
    these key components necessary to provide an adequate immune
    response.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The key components involved in
        an immune response</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li>B cells - a type of white blood cells, a sub-type of lymphocytes;
        continuously produced in the bone marrow; mostly found
        circulating in the lymphatic system; part of the adaptive
        immune system; carry out the synthesis of specific antigens
        (see below); dealing with invaders of the body fluids
        outside cells (this is called the humoral immune response).</li>
    <li>T cells - another type of lymphocytes; produced in the thymus
        (a gland in the chest); mostly found circulating in the
        lymphatic system; part of the adaptive immune system;
        identifying foreign invaders (antigens; see below) with
        the help of specialised receptors (proteins) on the T
        cell surface; two types of T cells with different properties:
        cytotoxic T cells (kill infected and malignant cells)
        and helper T cells (modulate and support the overall
        immune response).</li>
    <li>Antigens - substances, typically proteins on the surface
        of pathogens that stimulate an immune response; bind
        to antibodies and, in modified form, to T cell receptors.</li>
    <li>Antibodies - proteins produced by B cells in response to
        the presence of antigens; trigger an antigen-specific
        immune response (each type of antibody recognises a particular
        antigen); can be found attached to B cells circulating
        in the bloodstream.</li>
    <li>Cytokines - large variety of small protein molecules, released
        by various cells of the immune system; act as messenger
        molecules in regulating the immune response.</li>
    <li>Major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) - proteins expressed
        by many body cells to label cells as belonging to the
        body (‘self’); required for (partially broken down) antigens
        to bind to T cell receptors (said to be ‘presenting’
        antigen fragments to the T cell receptors); two types
        of MHC proteins: MHC-I proteins present to cytotoxic
        T cells, MHC-II proteins present to helper T cells, followed
        by the corresponding immune response(s).</li>
    <li>Natural killer cells – a type of lymphocyte, mostly found
        circulating in the bloodstream; part of the innate immune
        system; act in similar ways to cytotoxic T cells of the
        adaptive immune system, but do not require activation
        and respond rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="basic-steps-of-the-normal-immune-responses">Basic steps of the normal immune responses</h1>
<p><strong>Natural killer cells</strong> recognise infected or malignant
    host cells or foreign cells by a lack of MHC-I proteins expressed
    on their surfaces, or by the presence of foreign antigens.
    Normal healthy cells present enough MHC-I protein to inhibit
    natural killer cells. If sufficiently stimulated by a lack
    of MHC-I protein or by presence of foreign antigen, the natural
    killer cells proceed to kill the identified unwanted cell
    (Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Rapid action by natural killer
        cells after stimulation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The identification of infected and malignant cells based on reduced
    levels of MHC-I proteins and the subsequent rapid elimination
    of such unwanted cells by natural killer cells makes this
    response an important natural defence mechanism against malignancies.
    The non-specific, rapid response of natural killer cells
    differs from the response of T cells in that T cells first
    need to recognise a specific antigen, in order to provide
    a specific immune response.</p>
<p><strong>B cells</strong>, as part of their role in the adaptive
    immune system and specialising in providing the humoral immune
    response, carry out different modes of action (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The main modes of action by B
        cells. Top: recognition of a foreign antigen, triggering
        cloning and release of antibodies in response; bottom:
        recognition of a foreign antibody on an infected cell,
        leading to formation of a MHC-II complex (ready to present
        to helper T cells, see below).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Individual B cells carry random membrane-bound antibodies on
    their surface. When one encounters a complementary foreign
    antigen, or when activated by T cells, the B cell clones
    itself. Most of these clones are effectors that release free
    antibodies to attract phagocytes (a type of cell that is
    able to engulf and digest harmful particles and cells; see
    below), but some are memory cells. Memory cells are long-lived
    B cells that maintain the ability to provide a specific immune
    response to a particular antigen long after the first encounter.
    B cells can also respond to infected cells; these cells present
    foreign antigens on their MHC-I protein. When B cells encounter
    them, they internalise the foreign antigens and present them
    in an MHC-II complex, ready for recognition and action by
    helper T cells (see below).</p>
<p><strong>T cells</strong>, as part of their role in the adaptive
    immune system and specialising in providing the immune response
    dealing with infected cells, also carry out different modes
    of action (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The main modes of action by B
        cells. Top: cytotoxic T cell binds to MHC-I complex of
        an infected cell, triggering cell death; bottom: helper
        T cell binds to MHC-II complex, releasing cytokines and
        activating more B cells and cytotoxic T cells.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cytotoxic T cells kill infected cells by releasing toxic chemicals
    once activated by binding to the MHC-I complex of an infected
    cell. Helper T cells are fundamental across all activities
    of the adaptive immune system. They bind to MHC-II complexes
    of infected cells and release cytokines. These chemical messenger
    proteins initiate the activation of antibody production in
    B cells, have a role in activating cytotoxic T cells, and
    help to attract macrophages to engulf and remove harmful
    particles.</p>
<p><strong>Phagocytes</strong> are another part of the innate immune
    system. They are specialised cells that can be found everywhere
    in the body, able to engulf and digest harmful particles
    (phagocytosis) and to provide a rapid response. The most
    common type of phagocyte in humans are neutrophils, which
    circulate in the bloodstream and are early responders. Macrophages
    are another type of white blood cell found almost everywhere
    in the body; these cells are the ultimate scavengers and
    specialise in cleaning up dead cells and other cell debris.</p>
<h1 id="strategies-to-exploit-the-immune-system-for-therapy-of-malignancies">Strategies to exploit the immune system for therapy of malignancies</h1>
<p>A number of different strategies to exploit the immune system
    in combatting malignancies hold promise for future clinical
    use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>monoclonal antibodies;</li>
    <li>checkpoint inhibitors;</li>
    <li>adoptive cell transfer;</li>
    <li>iNKT cells;</li>
    <li>vaccines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all strategies will work across the range of malignant diseases.
    For example, head &amp; neck malignancies typically show
    strong immunosuppressive properties, different from most
    other malignancies. Attempts at interfering with the complex
    immune system are also likely to be plagued by unintended,
    <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/immunotherapies/detailed">serious adverse effects</a>.
    Another hurdle currently is the difficulty in predicting
    who will benefit from which treatment approaches, as there
    have not yet been reliable biomarkers identified for purposes
    of evaluation of treatment success and failure. This is a
    significant aspect for providing meaningful and helpful immunotherapies.
    Typical criteria to assess the ongoing treatment with conventional
    therapies, for example chemo- or radiotherapy will look at
    say, tumour shrinkage as a measure of success and effective
    treatment (whereas surgery will only regard complete excision
    with a pre-defined margin of normal tissue as ‘success’).
    That will typically not work easily in immunotherapies because
    the paths and timelines of reaction to treatment will be
    different from those in conventional treatment schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Monoclonal antibodies</strong> work by mimicking natural
    antibodies, meaning that they support the immune system and
    that there can be many different types of monoclonal antibodies.
    However, they must have a specific target, such as a specific
    antigen, which they can bind to. Each monoclonal antibody
    will only effectively interact with one specific target (Figure
    5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Antibody-dependent cell mediated
        cytotoxicity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main mode of action for cancer treatment by means of monoclonal
    antibodies involves the design of monoclonal antibodies that
    can bind to particular tumour antigens to form a complex.
    This complex is recognised by an immune effector cell (such
    as a natural killer cell) which binds its Fc receptor to
    the Fc domain of the antibody; this binding causes tumour
    cell death (the Fc receptor is common protein motif on the
    surface of many cells involves in the immune system; the
    Fc surface domain specifically binds to complexes such as
    the one made up of a monoclonal antibody and a malignant
    cell). This process is called antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity.</p>
<p>Figure 6 schematically depicts another possible mechanism which
    does not involve the immune system, complement-dependent
    cytotoxicity.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Complement-dependent cytotoxicity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In complement-dependent cytotoxicity, a complement protein binds
    to the monoclonal antibody-tumour antigen complex, triggering
    a cascade of complement proteins that results in the formation
    of a pore on the cell surface (the membrane attack complex),
    so causing cell lysis (dissolution of the cell).</p>
<p>Monoclonal antibodies could also be attached to a non-toxic drug,
    which then guides them to the tumour antigen where the drug
    is subsequently converted (by the antibody) to the cytotoxic
    drug. This strategy may be useful to reduce the systemic
    toxicity of cytotoxic drugs in general.</p>
<p>A monoclonal antibody drug that has been approved for use in
    treating head and neck cancers is cetuximab. It targets the
    epidermal growth factor receptor, which when stimulated leads
    to cell growth. The epidermal growth factor is overexpressed
    in many malignancies. Cetuximab binds to the epidermal growth
    factor receptor with a higher affinity than the normal epidermal
    growth factor proteins, so blocks them from binding and therefore
    slows tumour cell production.</p>
<p>Other monoclonal antibody drugs that have shown promise but that
    are not yet used for treating head and neck malignancies
    (and may not be suitable anyway), are panitumumab, trastuzumab,
    and rituximab.</p>
<p><strong>Checkpoint inhibitors</strong> can be considered as a
    form of monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p>The immune system has mechanisms for turning off T cells, inhibitory
    checkpoints, that ensure that the immune system does not
    deliver an autoimmune response. Checkpoints normally switch
    on and off the T cell proteins as required for an adequate
    immune response. However, many malignancies produce large
    amounts of the ‘on’ protein for an inhibitory checkpoint,
    meaning that T cells are inhibited and will not attack the
    malignant cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs disrupt these
    signals sent by malignant cells and therefore expose them
    to an immune response (Figure 7).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Binding of CD28 stimulates the
        binding of CTLA-4, which then inhibits the T cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CTLA-4 is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor, found on newly activated
    and regulatory T cells, along with the stimulatory receptor
    CD28. The binding of CD28 to ligands on an antigen-presenting
    cell stimulates CTLA-4. CTLA-4 has greater affinity for binding
    to the ligands than CD28, so the T cells are inhibited. Ipilimumab
    is a drug that binds to CTLA-4 so blocks tumour-produced
    proteins from binding, therefore allowing an enhanced immune
    response. Ipilimumab has been used with some success in the
    treatment of metastatic <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">melanoma</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level2-figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> The binding of the PD-1 receptor
        on a T cell to PD-L1 on a tumour cell (or PD-L2 on an
        antigen-presenting cell) inhibits the T cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another inhibitory receptor is PD-1, which is expressed on activated
    T cells. It is activated by the PD-L2 ligand found on antigen-presenting
    cells, and the PD-L1 ligand which is found on various cells
    types (Figure 8). Importantly, it is upregulated on many
    malignant cells, meaning that malignant cells can use the
    inhibitory interaction as a method to evade an immune response.
    Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are drugs that inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1
    pathway. These drugs have been used to treat metastatic melanoma
    which meets specific marker criteria, but not as a primary
    treatment. Oral mucosal melanoma is treated surgically, although
    if it recurs or spreads, a systemic approach may be viable.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of <strong>adoptive cell transfer</strong>    is to transfer tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes with anti-malignancy
    activity to a patient. The lymphocytes originate from the
    patient themselves. The lymphocytes are extracted from the
    tumour cells, the tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes that show
    the highest affinity for the malignant cells are isolated,
    this population is expanded and then re-injected.</p>
<p>One of the main forms of adoptive cell transfer is chimeric antigen
    receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which involves gene modification.
    T cells are removed (apheresis) and isolated, then altered
    to CAR T cells by inserting the CAR gene, so that they can
    then recognise and target proteins on malignant cells more
    effectively than normal T cells. For this treatment to be
    most effective, the target antigen should be uniformly expressed
    on the tumour cells, but not on healthy cells. Adoptive cell
    transfer is a fairly new approach. For example, in the UK
    it was approved in 2018 for the treatment of some forms of
    childhood leukaemia and lymphoma in adults. For the time
    being, adoptive cell transfer treatment schemes have a number
    of serious adverse effects (cytokine release syndrome), including
    neurotoxicity.</p>
<p>Invariant natural killer T cells (<strong>iNKT cells</strong>)
    are a subset of innate-like T cells that recognise non-peptide
    antigens presented on the CD1-d protein. They are some of
    the first cells activated in an immune response and could
    be important in regulating the immune response to malignancies
    as well as to antigens. This is thought to be another promising
    avenue for further research. It has been demonstrated that
    the number of these cells is reduced in many cancer patients
    and this finding is correlated with overall survival rates.
    It is thought that lower numbers of iNKT cells indicate defects
    in the immune response.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccines</strong> represent an area of much ongoing research.
    There are many different types of vaccine being looked into
    as they all have different targets, but the general aim is
    to stimulate or restore an immune response against malignancies.
    A promising area of research is their application as a therapeutic
    measure, aiming at delaying tumour growth and possibly achieve
    shrinkage. Sipuleucel-T is a therapeutic vaccine that was
    approved in the US for the treatment of prostate cancer in
    2010; it is not approved in the UK and the evidence base
    for its effectiveness is slim. Some isolated spectacular
    initial responses have been seen in trials in head and neck
    cancer but none have demonstrated a long term benefit.</p>
<p>A more traditional view to, and application of, vaccines, to
    prevent some viral infections, is relevant in a maxillofacial
    surgery context. The human papilloma virus (HPV) is known
    to have some high-risk strands that are associated with causing
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oropharyngeal malignancies</a>    (amongst other malignancies).</p>
<p>Whilst vaccination against HPV infections (especially the high-risk
    strands 16 and 18; plus strands 6 and 11) is not a therapy
    to treat oropharyngeal cancers, this vaccination can prevent
    the development of these malignancies in the first place
    very effectively. The majority of HPV related malignancies
    afflict women (a leading cause of cervical cancer), so the
    initial vaccination schemes were only offered to girls. It
    is to be welcomed that in many countries these schemes have
    been modified and are now offered to boys and girls. Not
    only is this prevention by vaccination for all cheaper than
    the treatment costs in the absence of such vaccination schemes
    – HPV vaccination also prevents much suffering.</p>
