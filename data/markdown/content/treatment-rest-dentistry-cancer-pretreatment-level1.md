<p>It may come as a surprise to some people, newly diagnosed
    with a malignancy (and not only head and neck
    malignancies), that the first step in their treatment
    scheme should be a visit to a dental clinic and to see a
    dental hygienist. It is best practice that all who are
    about to start systemic <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>
    treatment schemes, <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>
    applied to the head and neck region, and ahead of <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer">major oral
        and maxillofacial surgery interventions</a> should
    be seen in such a clinic as a first step.</p>
<p>The purpose of this first step is to optimise oral health
    ahead of treatment, and thus to minimise any later
    complications arising from dental problems during or
    after treatment. The two components in this process are
    to carry out any necessary dental work ahead of
    treatment, and to establish a good regimen of self-care
    and daily oral hygiene.</p>
<h2>Dental status and interventions</h2>
<p>It is crucial to understand at this stage that the normal
    highly prevention orientated mindset of dental
    professionals (very much a give it a chance and see what
    happens with minor and even major potential dental
    interventions) is completely inappropriate under these
    circumstances. This is most true of someone undergoing
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">chemo/radiotherapy</a>
    of the head and neck region. This is not simply because
    of the acute-phase <a href="/treatment/surgery/oral-mucosal-lesions/detailed">mucositis</a>
    (painful mouth ulcers; this will be experienced by those
    receiving most forms of systemic chemotherapy) and the
    need to avoid developing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">infections</a>
    in the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immunosuppressed</a>,
    or performing even minor surgery in someone with no <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">platelets</a>.
    These are important considerations but understanding the
    nature of the permanent damage done to salivary glands
    and bone at a cellular level is essential. Teeth of
    dubious prognosis which may otherwise be preserved could
    become a threat to life, <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal
        disease</a> which could be lived with if regular
    treatment was continued can result in crippling <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis</a>.
    This paradigm shift is essential in the oral and dental
    care of those undergoing non-surgical oncological
    intervention. When patients are undergoing surgical
    treatment for head and neck cancer, the oral and
    maxillofacial surgical oncologist can easily include
    tooth removal as part of the process but <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-post-treatment">long-term
        optimisation and dental care</a> is not part of that
    process and needs to be provided by a restorative
    dentist and/or hygienist trained in this area.  </p>
<h2>Oral hygiene</h2>
<p>Prior to beginning treatment, getting into good habits in
    terms of daily oral hygiene practices is highly
    recommended. Maintaining good oral health during and
    after treatment has positive effects on treatment
    outcomes. Effective tooth brushing, interdental
    cleaning, and finding motivation are important for all
    people at all times. But ‘getting into the habit’,
    adopting and practicing good oral hygiene techniques are
    important to be established early, so that it is easier
    to maintain such good habits <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-post-treatment">during
        and after treatment</a>. Oral hygiene specialists
    are well placed to provide not only a thorough
    professional clean, but also to give advice about good
    techniques at home.</p>
