<p>The term dysphagia refers to all kinds of swallowing problems.
    Swallowing problems range from minor disturbances all the
    way to complete inability to swallow. The problems can be
    temporary on a short time scale, can last for a considerable
    period of time or may be permanent.</p>
<p>Difficulties with swallowing can be a symptom or a consequence
    of disease, or may arise as a consequence of treatments.
    Swallowing problems are as widely varied as the underlying
    causes. Some swallowing problems are not immediately obvious,
    some have very clear symptoms.</p>
<p>Depending on the severity and duration of swallowing problems,
    a number of additional health issues can arise. It is therefore
    important to <a href="/help/salt">assess any swallowing problems</a>.</p>
<p>Even those with rather serious difficulties with swallowing can
    often safely eat and/or drink by <a href="/help/oral-food">adjusting the food offered</a>    to suitable textures and temperatures as well as avoiding
    some unsuitable foods altogether. Sometimes <a href="/help/salt">special tricks and postures</a>    can help with swallowing. In a few particularly serious circumstances
    oral food intake may be impossible, either temporarily or
    permanently, and <a href="/help/non-oral-food">alternative ways of feeding</a>    will then be needed.</p>
