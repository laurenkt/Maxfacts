<p>Chemoradiation (combining chemotherapy with <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>)
    in head and neck cancer improved the outcome for nasopharyngeal
    cancer and some poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
    with the additional benefit of organ preservation.</p>
<p>Recent meta-analysis of studies had shown improved loco-regional
    control with survival improved by some 8-15% depending on
    the study (both the <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/further-reading">EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) and RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) groups</a>    have produced convincing data). However, the combination
    of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is associated with increased
    morbidity and mortality. All the studies failed to contain
    a surgical control arm and none identified or excluded patients
    who were non-smokers with HPV driven cancers.</p>
<p>Currently we are seeing the consequences of the widespread application
    of these hyper-radical treatment regimens, and in some cases
    quite devastating long term morbidity on the survivors. Its
    continued use will need appropriate cases and almost certainly
    will not include those cases which are relatively low risk
    (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">HPV driven</a>)
    or equally treatable using surgery as a single modality.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy by itself has a useful role in <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care">palliation</a>    in some instances.</p>
