<p>Cysts occur in all parts of the body but are a prominent topic
    in a maxillofacial context: cysts are one of the most common
    reasons for people to attend a maxillofacial clinic. In particular
    cysts in the jaws are common. These cysts often are remnants
    of the complicated embryonal developmental processes involved
    in the emergence of jaws and teeth from immature cells in
    a foetus (developmental cysts).</p>
<p>Much is known about embryonal developmental processes in general
    but not all details about the origins of cysts are entirely
    clear. Also, there appear to be a number of different mechanisms
    by which cysts grow. Especially some of the biochemical growth
    mechanisms have recently been investigated in detail.</p>
<p>Here we give a brief summary of origins and growth of epithelial
    cysts of the jaws, along with some comments about diagnostic
    steps and histological findings. Beyond this brief summary,
    there is a large (and growing) <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">body of literature</a>    concerned with properties of epithelial cysts.</p>

<p>These figures can vary a little; for example keratocysts seem
    twice as common in German-speaking countries than the UK.</p>
<p>There are several theories proposed for mechanisms supporting
    the growth of epithelial cysts:</p>
<p><strong>Hydrostatic theory</strong> - central epithelial necrosis
    results in a hyperosmolar cyst fluid, leading to high osmotic
    pressure and causing fluid from surrounding tissues to move
    into the cavity. This mechanism depends on the type (and
    thickness) of epithelial lining of the cyst. Most cysts are
    roughly spherically shaped, fluid-filled cavities, strongly
    suggesting that some non-directional force, such as hydrostatic
    pressure plays a role in growth. The increase in hydrostatic
    pressure resulting from fluid influx into the cavity is thought
    to cause (or contribute to) expansion of bone.</p>
<p><strong>Proliferation of lining theory</strong> - toxic products
    of necrotic pulp or bacteria lead to degeneration and liquefaction
    necrosis of granulation tissue. The epithelium then proliferates
    to surround the area. The exact biochemistry underlying this
    mechanism is not yet fully understood.</p>
<p><strong>Prostaglandin theory</strong> - epithelial cells within
    the lining produce prostaglandin release in response to some
    stimulus. The prostaglandins (and/or other bone-resorbing
    factors) cause bone resorption, thus resulting in expansion
    of the cavity. It is thought that the increased bone resorption
    is caused by stimulation of osteoclast formation.</p>
<h1 id="special-diagnostic-investigations">Special diagnostic investigations</h1>
<p>These are specific tests carried out to help reach a diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Radiography</strong> - this is an essential investigation
    for establishing the outline extent of the lesion. It also
    shows the relationship of teeth and associated anatomical
    structures such as the inferior dental nerve. Cone beam
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a> (allowing three-dimensional image reconstruction)
        can provide a more detailed picture to aid diagnosis
        or associated structures in relevant cases.</p>
<p><strong>Aspiration</strong> - this can be helpful in establishing
    a diagnosis:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cheesy white material suggests a keratocyst</li>
    <li>solid mass suggests possible tumour or very thick keratin
        mass</li>
    <li>pus indicates an infected cyst or abscess (also foul smell)</li>
    <li>blood can suggest either an aneurysmal bone cyst or, more
        importantly, a vascular malformation</li>
    <li>air indicates that the needle is within the maxillary antrum
        or it indicates a solitary bone cyst</li>
</ul>
<p>Various tests can be carried out on the aspirate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>culture and sensitivity - if infection is suspected</li>
    <li>stain for keratin - keratinised squames are suggestive of
        a keratocyst</li>
    <li>soluble protein content - keratocysts have low soluble protein
        content because the cyst is filled with keratin, which
        is mostly insoluble protein. The aspirate therefore contains
        less than 4g/dl soluble protein. Cysts and tumours generally
        have soluble protein concentrations greater than 5g/dl</li>
    <li>electrophoresis - not often used nowadays but the protein
        bands are compared with normal serum as a control. Electrophoresis
        can indicate keratocysts because the keratin has little
        soluble protein compared with serum</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incisional biopsy</strong> - if a lesion is very large
    or if there is suspicion of it being more than a simple cyst
    (for example, a keratocyst or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">ameloblastoma</a>),
    then a biopsy is indicated.</p>
<h1 id="histological-features">Histological features</h1>
<h2>Histological features of odontogenic cysts</h2>
<p><strong>Radicular cysts (inflammatory)</strong> - these cysts
    develop within a periapical granuloma. The epithelial lining
    is nonkeratinised squamous epithelium and it is hyperplastic
    with occasional mucous metaplasia. Rushton bodies (peculiar
    glassy structures) may be found in about 10% of odontogenic
    cysts, and they only occur in odontogenic cysts because the
    material is only secreted by reduced enamel epithelium. Cholesterol
    clefts are often present in inflammatory cysts but are not
    diagnostic. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils,
    lymphocytes and plasma cells is present.</p>
<p><strong>Dentigerous cysts (developmental)</strong> - these cysts
    are attached to the unerupted tooth at the amelocemental
    junction, and although this cannot be seen radiographically,
    it can be seen at operation. The epithelial lining, which
    is derived from the reduced enamel epithelium has a flat
    basement membrane and is a feature of developmental cysts
    (dentigerous cysts and keratocysts). If the cyst is infected
    there will be an inflammatory response, similar to a radicular
    cyst.</p>
<p><strong>Keratocysts (developmental)</strong> - the epithelial
    lining in keratocysts is very friable and therefore difficult
    to remove completely. Microscopic ‘satellite’ cysts can be
    left behind at operation and this creates the problem of
    recurrence. The epithelium is keratinised and the keratin
    is shed into the lumen of the cyst producing the characteristic
    cheesy contents (see Figure 2). The basement membrane is
    flat as in a dentigerous cyst with palisaded columnar basal
    cells.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The cheesy, sebaceous-like contents
        seen in a ruptured keratocyst.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Histological features of nonodontogenic cysts</h2>
<p><strong>Nasopalatine duct cysts (developmental)</strong> – the
    epithelial lining of these cysts is variable among respiratory,
    columnar, cuboidal and squamous epithelium as it approaches
    the oral cavity. The specimen may contain the neurovascular
    bundle.</p>
