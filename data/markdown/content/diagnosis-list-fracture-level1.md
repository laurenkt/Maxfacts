<p>It may come as a surprise but there really is no difference between
    a “fracture” and a broken bone. The big difference comes
    whether a fracture is displaced (see Figure 1 for a sketch
    of a displaced fracture) – which means it is out of alignment
    and needs to be returned to its previous position and held
    there. This operation is called <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">reduction and fixation</a>.</p>

<p>If the break is exposed to the outside world through the skin,
    or mucosal lining of the mouth, or the periodontal ligament
    around teeth then it is called compound and is more likely
    to become infected. The operation should then be carried
    out sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>If the break is in multiple pieces it is called “comminuted”
    and is often more difficult to treat.</p>
<p>In maxillofacial surgery we deal with the relatively simple skull
    bones and the massively complex facial bones. Conventionally
    the face is divided into 1/3rds, upper, middle and lower.
    The lower is the mandible (bottom jaw) which is broken regularly
    in isolation as a consequence of intoxicated fighting. The
    mandible supports the airway and loss of this support is
    the major risk in severe injuries.</p>
<p>The midface is a complex structure of quite fragile bones supported
    by vertical pillars and prominent cheekbones (called zygomas
    or “malars” in the trade). Their main purpose is to protect
    the eyes and fractures can range from quite simple to extremely
    complex.</p>
<p>The upper third is the frontal bone and its attachments which
    is really there to protect the brain. Fractures are less
    common, although fractures of the bones making up the frontal
    sinus deserve special attention and are a little <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">controversial in terms of treatment</a>.</p>
