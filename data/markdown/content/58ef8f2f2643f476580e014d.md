<p>Fractures are caused by accidents and trauma in general. Trauma
    is a leading cause of death and disability particularly in
    the young. One of the real advances in health care over the
    last 25 years has been the standardised approach to severe
    trauma, originally modelled on the American College of Surgeons
    Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles. While there
    are some variations worldwide, this system allows everyone
    who has been trained in it to ‘speak the same language’ in
    establishing priorities in both identifying and simultaneously
    treating acute life threating injuries.</p>
<p>For that reason this section first concentrates on that general
    trauma-care system. Later on we describe some of the specialist
    techniques in maxillofacial trauma that are either adjuncts
    to ATLS or relevant to maxillofacial trauma in the acute
    setting (much of it can be handled semi-urgently).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about specific fracture repair,
        this information is on our detailed pages about the
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed">treatment of fractures</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="principles-of-trauma-care-advanced-trauma-life-support-atls">Principles of trauma care (Advanced Trauma Life Support, ATLS)</h1>
<p>Modern trauma resuscitation is based on the Advanced Trauma Life
    Support course for doctors (<a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">ATLS</a>),
    devised and updated by the American College of Surgeons Committee
    on Trauma. This system has established an accepted international
    reputation as the gold standard for trauma resuscitation.</p>
<p>It follows a logical sequence of care which is designed to maximise
    the efficiency of assessment of the trauma victim, as well
    as provide priority ranking of potential, life threatening
    problems and simultaneous resuscitative interventions. The
    sequence of ATLS is as follows:</p>
<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>
<p>This is divided into a <i>pre-hospital phase</i> essentially
    limited to first aid in the field of injury. A matching system
    for paramedics and field physicians exists (Pre-Hospital
    Trauma Life Support; PHTLS). Triage, which is a sorting of
    patients based on the urgency of need of treatment and the
    available resources to provide that treatment, may be carried
    out both pre-hospital or in hospital. This is based on the
    principle that the most severely injured patient requires
    the more urgent treatment, and the less injured patient can
    receive treatment after a slight delay using the ABC’s described
    below.</p>
<p>The second phase of preparation is the <i>in-hospital phase</i>    in which the patient has been brought to the hospital where
    he/she can be managed according to the extent of injury.</p>
<h2>Primary survey</h2>
<p>This is the rapid but thorough assessment of patient treatment
    priorities based on their injuries, their vital signs and
    the injury mechanism. It follows the ABC's of trauma
    care and identifies life-threatening conditions by adhering
    to the sequence:</p>
<p><strong>A         -          </strong> Airway maintenance with
    cervical spine protection.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>         -           Breathing and ventilation
    with maximum flow oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>C        </strong> -           Circulation with haemorrhage
    control.</p>
<p><strong>D        </strong> -           Disability; neurological
    status assessment.</p>
<p><strong>E        </strong> -           Exposure/environment control,
    completely undressed patient but hypothermia prevented.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> – Airway maintenance with cervical spine protection</p>
<p>After ensuring personal safety, the airway is assessed by looking,
    listening and feeling for air movement. Grunting, snoring
    or absence of breath indicates an obstructed airway. Talking,
    swearing or screaming, conversely indicates a patent airway.
    This rapid assessment should include inspection for foreign
    bodies and facial, mandibular or tracheal/laryngeal fractures
    that may result in airway obstruction.</p>
<p>Measures to establish a patent airway, if needed, should be instituted
    while protecting the cervical spine (loss of airway kills
    fastest but creating a quadriplegic in the process does not
    help the patient). Initially manually clearing the airway
    and the chin lift or jaw thrust manoeuvre (see below) is
    recommended, and may be reinforced in the unconscious patient
    with an oral airway or, in the rousable patient, a nasopharyngeal
    airway. These airway adjuncts do not secure the airway (that
    requires a secured, cuffed tube in the trachea) but may be
    adequate until a secure airway can be safely achieved by
    nasal, oral or surgical intubation. A reduced level of consciousness
    or blunt injury above the clavicle (collar bone), in a polytrauma
    patient (a patient with multiple injuries) carries a 10%
    risk of cervical spine injury. Immobilisation in the neutral
    position minimises the risk of further morbidity.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> – Breathing and ventilation</p>
<p>Airway patency alone does not ensure adequate ventilation: adequate
    gas exchange is required to maximise blood oxygenation and
    carbon dioxide elimination.  Ventilation requires adequate
    function of the lungs, chest wall and diaphragm.  Each component
    must be examined and evaluated rapidly.  If the patient is
    not breathing adequately, immediately remediable problems
    e.g. tension pneumothorax (collapsed lung), displaced tube
    or cardiac tamponade are addressed. If there is no effort
    or adequate effort at self-ventilation then manual or mechanical
    ventilation must be started. High flow oxygen needs to be
    given in any case (with reservoir bag if by facemask).</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> – Circulation with haemorrhage control</p>
<p>Obvious external bleeding is stopped by direct pressure. Two
    wide-bore intravenous cannulae are established, to take blood
    and give a fluid challenge (2 litres of warmed Hartmann’s
    solution (solution of sodium, potassium and calcium chloride,
    plus sodium lactate). Ringer’s solution (sodium lactate solution)
    and normal saline (sodium chloride solution) are more commonly
    quoted than Hartmann’s in the US).</p>
<p>Pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure are monitored. All
    trauma shock is initially managed as haemorrhagic shock until
    proven otherwise. Possible bleeding in the chest, abdomen
    and pelvis are explored. In the case of maxillofacial trauma,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed">fractures of the midface (Le Fort I, II and III)</a>    can lead to torrential haemorrhage and, rarely, immediate
    specialist maxillofacial resuscitation is needed (see below).</p>
<p>Despite the evidence, particularly from recent warfare experiences
    and in common use in UK emergency departments, giving tranexamic
    acid (medication to stop or prevent bleeding) as an infusion
    has not yet translated into ATLS protocols.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> – Disability and neurological evaluation</p>
<p>A rapid neurological evaluation is performed to assess the patient's
    level of consciousness, pupillary size and reaction. The
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">Glasgow Coma Score</a>     is the international gold standard.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> -   Exposure/environment control</p>
<p>Special effort must be made to avoid the patient developing hypothermia
    during the early stages of trauma care. Exposure (removing
    clothing to ensure no other injury is missed) is carried
    out in a warmed environment.</p>
<h2>Secondary survey</h2>
<p>This does not begin until the primary survey (ABCDE) is completed,
    resuscitation has been successful, and the patient is demonstrating
    normalisation of vital functions.  It is essentially a head
    to toe evaluation which looks at head injury, cervical spine
    and neck injury, chest injury, abdominal injury, perineum
    and rectal/vaginal injury, musculoskeletal injury, peripheral
    neurological injury and also maxillofacial injury. Assessment
    of maxillofacial trauma is part of the secondary survey when
    it is not compromising the airway or leading to significant
    haemorrhage. If the maxillofacial trauma is compromising
    the patient’s airway or causing significant haemorrhage,
    then this is noted in the primary survey and acted upon.
    Many lives have been saved by health care workers who have
    stuck rigidly to this tried and tested methodology.</p>
<h1 id="specialist-maxillofacial-resuscitative-techniques">Specialist maxillofacial resuscitative techniques</h1>
<p>This is initially based on airway preservation and adequate ventilation
    in order to maintain oxygenation and prevent hypoxia (decreased
    partial pressure of oxygen) and hypercarbia (increased partial
    pressure of carbon dioxide). These factors are critical in
    managing the trauma patient, especially if a head injury
    has been sustained.  Maxillofacial trauma demands aggressive
    airway management.  High impact trauma to the mid face produces
    fractures with displacement and oedema which will obstruct
    the nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx.  Facial fractures
    may be associated with haemorrhage, increased secretions
    and dislodged teeth causing additional problems in maintaining
    a patent airway.  Fractures of the mandible, especially bilateral
    body fractures may cause loss of normal tongue support, leading
    to the tongue falling backwards and blocking the airway.
    Airway obstruction can also result as post-traumatic oedema
    develops rapidly. The problem can be exacerbated if the patient
    is in a supine position (lying on the back; the position
    favoured in ATLS resuscitation) because secretions, blood
    and the abnormally heavy tongue can fall to the back of the
    mouth.</p>
<p>A patient’s refusal to lie down may be demonstrating difficulty
    in maintaining their airway or handling secretions. This
    should not be presumed to be uncooperative in the first instance.
    This creates a dichotomy between allowing the patient to
    maintain their own airway in an upright position and securing
    the airway in the supine position. Common sense, in conjunction
    with clinical judgement and proceeding are the solution.</p>
<h2>Airway maintenance techniques</h2>
<p>Even in non-trauma patients with decreased consciousness the
    tongue may fall backwards and obstruct the hypopharynx. This
    form of obstruction can be corrected by a <i>chin lift</i>    or <i>jaw thrust</i> manoeuvre.  The airway can then be maintained
    with an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway. These manoeuvres
    must always be done with in-line immobilisation of the cervical
    spine if the cervical spine has not yet been cleared of any
    injury by clinical and radiological methods and an appropriately
    trained individual.</p>
<p><strong>Chin lift</strong>: the fingers of one hand are placed
    under the mandible which is gently lifted upward to bring
    the chin forward, while the thumb of the same hand lightly
    depresses the lower lip to open the mouth. The thumb may
    be placed behind the lower incisors to help pull the chin
    forward.  The chin lift manoeuvre should not hyperextend
    the neck. This manoeuvre is useful for the trauma victim
    because it does not risk compromising a possible cervical
    spine fracture or converting a fracture without cord injury
    into one with cord injury.</p>
<p><strong>Jaw thrust manoeuvre</strong>: this is performed by grasping
    the angle of the mandible, one hand on each side and displacing
    the mandible forward.  When this method is used with the
    facemask or an anaesthetic bag valve device, a good seal
    and adequate ventilation can be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>Oropharyngeal airway</strong>: an oral airway is inserted
    into the mouth behind the tongue.  The preferred technique
    is to insert the tube upside down and then rotate it over
    the back of the tongue. The device lifts the tongue forward
    off the hypopharynx and allows air to pass through the lumen
    of the oropharyngeal airway.</p>
<p><strong>Nasopharyngeal airway</strong>: this is inserted into
    one nostril and passed into the posterior nasopharynx. Beware
    obstruction of this (or any) tube (see Figure 1). This airway
    is better tolerated in the conscious patient.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info/figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Beware the unexpected: nasopharyngeal
        airways and endotracheal tubes can become occluded.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Needle cricothyroidotomy</strong>: there are common misconceptions
    about this technique. It does NOT secure the airway. It does
    maintain some form of airway which can allow insufflation
    of the lungs and preserve life for about 30 mins, until a
    secure airway (below) is achieved. It is performed by inserting
    a wide bore intravenous cannula (12 or 14 gauge) through
    the cricothyroid membrane (above cricoid cartilage and below
    thyroid cartilage). Aspiration confirms if it is in the trachea.
    It is next connected to oxygen at 12-15 L/min via a Y connector
    or by cutting a hole in the tubing. Occluding the hole for
    1 sec allows to “inflate” the lung, then turning the oxygen
    off for 4 sec allows the lung to deflate.</p>
<p>These are all merely temporary airway maintenance techniques
    and do not represent a definitive airway. A secure airway
    has not been obtained until an endo-tracheal tube has been
    placed with the cuff inflated and the tube secured. The tube
    is connected to some form of high flow oxygen (12-15 L/min).
    If a patient has difficulty in breathing either mechanical
    obstructions (pneumothorax, tamponade) need to be removed
    or assisted ventilation (Ambu bag, ventilator) provided.</p>
<h2>Definitive airways</h2>
<p>These are of three varieties:  orotracheal tube, nasotracheal
    tube, and surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy;
    see Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A secured, definitive surgical
        airway – a cuffed tube in the trachea.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A definitive airway is required if the patient is going to undergo
    surgical correction of facial fractures and have treatment
    of other associated injuries. It is also indicated if the
    patient is destined to spend a long time recovering from
    head injury, or requires a prolonged period of artificial
    ventilation in an intensive care unit. Orotracheal and nasotracheal
    intubation are specialised techniques, best performed by
    those trained and experienced in them. Hypoxia can result
    while inexperienced personnel attempt to place these tubes.</p>
<p><strong>Cricothyroidotomy</strong>: this is an emergency procedure
    and can be done in the field, accident and emergency setting,
    or ward setting as long as the surgeon has the ability to
    perform the procedure. This involves making a cut through
    the skin and the cricothyroid membrane and introducing a
    cuffed tracheostomy tube (size 6) into the trachea to allow
    oxygen delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Tracheostomy</strong>: this is not an ‘emergency’ surgical
    airway and should not be done in the acute trauma airway
    emergency setting. It requires controlled operating theatre
    equipment and lighting to ensure a successful procedure.
    It takes longer and involves displacement or incision of
    more structures. Tracheostomy involves incising the skin,
    dissecting fat to expose the strap muscles and separating
    them. The thyroid gland is identified and either displaced
    or the isthmus (part of the thyroid gland) ligated and divided.
    A hole in the trachea in the region of the second to fourth
    cartilaginous rings is created either as a slit (in children)
    or by cutting out a circle of trachea or creating an inferiorly
    based flap (Bjork flap) and passing a tube into the tracheal
    lumen.</p>
<p>End tracheostomy is the stoma created when a laryngectomy is
    performed and is quite different from these temporary airway
    operations.</p>
<h1 id="specific-maxillofacial-emergencies">Specific maxillofacial emergencies</h1>
<h2>Laryngeal injuries</h2>
<p>The larynx is a semi-rigid structure made up of the hyoid and
    several cartilages interconnected by fibrous tissue.  This
    framework is lined by mucosa, which can become grossly swollen
    following injury. In young patients, the larynx is elastic
    and tends to flex and spring back to its normal position
    rather than fracture following traumas. The epiglottis may
    become avulsed. In older patients the cartilages become calcified
    and fractures are more likely. Rarely the trachea can be
    avulsed.  This is usually fatal at the time of injury.</p>
<p>Flow varies according to Poiseuille’s law (flow is proportional
    to the radius of tube to the power of 4), which means that
    only small changes in the radius are necessary to significantly
    affect the flow of air through it. This is seen particularly
    after thermal inhalation where oedema of the whole upper
    respiratory tract results in rapid reductions in airflow.
    Early intubation is often necessary.</p>
<p>Causes of obstruction include:</p>
<p>Blunt injuries</p>
<ul>
    <li>Road traffic accidents.</li>
    <li>Sports (e.g. contact sports, martial arts)</li>
    <li>Assaults</li>
</ul>
<p>Penetrating injuries</p>
<ul>
    <li>Knife wounds</li>
    <li>Firearms</li>
    <li>Shrapnel (including human body parts common with improvised
        explosive dvices or suicide bombs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thermal injuries</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inhalation of smoke, hot air or steam</li>
    <li>Blast injury</li>
</ul>
<p>Clinical features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dyspnoea</li>
    <li>Stridor (high-pitched breathing sound)</li>
    <li>Pain</li>
    <li>Localised tenderness</li>
    <li>Hoarse voice</li>
    <li>Dysphagia</li>
    <li>Surgical emphysema</li>
    <li>Displacement of the larynx</li>
</ul>
<p>Management</p>
<p>Rapid identification is essential as patients can quickly deteriorate
    if the airway is not secured. This is particularly the case
    in burns victims.  With minor injuries, humidified air and
    steroids may be all that is required.  However, these patients
    must be kept under close observation and frequently reassessed.
    Major disruption needs the airway securing.  This can be
    done either by intubation, cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy.
    Surgical repair may be required in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tracheal injuries.</li>
    <li>Laryngeal displacement or disruption.</li>
    <li>Excessive swelling of the laryngeal soft tissues.</li>
    <li>Most cases of surgical emphysema.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vision threatening injuries</h2>
<p>Eye injuries are commonly associated with damage to the upper
    midface; in some studies up to 90% of patients had some form
    of ocular injury.  However, in the vast majority of cases
    these are relatively minor and require no treatment.  The
    term vision threatening injuries refers to those injuries
    which, if untreated, rapidly result in loss of sight. These
    are relatively rare but are reported in up to 10% of patients
    who have had “significant” facial injuries (panfacial injuries,
    high velocity injuries, gunshot wounds).</p>
<p>The three common vision threatening injuries are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Retrobulbar haemorrhage (now considered part of orbital compartment
        syndrome).</li>
    <li>Penetrating ocular injuries.</li>
    <li>Optic nerve compression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnosis is usually straight forward but these can be missed
    in the unconscious or uncooperative patient.  The eye must
    be inspected but care must be taken not to press on the globe
    in case there is a penetrating injury.  Visual-evoked potential
    is an experimental method of evaluating the visual pathways
    which has shown much promise. However, it does not identify
    any specific causes.</p>
<p><strong>Retrobulbar haemorrhage (orbital compartment syndrome caused by bleeding)</strong>:
    Bleeding and gross swelling behind the eye may occur following
    trauma (or surgery) to the orbit, which is effectively a
    rigid, closed “box”, with the globe forming one of its “walls”.
    Any swelling will therefore result in raised pressure behind
    the eye, resulting in compression and spasm of the ciliary
    vessels.  In addition, the eye itself becomes pushed forward
    (proptosed). This combination results in compressive effects
    on the vasa nervorum of the optic nerve, creating direct
    neurological damage which can quickly become irreversible.
    Retrobulbar haemorrhage is rare, with a reported incidence
    of around 0.3%.  It commonly occurs within a few hours of
    the injury, although cases presenting up to five days following
    injury have been reported.</p>
<p>Signs may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proptosis</li>
    <li>Opthalmoplegia</li>
    <li>Chemosis and pain</li>
    <li>Relative afferent papillary defect (RAPD; this can indicate
        either optic nerve or severe retinal disease)</li>
    <li>Papilloedema</li>
    <li>Raised intraocular pressure</li>
    <li>Lack of central retinal artery pulsation</li>
    <li>Pale optic disc (late sign)</li>
    <li>Cherry red macula.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blindness is believed to occur due to spasm of the optic and
    retinal blood supply secondary to a high tamponade pressure,
    the difference between this condition and the “benign” retrobulbar
    bleeding seen in 2% of cataract extractions is thought to
    be due to location and tamponade pressure.</p>
<p>Retrobulbar haemorrhage requires immediate surgical decompression
    if vision is to be restored. This simply involves removal
    of all sutures in the area in operated patients.  In trauma
    patients who have not yet been operated on, an incision around
    the eyelid is made to allow access to the lateral canthal
    ligament (an area of denser fascia). This is incised and
    released to allow blunt dissection, passing behind the periorbita
    to enable decompression of the haematoma.</p>
<p>When unavoidable delays in surgery are present, short term measures
    include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dexamethasone, 8mg intravenously</li>
    <li>Acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, reduces production
        of aqueous humour) 500 mg intravenously and then 1000mg
        orally over 24 hours</li>
    <li>Mannitol 100 ml 20% infusion (doses for standard 70kg adult
        without medical contraindications)</li>
    <li>Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis – this involves division
        of one of the supporting ligaments attaching the eyelids
        to the orbital rim. It can be carried out under local
        anaesthesia. This provides a little “breathing space”
        by allowing the eye to pop forward and reduce the pressure
        in the orbit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optic nerve compression</strong>: displaced fractures
    which involve the orbital apex (panfacial, skull fractures)
    can sometimes press on the optic nerve.  Often those structures
    passing through the superior orbital fissure are also traumatised,
    resulting in the orbital apex syndrome. The management for
    this is controversial and involves either surgical decompression
    or high dose steroids. In cases where there is direct impingement
    of the optic nerve by bone or other penetrating fragments,
    removal of these rarely results in an improvement in visual
    acuity. In cases where there is no identifiable hard tissue,
    surgery can be positively harmful and medical reduction of
    swelling is more appropriate.</p>
<h2>Penetrating Neck Injuries</h2>
<p>These are often very dramatic in appearance, but in many cases
    may miss vital structures.  Penetrating injuries deep to
    the platysma muscle (a superficial muscle in the front of
    the neck) should not be explored under local anaesthesia
    in an emergency room setting.</p>
<p>When assessing patients with neck wounds, the following structures
    need to be considered, depending on the point of entry and
    direction.:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Major vessels (carotid artery, internal jugular vein)</li>
    <li>Lung apex</li>
    <li>Upper airway</li>
    <li>Oesophagus</li>
    <li>Vagus nerve</li>
    <li>Phrenic nerve</li>
    <li>Thyroid gland</li>
</ul>
<p>All penetrating foreign bodies should be left <i>in situ</i>    until the patient is anaesthetised and has secure intravenous
    access.  Surgical removal can be then undertaken in an operating
    theatre. Generally this is by directly reversing the path
    of insertion but with wide visualisation and access to surrounding
    vital structures.</p>
<h2>Specialist maxillofacial techniques for arresting haemorrhage</h2>
<p>There are a small number of cases when exsanguinating haemorrhage
    from facial fractures requires direct intervention in the
    primary survey. It is usually due to bleeding from the nose
    or maxillary fractures.</p>
<p>Nasal bleeding can be dealt with by bilateral anterior and posterior
    nasal packing, using specially designed inflatable catheters
    (Brighton balloons, Epitek catheters, Rapid Rhino) or urinary
    catheters in the postnasal space with a conventional anterior
    nasal packing.</p>
<p>Bleeding from the maxilla can be arrested by manual reduction
    and immobilisation with a conventional dental rubber mouth
    prop.</p>
<p>Temporary splinting of open fractures can be achieved with the
    ‘bridle wire’, which is a direct wire ligature passed around
    teeth on either side of a fracture and tightened by twisting
    clockwise.</p>
