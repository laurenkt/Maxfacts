<p>Postoperative problems affecting the larynx (voice box) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inability to speak. In fact, although the larynx containing
        the vocal cords are required for ‘normal speech’, a variety
        of alternative methods have been devised to overcome
        this by ENT(ear, nose &amp; throat) specialists and speech
        and language therapists (<a href="/help/salt">SALT</a>).</li>
    <li>Becoming a ‘neck breather’ creates obvious risks around water,
        again these can be managed. For example, in some areas
        ‘neck breather’ swimming clubs have been established.</li>
    <li>Lack of filtration and humidification by the nose, mouth
        and naso- and oro-pharynx mean drier and potentially
        dirtier air is breathed in over a much shorter ‘dead
        space’ (the area of the breathing system where oxygen
        can’t be exchanged with red blood cells). This short
        space is advantageous in surgical temporary tracheostomy
        but can be a problem when the tracheostome is permanent
        when a laryngectomy has been carried out.</li>
    <li>In the event of sudden collapse, emergency ‘mouth to mouth’
        resuscitation is fruitless as air must be delivered via
        the tracheostome.</li>
</ul>
