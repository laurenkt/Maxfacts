<p>Dry mouth, also called xerostomia, is a common condition which
    is caused by reduced or completely lacking flow of saliva.
    It often afflicts older people and tends to be caused by
    widely used medications (for example, some antidepressants
    or drugs taken to lower blood pressure) or dehydration. Symptoms
    of conditions impacting the immune system (for example, rheumatoid
    arthritis or Sjögren’s syndrome) include xerostomia. Heavy
    use of alcohol and/or tobacco can cause dry mouth, as can
    problems related to stress or anxiety, or breathing through
    the mouth (snoring). Various conditions affecting the salivary
    glands can cause xerostomia. Particularly severe cases of
    dry mouth occur after <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    of the head and neck region.</p>
<p>Severe xerostomia has a massive impact on the quality of life
    and can cause further health issues. Dry mouth makes <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">chewing, swallowing</a>    and speaking difficult, sometimes impossible. Lack of saliva
    can lead to mouth sores, increased <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">tooth decay and gum disease</a>.
    Dry mouth can lead to <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">altered taste</a>    (coated tongue) and greater risk of oral fungal infections
    (thrush). These effects together often lead to <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">poor nutrition</a>    as well as giving a sense of isolation.</p>
