<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">Trismus</a> is debilitating.
    Treatment is aimed at the cause.</p>
<p>As it can be caused (or made more likely to develop) by several
    different conditions including infections, trauma, surgical
    treatment, dental treatment, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">temporomandibular (jaw) joint disorders</a>,
    radiotherapy, some drugs, congenital conditions and some
    other rare disorders, the treatment may range from advice
    on coping mechanisms to radical surgery.</p>
<p>Transient trismus, where the limited mouth opening is entirely
    or mainly due to the acute phase of the cause will usually
    resolve with the treatment of the cause plus (if needed)
    <a href="/help/physiotherapy">physiotherapy</a>.
    This active movement can range from jaw mobilisation exercises
    to the slightly medieval ‘trismus screw’ (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Chronic trismus, where the limited mouth opening persists months
    after the precipitating cause (if that cause had an acute
    phase and it has been completely treated) has been dealt
    with, or where the trismus is the only sign and symptom of
    the cause (for example a jaw joint disorder), will be best
    managed on a ‘shared care’ basis. This means that the benefits
    of any intervention must be very carefully balanced against
    potential risks or the impact of treatment. While this is
    true in all medical problems, it is particularly important
    in this condition where only a few millimetres of additional
    movement may be considered a success by the individual suffering
    from it and a relative failure by the surgeon, or the other
    way round.  </p>

    relevant indications.</p>
