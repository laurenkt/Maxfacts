<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the upper jaw
    (maxilla) include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pain, discomfort and swelling. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Analgesics</a>,
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">anti-inflammatories and corticosteroids</a>        are the mainstay of treatment. Fixation for fractures.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">Oroantral communication</a>.
        This requires <a href="/treatment/surgery/fistula/more-info">closure</a>,
        possibly including <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction with a flap</a>        for a larger defect.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">Fracture</a> of the maxilla.
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">Reduction and fixation</a>.</li>
    <li>Bleeding from multiple areas leaking into the air sinus and
        creating a nose bleed. Treatment is by packing the nasal
        cavity or by <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy</a>        to seal blood vessel(s).</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>.
        Treatment is similar to the treatment of <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/orbit">postoperative problems affecting the orbit</a>        and/or <a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies">treatment options for nerve damage</a>.</li>
</ul>
