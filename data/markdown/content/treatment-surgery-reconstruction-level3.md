<p>Below we give an overview of matching defect types and sites
    with reconstructive options.</p>
<h1 id="some-general-considerations">Some general considerations</h1>
<p>Reconstructive surgery is based on the firm working principle
    that tumour ablation should never be compromised for the
    sake of reconstruction.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li>defect size, site and tissue character:</li>
    <li>flap characteristics (for example, tissue quality and quantity
        available, pedicle length, vascular reliability including
        vessel calibre), success rate, donor site morbidity and
        complications;</li>
    <li>functional outcome options available (for example, appearance,
        chewing, quality of life, sensation, shoulder function,
        speech, swallowing);</li>
    <li>rehabilitation options (for example, dental implants);</li>
    <li>cost factors and resource requirements;</li>
    <li>a patient’s general health (for example, comorbidities can
        influence reconstructive options);</li>
    <li>a patient’s preference;</li>
    <li>the surgeon’s preference (and expertise);</li>
    <li>alternative options (for example, non-surgical options such
        as an obturator, or no reconstruction).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-reconstructive-ladder">The reconstructive ladder</h1>
<p>With the many <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/getting-started">different reconstructive techniques</a>    available, one useful classification frequently quoted is
    the reconstructive ladder. This ladder starts at the bottom
    rung with the simplest technique, open wound healing, and
    progresses to prefabricated free flaps (or possibly composite
    tissue allotransplantation) at the top:</p>
<p>open wound healing =&gt; primary closure =&gt; graft =&gt; local
    flap =&gt; distant pedicled flap =&gt; distant free flap
    =&gt; prefabricated flaps.</p>
<p>This is a useful concept. It reflects the expertise involved
    and, when linked with consequences of failure, as in ‘snakes
    and ladders’, aptly reflects the ‘height of the fall’ should
    the technique not work. It is important to realise that although
    the more sophisticated technique often has greater benefits,
    it is likely that a higher price will be associated with
    its failure. For example, a free flap is usually an all or
    none phenomenon, and every graft or flap harvested has accompanying
    donor site morbidity.</p>
<p>This field of surgical activities may be the most in need of
    recalling Boyes’ law: ‘The ability to do an operation is
    not an indication’. An even more graphic version of this
    advice from surgeon to surgeon would be: ‘Keep it simple,
    stupid’.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to remind yourself about the many different
        grafts and flaps, this information is on our page about
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">grafts and flaps</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="facial-skin">Facial skin</h1>
<p>Apart from open wound healing and primary closure, skin grafts
    as well as local flaps play an important role in the reconstruction
    of facial skin defects.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read about the role and the working of local
        flaps in the repair of facial skin defects, our section
        about <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">treatment of facial skin cancer</a>        discusses this reconstructive technique in detail.</p>
</aside>
<p>Repair of facial skin defects with local flaps often is a preferred
    option, where possible: local flaps provide excellent tissue
    match and very satisfactory cosmesis. Not all facial skin
    defects can be reconstructed with local flaps, and skin grafts
    (particularly full-thickness grafts) are an alternative solution.</p>
<p>Skin grafts may be the treatment of choice in certain defects,
    but equally they may be the only option because of a lack
    of adjacent tissue or the size of the defect. Three types
    of skin grafts are commonly used: full-thickness, split-thickness
    and composite grafts. The full-thickness skin graft is the
    most useful for facial reconstruction. Commonly used as the
    treatment of choice for the nasal tip and the lower eyelid,
    it is also useful for defects of the nasal alae (see Figure
    1) and the ear, as well as for larger defects of the temple
    and forehead. Suitable donor sites are the postauricular
    (behind the ear) region and the supraclavicular (above the
    collarbone) area of the neck.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Basal cell carcinoma of the nose
        treated by excision and full-thickness skin graft before
        (left), during (middle) and after (right) long-term results
        of healing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The perichondrial cutaneous graft is more substantial and three-dimensionally
    stable than normal full-thickness skin grafts. It is harvested
    from the conchal bowl of the ear by taking both skin and
    perichondrium for grafting of the nose or eyelids. This donor
    site defect is reconstructed with an island flap (‘flip flop
    flap’) from the postauricular sulcus.</p>
<p>Split-thickness grafts are harvested from the inner thigh (see
    Figure 2) or arm either manually or with an electric dermatome.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Harvesting a split-thickness graft
        from the thigh.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Split-thickness grafts are useful for large defects, particularly
    of the scalp (see Figure 3). Because these grafts allow more
    contraction than full-thickness grafts, they must be used
    with care on the face and close to free margins and are usually
    the last reconstructive choice in these areas.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Split-thickness skin grafting
        of the right scalp and temple.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For all skin grafts there must be sufficient vascular tissue
    in the defect bed to support the graft, to allow initial
    diffusion of oxygen and nutrients to the graft (osmotic imbibition),
    followed by re-vascularization around the fourth to seventh
    day. Bare bone, tendon or cartilage will not allow grafts
    to take, and other reconstructive options must be employed.
    Following skin grafting to a defect site, the avoidance of
    movement or shear of the graft on the vascular bed during
    the healing phase is vital and necessitates careful stabilisation
    of the graft with sutures and appropriate dressings such
    as a tie-over pack (Figure 4) or negative-pressure splinting
    for up to 10 days. Infection and development of a haematoma
    between the graft and the defect bed are the two other major
    causes of graft failure,</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Stabilisation of skin grafts is
        necessary. Proflavine-soaked packs and sponges are commonly
        used.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When properly chosen, skin grafts are often functionally and
    aesthetically successful. The disadvantages are that the
    colour, texture and physical bulk may not match the original
    tissue and may be inferior to the result that could be achieved
    with a local flap. Occasionally hypo- or hyperpigmentation
    can occur in the skin graft, and it is cosmetically detrimental.</p>
<h1 id="ventral-underside-tongue-and-floor-of-the-mouth">Ventral (underside) tongue and floor of the mouth</h1>
<p>The main aim in reconstructing these defects is to allow maximal
    movements of the residual tongue so that the best possible
    speech, eating and swallowing can be achieved. Small lesions
    can be excised with a laser and left to heal or can be excised
    and repaired with a skin graft, or the wound sometimes can
    be primarily closed with sutures (longitudinal better than
    transverse to reduce tethering). Larger defects can be repaired
    with a local flap (for example, a nasolabial flap or a radial
    forearm free flap).</p>
<p>Where the majority of the tongue has been removed, there will
    be little or no residual function. This defect is best reconstructed
    with bulk (for example, a pedicled pectoralis major flap)
    or large free flaps such as a latissimus dorsi flap (see
    Figure 5), or a rectus abdominis flap.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Bulky defects such as total glossectomy
        require bulky flaps to provide some form of function.

        and maintain her own weight without supplemental feeding.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="buccal-mucosa">Buccal mucosa</h1>
<p>The main requirement for this defect is to obtain closure by
    covering the area with a pliable lining while allowing for
    normal mouth opening. Superficial lesions can be excised
    with a laser and left to heal or repaired with a skin graft.
    Small deeper defects can be closed with a local flap. A large
    and deep defect is better repaired with a radial forearm
    free flap (see Figure 6). Through-and-through defects require
    bipaddled repair.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure6.jpg">

        mucosa squamous cell carcinoma; right: reconstruction

</figure>
<h1 id="mandible">Mandible</h1>
<p>Where a segmental resection is required for bone invasion by
    cancer (see Figure 7), it is likely that the area will receive
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> as an
    adjuvant measure for local control. A free non-vascularized
    bone graft is unlikely to survive such hostile treatment.
    Ideally, a vascularized bone flap followed by dental implant
    insertion should be considered for optimal rehabilitation.
    Suitable flaps include the fibula (good length; see Figure
    7), which can be combined with other flaps because of its
    long pedicle (see Figure 7), and the DCIA (deep circumflex
    iliac artery; large bone stock but much shorter pedicle;
    see Figure 8) free flaps.</p>

        X-ray image.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Anterior (front) segments of the mandible if left unreconstructed
    will leave severe deformity and collapse of the chin with
    drooling. There are few reasonable alternatives to composite
    free flaps. Lateral (side) defects of the mandible, although
    best restored by composite flaps, can be simply treated with
    a reconstruction plate to maintain continuity with an enveloping
    bulky soft tissue flaps (such as the pectoralis major flap)
    when somebody is not fit for a free-flap surgical procedure.</p>
<p>The available options for mandibular reconstruction include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Free bone grafts</strong> – a corticocancellous block
        graft is taken from the anterior (front) or posterior
        (back) iliac crest. Free bone grafts are still a good
        option for defects that are not bigger than approximately
        5 cm, provided that the soft tissues are in good condition.
        Gaps larger than 5 cm are not really suitable for this
        means of bridging a defect. In most cases of malignancy
        when a large part of the surrounding soft tissues is
        lacking, healing cannot be ensured. Previous or anticipated
        radiotherapy would also be a contraindication for the
        use of free bone grafts. Studies comparing the anterior
        and posterior iliac crest as donor sites reveal less
        donor site morbidity when the posterior site is used.</li>
    <li><strong>Reconstruction plates</strong> – these are rigid
        plates that are applied along the lower border of the
        mandible. They were made with the intention of bridging
        a defect, thus will stabilise occlusion and facial contour.
        They are currently used to fix corticocancellous blocks
        or vascularized bone grafts to the remaining mandible.
        There are several types of these plates on the market,
        but the overriding principle is to have one single plate
        of sufficient thickness and width to hold the fragments
        in place, approximately 3 mm thick and 5 mm wide. A special
        feature is the locking screw. This type of screw is supposed
        to minimise compression between the plate and the underlying
        bone and thereby optimise the vascularity surrounding
        the graft.</li>
    <li><strong>Free flaps</strong> – these include fibula, DCIA
        and scapula free flaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Particulate cancellous bone and marrow grafts</strong>        – these must be placed in a frame (a crib).</li>
    <li><strong>Transport disc distraction osteogenesis</strong>        – a segment of bone is cut adjacent to the defect (transport
        disc) and is moved gradually across the defect.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="maxilla">Maxilla</h1>
<p>The main aims of rehabilitating this defect are to achieve coverage
    and to seal the oral cavity from the floor of nose and antrum.
    This has been traditionally managed with an obturator (prosthesis;
    see below). Where facial skin and the orbit can be preserved,
    it remains a reasonable option by allowing a patient to speak,
    eat and look normal while the obturator is worn.</p>
<p>There is a trend toward microvascular reconstruction of maxillary
    defects with the aim of doing away with the prosthesis. This
    technique has a better outcome for larger defects than obturation
    and is much preferable if facial skin is involved in the
    defect. It is technically more challenging, and care is required
    to ensure that adequate pedicle length and suitable vessels
    are available for anastomosing the flap. Flaps commonly used
    for this defect include DCIA, fibula, rectus abdominis, latissimus
    dorsi and radial forearm flaps (see Figure 9 and Figure 10
    for examples).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Top: a squamous cell carcinoma
        of the palate that resulted in a low-level maxillectomy;

        using a radial forearm flap.</figcaption>

        rectus abdominis free flap can be segmentalised; bottom
        right: early facial result; bottom left: early oral result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="lip">Lip</h1>
<p>The lips are an important area in terms of cosmesis and function
    (lip seal, speech and eating). Full-thickness defects of
    up to one third of the lip can be primarily closed. Intermediate
    full-thickness defects can be reconstructed with <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">local flaps</a>,
    or Abbe flaps. An Abbe flap involves rotating a wedge of
    lip from the opposite side of the lip by using a two-staged
    technique. Total full-thickness lip defects can be repaired
    using bilateral fan flaps, or with a free tissue transfer
    with tendon slings.</p>
<h1 id="pharynx">Pharynx</h1>
<p>An intact oropharynx is vital for swallowing and speech. Partial
    defects can be repaired using a rigid bulky flap such as
    the pectoralis major flap with the aim of allowing remaining
    tissue to have some function. If the defect requires the
    creation of a circumferential tube, alternatives include
    free soft tissue transfers such as a tubed radial forearm
    (largely historical now) or anterolateral thigh and jejunal
    free flaps.</p>
<h1 id="prosthetic-rehabilitation">Prosthetic rehabilitation</h1>
<p>The use of nonbiological materials to reconstruct certain head
    and neck defects is an established and effective option.
    These defects include auricular (ear; implant-retained ear
    prosthesis), maxillary and total rhinectomy (nose resection)
    defects (prosthesis retained with undercuts or implants).
    It is important to assess somebody’s compliance and dexterity
    (to keep implants clean and to remove and reinsert prostheses)
    at the planning stage. This preoperative assessment and planning
    should be carried out with prosthodontist and maxillofacial
    technician so that optimal results can be achieved.</p>
<h2>Maxillary prosthesis</h2>
<p>This removable reconstructive option involves taking an impression
    before surgery to make a dressing plate. When the surgical
    defect is created, the dressing plate is used with a suitable
    obturator material (gutta percha or silicone) to provide
    support for the cheek, create an undercut to aid retention
    of the prosthesis and seal the oral cavity from the nasal
    and antral cavities to enable speech and swallowing. The
    plate can be secured with wires or screws. The inner wall
    of the defect is usually grafted with split-thickness skin
    to speed up healing, and coroniodectomy (removal of a small
    top part of the mandible) is performed to stop dislodgment
    of the obturator by mandibular lateral excursions.</p>
<p>The dressing plate and obturator are removed several weeks later
    for impressions to reconstruct an interim removable obturator.
    This is followed by a definitive prosthesis several months
    later. The prosthesis can be a single piece hollowed (to
    reduce weight and aid retention) or two-pieced (soft bung
    superiorly with rigid conventional oral plate) prosthesis.
    Existing teeth within the same arch can be used to improve
    retention of the prosthesis with the aid of clasps. The maxillary
    obturator prosthesis for low-level maxillary defects is an
    excellent reconstructive option – so much so that some patients
    tend to refuse any secondary flap options if offered.</p>
<p>Solitary ear prosthesis was traditionally retained with glue
    (unsatisfactorily!). The advent of <a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">osseointegrated implants</a>    heralded a major improvement in this area. Larger complex
    defects involving the skin can be ‘reconstructed’ using multi-pieced
    obturators retained with implants, interconnecting joints
    or spectacles. However, the skin component coloration tends
    to fade with time and sun exposure. Facial components look
    good when they are still, but facial movements display gaps.
    However, they are better than patches.</p>
<h2>Osseointegrated implants</h2>
<p>It is inevitable that ablation surgery will alter the movements,
    pliability and anatomy of the oral and facial structures.
    Although clever use of undercuts and interconnecting multi-pieced
    prostheses are effective, retention of prostheses can remain
    a problem.</p>
<p>The introduction of osseointegrated implants has been a major
    advancement in overcoming this problem. Placement of implants
    requires adequate bone stock (reconstruction with DCIA or
    fibula free flaps preferred to radial composite free flaps)
    and good patient compliance and dexterity (to maintain a
    high standard of hygiene) as well as clinical resources (funding,
    expertise and further surgery). At some sites, however, these
    implants can give a prosthetic reconstruction unachievable
    by surgical treatment alone (see Figure 11).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-reconstruction-level3-figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Top left: orbital osseointegrated
        implants; top right: orbital prosthesis; bottom: implant-borne
        orbital prosthesis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Implants can be inserted at the same time as the flap, but accurate
    alignment for prosthetic use is much more difficult. When
    the implants are inserted following adjuvant radiotherapy
    (the usual approach in practice), some clinicians advocate
    <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">hyperbaric oxygen therapy, HBO</a>    to reduce the risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis</a>.</p>
<h1 id="a-general-summary">A general summary</h1>
<p>It is important to reiterate that ablative surgery (the degree
    of healthy tissue sacrificed in the name of aiming to cure)
    must not be compromised for the sake of reconstruction. In
    addition, any comorbidity of a patient has a significant
    bearing in predicting outcomes and must be considered as
    part of the treatment plan.</p>
<p>The advantages of each reconstructive technique should be weighed,
    and the best possible option available (bearing in mind available
    expertise) to suit the patient and the defect should be used.
    Donor site morbidity should be taken into account.</p>
<p>Reconstructive surgical techniques have advanced significantly.
    The larger and the more complex a defect, the more impaired
    a patient will be functionally. Good communication is essential
    for properly informed decisions, for realistic expectations
    and for engagement in the process.</p>
<p>Technical innovations include preoperative <a href="/diagnosis/tests/maths/3d-image">virtual planning</a>    of both the resection and the reconstruction, to allow precision
    positioning of the osteotomies and shaping of the retaining
    plate with pre-planned jigs. Whether the operating time saved
    justifies the additional cost and (current) preoperative
    delay in most patients requiring osseous reconstruction (malignant
    disease) or whether this technology will be reserved for
    resections for benign disease only remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the reconstructive option chosen should be a joint
    decision between the surgeon and the patient, based on a
    balance of risks (including comorbidity) and benefits, as
    well as an honest assessment of the expertise available at
    a clinical unit. The goal must be to use the simplest and
    most reliable technique possible to achieve the best possible
    rehabilitation.</p>
