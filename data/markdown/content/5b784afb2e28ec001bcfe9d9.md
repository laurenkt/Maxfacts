<p>Anticonvulsants, also known as antiepileptics, are drugs that
    are commonly used in the treatment of epileptic seizures.
    They have a second / additional life as medicinal drugs in
    both the stabilisation of mood and in the treatment of pain.
    Whilst they are not designed as analgesics (painkillers),
    they can be effective in the treatment of some forms of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">chronic pain</a>, in particular the acute pain of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain syndromes (including pain caused by herpes)</a>        and a range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">neuropathies</a>.
        The effect can differ from person to person, and from
        condition to condition, sometimes these medications may
        have no beneficial effect at all â€“ but it is worth to
        explore as a potential treatment option for some of these
        difficult-to-treat chronic pain conditions.</p>
<p>If they are effective, only a low dosage is needed in their role
    as analgesics for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Drugs
    that are used for such purposes are carbamazepine, gabapentin
    and pregabalin (Figure 1).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The molecular structures of carbamazepine,

</figure>
<p><strong>Carbamazepine</strong> was first synthesised in 1953
    and was first marketed as a drug to treat trigeminal neuralgia
    in 1962, including its use as a prophylactic treatment. Carbamazepine
    is still the drug of choice for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia
    and can be used in the diagnosis of the condition.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of carbamazepine is thought to be by
    blocking <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">voltage-gated sodium channels</a>,
    binding to inactivated sodium channels and stopping them
    from becoming active again. This stops the action potential
    moving along neurons. Carbamazepine also has some action
    against voltage-gated calcium channels, stopping calcium
    influx causing the release of neurotransmitters, while also
    increasing the amount of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/gaba">GABA</a>    (a ubiquitous messenger molecule) and decreasing the amount
    of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.</p>
<p><strong>Gabapentin</strong> is an analogue of GABA. Gabapentin
    was synthesised in 1977 for the treatment of spasticity and
    epilepsy. <strong>Pregabalin</strong> is another analogue
    of GABA that was developed a decade after gabapentin and
    has a very similar <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">mechanism of action</a>    and effect on the body. Whilst both are GABA analogues, they
    have no activity against GABA receptors, channels or transporters.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">gabapentin and pregabalin</a>    is not fully understood but the analgesic action is thought
    to be due to action on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">voltage-gated calcium channels</a>,
    stopping release of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Pregabalin is six times more potent than gabapentin and has a
    greater <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">bioavailability</a>    , so is more likely than gabapentin to have dose levels that
    are both effective and tolerable.</p>
