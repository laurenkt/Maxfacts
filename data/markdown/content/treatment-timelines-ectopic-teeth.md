<p>Removal of ectopic teeth is an extremely common surgical procedure
    the rationale of which are described in our section on the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">diagnosis of ectopic teeth</a>,
    the procedures for which are described in our section on
    the <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth/detailed">treatment of ectopic teeth</a>,
    and the potential problems in our section about <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/teeth">postoperative problems</a>.</p>
<p>The timelines will vary depending on the degree of surgery required,
    principally on the amount of bone removed in order to access
    the relevant tooth. Very minimal bone removal in young elastic
    bone will create a short 2 to 3 day period of swelling and
    discomfort with a return to near pre-operation situation
    within a week. Extensive bone removal in an older patient
    (jaw bone increases in density and decreases in elasticity
    over the age of approximately 40) can result in 7 to 10 days
    of swelling and discomfort which may be prolonged if a
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">dry socket</a> occurs.</p>
<p>Unless quite minimal surgery is involved, a week away from work
    or other strenuous activity such as sport is advisable.</p>
<p>In instances where unwanted events occur such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">lingual or inferior alveolar nerve damage</a>    occur, or an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">oro-antral fistula</a>    is created, the healing timeline is prolonged by management
    of those conditions.</p>
