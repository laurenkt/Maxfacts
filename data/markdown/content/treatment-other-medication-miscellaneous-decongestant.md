<p>Probably everybody at some point in time has used some nasal
    spray to unblock a stuffy nose when afflicted by a bad cold,
    hay fever (or other allergic reactions), or sinusitis. Whilst
    such decongestant nasal sprays do not treat the underlying
    condition, they can be effective in rapidly easing the symptoms
    of a blocked nose.</p>
<p>In oral and maxillofacial surgery, nasal decongestant sprays
    are mainly used to ease symptoms of nasal or antral mucosal
    swelling after surgery. Examples are <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/more-info">midface and orbital fractures</a>,
    or following surgery to close an <a href="/treatment/surgery/fistula/more-info">oroantral fistula</a>    when postoperatively blowing of the nose should be avoided.</p>
<p>Amongst a number of medicinal agents available for nasal decongestion,
    xylometazoline and oxymetazoline are widely used (see Figure
    1 for the molecular structures).</p>

</figure>
<p>The two chemicals xylometazoline and oxymetazoline are very closely
    related to each other. Both are designed to act as activators
    (agonists) of receptors of adrenaline in the nose, both drugs
    achieve this by mimicking some aspects of the molecular structure
    of adrenaline (Figure 1). The topical application of decongestant
    medications is effective because of the large number of adrenergic
    receptors in the blood vessels in the nasal mucosa.</p>
<p>Nasal congestion occurs because of swelling of the larger veins
    in the nasal mucosa (to be distinguished from veins in nasal
    skin which are relevant in <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">skin surgery</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">rhinoplasty (corrective surgery on the nose)</a>),
    in response to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    and/or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>.
    Decongestion after <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">topical application</a>    occurs by <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">vasoconstriction</a>    of larger veins and small arteries, increasing the volume
    of the nasal airway and easing nasal breathing. In addition,
    the exudation (oozing) of fluids is reduced.</p>
<p>This type of decongestant medication is not suitable for long-term
    use and should be used with caution if hypertension (high
    blood pressure) is an issue. Long-term use can lead to damage
    of the nasal mucosa as well as to the development of tolerance
    and rebound (chronic) congestion (known as rhinitis medicamentosa)
    after terminating the use of the drug.</p>
