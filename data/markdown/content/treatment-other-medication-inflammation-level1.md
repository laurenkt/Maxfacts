<p>Inflammation is the body’s response to infection and injury,
    its basic reaction to tissue damage. It is a protective mechanism
    and is part of the healing process. It can be seen as the
    body’s attempt to eliminate offending agents.</p>
<p>Inflammation can have biological (pathogens or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrotic (dead) tissue</a>),
    chemical (toxic substances) or physical (extreme temperatures,
    trauma) causes or can be the result of abnormal immune responses
    (autoimmune conditions, allergic reactions).</p>
<p>The inflammatory process involves the host’s defence mechanism,
    the immune system. This is delivered by the circulatory and
    lymphatic system. In mammals the immune system is a sophisticated
    mechanism, made up of a non-specific immediate-response system
    (the innate immune system, which all living creatures have)
    and a specific-response layer which produces a delayed response.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to maintaining a sophisticated
    immune system. It is advantageous to have an immune system
    that, in principle, can prevent infections by drawing on
    its memory functions (antibodies) and/or initiate highly
    specific responses to infections. It is, however, expensive
    (biochemically speaking) for the host system to maintain
    such a defence system and the complicated system is vulnerable
    to small errors and imbalances that can lead to profound
    malfunctions of the immune system.</p>
<p>The immune system can be under- or overactive, and there can
    be abnormal immune responses to the host’s own tissues (autoimmune
    disorders) or to foreign agents, for example pollen causing
    hay fever. Regular as well as abnormal immune responses can
    be acute or chronic. The characteristics of acute and chronic
    inflammatory conditions differ considerably. The chronic
    process begins when in the acute inflammatory phase the immune
    system failed to eliminate the offending agent from the body.
    Autoimmune disorders tend to fluctuate between acute-phase-type
    and chronic-phase-type behaviour.</p>
<p>In order to understand the purposes of different interventions
    aimed at moderating various different inflammatory conditions,
    it is necessary to first have a closer look at the complicated
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">workings of the immune system</a>    and the cascade of inflammatory responses. Equipped with
    this insight, we will discuss a number of relevant inflammatory
    conditions and the working of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">medicinal drugs used to treat abnormal immune responses and other inflammatory conditions</a>.</p>
