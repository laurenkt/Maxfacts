<p>Bisphosphonates belong to a class of drugs called <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive agents</a>.
    These agents interfere with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">regular bone remodelling</a>    by hindering the bone resorption step in this process. Bisphosphonates
    inhibit the osteoclasts (the cells driving this part of the
    process) in various different ways. Bisphosphonates are widely
    used in the treatment of osteoporosis and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastatic bone disease</a>    and other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone malignancies</a>,
    such as multiple myeloma.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the regular bone remodelling
        processes and how these are disturbed by <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        or a range of medications, this is discussed on our
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">detailed page about bone necrosis</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Bisphosphonates are relevant in a maxillofacial context because
    of their adverse effects. These agents are nowadays the most
    common cause of medication-related <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">osteonecrosis of the jaws</a>    and often do require surgical intervention, including major
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the general chemical structure of a bisphosphonate.
    Two phosphonate groups (PO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and
    two further groups R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> are bonded
    to a central carbon atom.</p>

        unit.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a range of different bisphosphonates currently being
    prescribed (see below). In six out of eight of these, one
    of the R groups is a hydroxyl (OH) group. The hydroxyl group
    maximises bone affinity of the drug molecules by easing absorption
    into the calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) bone matrix.
    The other R group is the main determinant of the potency
    of a particular bisphosphonate agent (see below).</p>
<p>Figure 2 gives an overview of three generations of bisphosphonates.
    The first medical use of a bisphosphonate in the 1960s was
    the prescription of etidronate for the treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">Paget’s disease</a>,
    alongside numerous other technical uses of this general group
    of chemicals. The second and third generation bisphosphonates
    all contain a terminal amine (NR<sub>2</sub>) group in one
    of the R groups. In the third generation bisphosphonates,
    the amine group is incorporated in a ring structure. Across
    the range, all bisphosphonates share a high affinity to bond
    to bone mineral for long periods of time (up to 15 years
    have been reported). Given their association with increased
    risk to develop <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">osteonecrosis (MRONJ)</a>    following invasive dentoalveolar surgery combined with the
    lasting presence of these agents in bone, a short interruption
    of the treatment (‘drug holidays’) to allow for oral surgical
    interventions makes no sense. The situation is slightly different
    for other antiresorptive agents, such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/denusomab">denusomab</a>.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Overview of the range of commonly
        used bisphosphonates and their respective chemical structures.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 2 also lists the relative potency of the different bisphosphonates,
    covering a wide range from a potency of 1 (etidronate) all
    the way to a potency of 10,000 (zolendronate). This difference
    in potency is far too large to be explained simply by differences
    in affinity to the bone surface. The term ‘potency’ with
    respect to bisphosphonates relates to their inhibitory potency
    for bone resorption. The numerical values for the relative
    potencies are derived from measuring the dose of a particular
    drug that is required to achieve a 50 % reduction of bone
    resorption. This is called an IC<sub>50</sub> value, the
    half-maximum inhibitory concentration. The higher that required
    dose, the lower the resulting potency. Osteoclast inhibition
    cannot be determined directly, but IC<sub>50</sub> values
    for a range of bisphosphonates have been derived from <i>in vivo</i>    and <i>in vitro</i> observations. <i>In vivo</i> data are
    derived from the measurement of biomarkers for bone resorption
    in <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood</a> and
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/urine-tests">urine</a> samples and correlate well with <i>in vitro</i>        obtained data.</p>
<p>Bisphosphonates can be administered either intravenously or orally
    (in tablet form). In terms of actual potency in clinical
    applications of bisphosphonates, the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">drug delivery</a>    method has an impact too. When administered intravenously,
    the actual potency is higher as bisphosphonates have a much
    higher <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">bioavailability</a>    in this delivery mode than when administered orally. For
    example, it was found that alendronate has an average oral
    bioavailability of less than one percent. A large difference
    in bioavailability is due to the poor absorption of bisphosphonates
    through the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>The large difference in potency between 1<sup>st</sup> generation
    bisphosphonates and nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (2<sup>nd</sup>    and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation) has been (and continues to
    be) the subject of active research. All bisphosphonates share
    a high affinity of binding to the bone surface, presumably
    enhanced by the presence of one R group in the molecule being
    an OH group. In addition, there must be further mechanisms
    at work, in terms of specific biochemical targets and interactions.</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> generation bisphosphonates tend to inhibit osteoclast
    activity by interference with intracellular ATP (adenosine-triphosphate)
    metabolism. The nitrogen-containing (and far more potent)
    bisphosphonates work by a different mechanism. They inhibit
    an enzyme (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, FPPS). This enzyme
    is crucial in the biosynthesis of a number of proteins which,
    in turn, are essential for the production of biomolecules
    that are required for the function of osteoclasts (and other
    cells), such as lipids. This blockage has a profound impact
    on the function of osteoclasts and is in line with the high
    potency of the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates.This mode
    of action could be seen as a poisoning of the osteoclasts.
    The current understanding is that the FPPS interaction mechanism
    is the main mode of action of these nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
    but additional potential biochemical targets in the bone
    metabolism are being investigated. The high affinity of all
    bisphosphonates to bone is further being discussed as a potential
    vehicle to deliver other drugs specifically to bone tissue.</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> generation bisphosphonates have been compared
    with an alternative <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive agent</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/denusomab">denusomab</a>.
    Whilst treatment with all antiresorptive agents carries the
    risk to develop <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ)</a>,
    there are distinct differences between these two classes
    of antiresorptive agents. When treatment is discontinued,
    the effects of denusomab are more rapidly reversed (within
    a few months) than for bisphosphonates (where persistence
    of more than 10 years has been observed). The concept of
    ‘drug holidays’ for denusomab to reduce the risk of developing
    osteonecrosis after dentoalveolar procedures (such as tooth
    extractions), is potentially useful but is not a realistic
    option for bisphosphonate treatment schemes.</p>

    bisphosphonates.</p>
