<p>Treatments of postoperative problems affecting the femur (long
    bone in the thigh) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only known problem is a scar on the thigh that will benefit
        from <a href="/help/physiotherapy">scar massage</a>.</li>
    <li>The outer cortex of the distal (bottom end) of the femur
        can be used as a vascularised bone flap. The blood vessels
        used are non-essential to the leg. Pain is minimal and
        no fractures have been reported.</li>
</ul>
