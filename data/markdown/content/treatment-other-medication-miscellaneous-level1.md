<p>The majority of medicinal drugs commonly used in maxillofacial
    surgery are agents used to treat <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">infections</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">pain</a> and
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a> and are discussed in detail in the relevant
        sections discussing treatment by medication.</p>
<p> However, some additional well-established medicinal drugs that
    are relevant in maxillofacial surgery are not covered by
    the three treatment categories of infection, inflammation
    and pain. These medications, their roles and working principles
    are briefly described in this section. The content of this
    page is given in alphabetical order.</p>
