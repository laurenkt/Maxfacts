<p>The timelines and types of activities in terms of oral
    hygiene and dental (rehabilitation) treatments during
    and after treatment(s) for malignancies vary. Not only
    do these two arms of activities follow different
    patterns of high and low activity at different stages,
    but the exact nature of interventions strongly depends
    on the type and stage of the malignancy and the
    respective pursued treatment modalities.</p>
<p>Our main focus are restorative dentistry and oral hygiene
    during and after treatment of head &amp; neck
    malignancies. However, treatment for other malignancies,
    mainly <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy/more-info">haematological
        malignancies</a> treated with systemic <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapies</a>
    and/or stem cell transplants may require support and
    treatment for oral hygiene issues and/or dental
    rehabilitation. These needs could be short- and/or
    long-term needs.</p>
<h2>Dental status and interventions</h2>
<p>The essential differences following treatment of head and
    neck cancers are based around whether or not <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> has
    been used.</p>
<p>If surgery is/was the only treatment modality, then the
    challenges for dental interventions are essentially
    mechanical. Is mouth opening limited, is attached
    gingivae (gums) present or has skin covered this area?
    Are cervical margins (area between crown and root of a
    tooth) exposed and painful? Each of these and more have
    specific restorative dentistry solutions.</p>
<p>If radiotherapy has been used, the above has a
    significant additional challenge. The bone, mucosa and
    any new (flap) tissue has been exposed to sufficient
    radiation to create a risk when asking cells to divide
    and reproduce. Put simply, if the irradiated cells are
    not asked to do much, they may well be fine. If they are
    asked to work because of surgery â€“ even something as
    apparently simple as a tooth removal, they might <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrose (die)</a>;
    this remains a life-long risk. The restorative dentistry
    challenge here is complex and must aim to avoid this.
    This is why a <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-pretreatment">pre-treatment
        dental assessment</a> by someone who understands
    this position is so important.</p>
<p>The role of <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">systemic
        chemotherapy</a> in both children and adults creates
    risk of acute reduction in <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">red blood
        cells, white blood cells and platelets</a> .
    Together and individually they can create serious issues
    with regard to bleeding and infection if any hidden
    dental pathology presents itself at this time. For
    children, depending on the age when they are treated
    with systemic chemotherapy, this may damage the dental
    development with stunted growth of teeth and resulting
    long-term needs for restorative dentistry interventions.
</p>
<h2>Oral hygiene</h2>
<p>The skills learned and practiced in terms of a <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">personal oral hygiene</a>
    regimen continue to be of great importance during and
    following cancer treatment. Different types of treatment
    bring with them new challenges in terms of oral hygiene
    and maintaining good oral health. Some such difficulties
    are temporary, other challenges are permanent. For
    example, difficulties resulting from surgery tend to be
    temporary in nature and resolve to a degree of new (or
    very nearly old) normal over fairly short periods of
    time. In contrast, oral health issue related to <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> or
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> to
    the head and neck region tend to build up slowly, take a
    longer time to resolve, or (especially after
    radiotherapy) will remain a life-long concern.</p>
<p>Having the right information for the particular situation
    at all times, skills and motivation are essential, as is
    the willingness to help oneself by adapting to the new
    situation. The oral hygiene team are well placed to give
    help, advice and encouragement at all stages during and
    after treatment. Their helping hand may literally be a
    helping hand to learn new techniques and/or to provide
    the best possible professional clean, but they are also
    a great source of information about practical tips and
    general advice.</p>
