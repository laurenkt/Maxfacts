<p>In much the same way that it was difficult to create a multiple
    user friendly list of topics for public and professionals,
    it was difficult to make a series of pigeon holes for post-operative
    problems.</p>
<p>We have therefore resorted to allocating the body part involved
    and breaking that down into problems that may affect that
    body part after an intervention.</p>
<p>This will follow a version of what is sometimes termed the “surgical
    sieve”; a list of pathological processes: infection, inflammation,
    failure of the procedure (for whatever reason), tumour recurrence,
    ischaemic necrosis and a number of operation specific problems.</p>
