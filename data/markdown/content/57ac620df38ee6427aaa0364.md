<p>Here we discuss additional and/or alternative treatment options
    that are not covered in the sections about <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> or
    <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>.</p>
<p>By far the biggest theme in this section are the various forms
    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication">treatments by medication</a>    for a considerable range of conditions. Further, less common
    treatment schemes such as the application of <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">extreme temperatures</a>,
    of <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">hyperbaric oxygen</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous">miscellaneous established schemes</a>    are explained as well.</p>
<p>This section would not be complete without paying attention to
    promising new ideas and developments, leading to <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments">novel treatment options</a>    with respect to medication or otherwise.</p>
