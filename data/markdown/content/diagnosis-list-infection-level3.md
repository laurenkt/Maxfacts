<h1 id="normal-oral-nasal-and-skin-microflora">Normal oral, nasal and skin microflora</h1>
<p>The human body is colonised by commensal microorganisms, with
    numbers so great that they outnumber the cells of the body.
    These microorganisms, mostly bacteria, generally have no
    direct positive or negative effect on the host under normal
    circumstances. However, as part of the body’s normal microflora
    the commensal microorganisms benefit from nutrients and a
    hospitable environment provided by the host. In turn, they
    play an important role for the bodily functions of the host,
    for example vitally in digestion, or as part of the body’s
    defence mechanisms, the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">immune system</a>.</p>
<h2>Microflora</h2>
<p>The commensal microflora are the microorganisms present on the
    linings of hollow structures and on the surface of the body.
    These inner and outer body surfaces are covered by epithelial
    cells and are unprotected from the external environment (see
    Figure 1).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Sketch of the colonies of commensal
        bacteria on epithelial cells; the zoom illustrates the
        fundamental functional units of bacteria (which can be
        targeted by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial drugs</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As the commensal bacteria evolved alongside their hosts, they
    do not usually pose a threat to the health of the host. Because
    of their co-evolution with the host, commensal bacteria are
    not normally recognised as pathogens by the host’s immune
    system. Commensal bacteria are in balance (homeostasis) with
    each other and with the host. Different body regions typically
    host different colonies of commensal microorganisms, as every
    strain is uniquely adapted to suit its preferred location
    (and there are individual differences between hosts). Typically
    anaerobic microorganisms of the small intestine, for example
    make use of the stable temperature and rich supply of nutrients
    there. Simultaneously the host benefits from their presence
    in a number of ways. In particular, commensal bacteria in
    the small intestine aid with digestion of plant matter which
    we would otherwise be unable to consume.</p>
<p>The maxillofacial region typically is host to a number of
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Gram-positive as well Gram-negative
        species</a>. For example, <i>staphylococcus</i> is uniquely
        adapted to live on the skin, it is able to cope with
        the high salt content of sweat and even uses sweat as
        a nutrient source.</p>
<p><strong>Skin flora</strong> colonies typically include</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>staphylococci</i></li>
    <li><i>streptococci</i> of the <i>viridans</i> group</li>
    <li>Gram-positive and Gram-negative <i>diphtheroids</i></li>
    <li><i>candida albicans</i></li>
    <li><i>malassezia furfur</i> (common fungus species, can cause
        a range of skin infections and inflammation, including
        seborrhoeic dermatitis).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oral flora</strong> colonies typically include</p>
<ul>
    <li>alpha-haemolytic <i>streptococci</i></li>
    <li>non-haemolytic <i>streptococci</i></li>
    <li>Gram-negative <i>cocci</i></li>
    <li><i>actinomyces</i> species</li>
    <li><i>actinobacillus actinomyetemcomitans</i> (particularly
        relevant in <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>)</li>
    <li>Gram-negative anaerobic rods</li>
    <li><i>Spirochaetes</i> (group of bacteria causing, for example,
        Lyme disease)</li>
    <li><i>candida</i> species.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses</strong> are typically
    colonised by</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gram-positive rods</li>
    <li>Gram-positive <i>cocci</i></li>
    <li>Gram-negative <i>cocci</i>, for example <i>neisseria</i>        (large group of bacteria, including species that can
        cause meningitis).</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific and non-specific <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">host defence mechanisms</a>    exist to prevent microbial infection. These defence mechanisms
    are well developed in the head and neck region and include:
    an intact epithelial surface; nasal mucus, <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">saliva</a>    and tears, all of which have antimicrobial properties. The
    commensal microflora also acts as an important non-specific
    defence mechanism (see Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level3-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> By occupying and colonising the
        epithelial surface, commensal bacteria increase the difficulty
        for other pathogens to establish themselves on the epithelium
        and cause infection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition, the commensal microflora also have a part to play
    in the immune response. They have generally immune-activating
    properties which stimulate the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">innate (non-specific) and adaptive (specific) immune defence mechanisms</a>    pathways when confronted with invading pathogens (this is
    symbolised in Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level3-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Commensal bacteria trigger initial
        signal / response in a long and complicated signal pathway
        which activates immune response(s) to the presence of
        invading pathogens; here the purple shapes symbolise
        release of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">pathogen-specific antibodies</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the commensal microflora is altered, overgrowth of certain
    organisms can occur, leading to symptomatic infection (opportunistic
    infection). This is exemplified by the frequency with which
    candidal infection occurs following broad-spectrum antibacterial
    therapy. Broad-spectrum antibacterial agents not only damage
    their targets, they also harm commensal bacteria, leading
    to an imbalanced microflora (dysbiosis). This creates opportunities
    for overgrowth by other pathogens (this mechanism is illustrated
    in Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level3-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Illustration of mechanism for
        opportunistic infections, enabled by broad-banded antibacterial
        agents.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Commensal bacteria can interfere with the immune system of the
    host in further ways. Slight misalignments and misregulation
    of the delicate balance of the immune system can trigger
    an exaggerated immune response of the host to commensal bacteria,
    for example giving rise to an overexpressed inflammatory
    response. On the other hand, the immune system’s mechanisms
    allowing for the co-existence of host and commensal bacteria
    may lead to pathological infections if commensal bacteria
    enter body regions where they are usually not found (for
    example, by trauma).</p>
<p>These aspects are relevant in not only the <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage">treatment of traumatic facial wounds</a>    but also generally in oral surgery as the oral cavity cannot
    be sterilised. In consequence, oral surgery will always lead
    to bacteraemia (presence of bacteria in the blood). This
    may be unproblematically resolved by an intact immune system
    in otherwise healthy people. However, people subjected to
    major and lengthy maxillofacial surgical procedures, people
    with a compromised <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune system</a>,
    or with a foreign body implanted (for example, a prosthetic
    joint or heart valve) are at risk of developing potentially
    serious infections following surgical interventions and will
    require risk assessment and possibly <a href="/treatment/surgery/infection">prophylaxis before (as well as during and after) surgery</a>.</p>
<h1 id="unwanted-effects-of-antibiotic-agents">Unwanted effects of antibiotic agents</h1>
<h2>Side effects of antibacterial agents</h2>
<p>Antibacterial agents often are the first-line, sometimes the
    only crucial treatment for bacterial infections, sometimes
    in combination with <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgical interventions</a>.
    The <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">working principles of antibacterial agents</a>    aim to take advantage of the specific properties of bacterial
    cells and their metabolism where these differ from the host’s
    cell properties and metabolism. Still, like any form of systemic
    medication, antibacterial agents will have unwanted side
    effects on the host. Such unwanted effects can occur during
    treatment but may also extend beyond the treatment period.</p>
<p>The wanted effects of antibacterial agents in harming harmful
    bacteria can be roughly subdivided into four groups of mechanisms,
    affecting the bacterial cell wall, metabolism, protein synthesis
    or DNA.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the working mechanisms of
        antibiotic drugs, this information is in our section
        about <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">treatment of infections by medication</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Unwanted effects of antibacterial agents can be roughly categorised
    according to the same four classes of working mechanisms.
    Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the general side
    effects from systemic treatment with antibacterial drugs
    within these categories.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all antibacterial drugs have a negative impact
    on the entire gastrointestinal (digestive) tract, especially
    when <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">taken orally</a>.
    This is mainly because of their disruptive effect on the
    helpful and necessary bacterial microflora of the intestines.
    As a result, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating and indigestion
    as well as diarrhoea and loss of appetite are common side
    effects of antibacterial drugs. It is also common for many
    antibacterial drugs to trigger a range of different <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">allergic reactions</a>    of variable severity.</p>
<p>Side effects of antibacterial agents that affect the <strong>bacterial cell wall</strong>    (for example penicillin and its many derivatives) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>anaphylaxis (a fast and serious, potentially life-threatening
        allergic reaction)</li>
    <li>Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a protracted allergic reaction
        with flu-like symptoms and progression to a rash and
        blisters)</li>
    <li>urticaria (an allergic skin reaction, also known as hives)</li>
    <li>acute exanthemic pustulosis (a rare, severe allergic reaction
        that affects the skin and other organs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Side effects of antibacterial agents that affect the <strong>bacterial metabolism</strong>    (for example sulphonamides) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>generally high allergy rates (‘Sulfa allergy’; most susceptible
        are people with slow metabolism and with long-term viral
        infections)</li>
    <li>drug hypersensitivity syndrome (severe, delayed allergic
        reaction that affects skin and other organs)</li>
    <li>hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels caused by stimulated
        insulin release)</li>
    <li>blood dyscrasias (a range of haematological conditions with
        deviations from the normal composition of blood).</li>
</ul>
<p>Side effects of antibacterial agents that affect the <strong>bacterial protein synthesis</strong>    (a wide range of different drugs, including macrolides (erythromycin)
    and clindamycin) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>potentially severe disturbances of the gastrointestinal system
        (including ulcerative colitis)</li>
    <li>pro-arrhythmic action (increasing or decreasing heart rate,
        or causing irregular heart beat)</li>
    <li>hepatotoxicity (toxic effects on the liver as this class
        of drugs is metabolised in the liver)</li>
    <li>effects on respiratory system (changing quantity and quality
        of mucus in the respiratory system)</li>
    <li>allergic skin reactions</li>
    <li>rarely hearing loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Side effects of antibacterial agents that affect the <strong>bacterial DNA</strong>    (for example metronidazole) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>interactions with alcohol and other drugs</li>
    <li>disturbances of the gastrointestinal system</li>
    <li>otherwise only rarely associated with severe unwanted effects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Side effects of antifungal agents</h2>
<p>Largely similar to the unwanted effects of antibacterial agents,
    antifungal agents are usually likely to cause some stomach
    complaints, nausea, flatulence and diarrhoea. Allergic reactions
    are also common and may result in swelling of the face and
    airways (in severe cases) and/or skin rashes.</p>
<h2>Side effects of antiviral agents</h2>
<p>With the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">working principles of antiviral drugs</a>    being distinctly different from those of antibacterial and
    antifungal drugs, it is not surprising that also the unwanted
    effects of antiviral drugs are different and mainly develop
    over extended treatment periods. Side effects commonly consist
    of flu-like symptoms and some psychogenic effects ranging
    from milder forms (irritability) to more severe forms (including
    depression). There may also be long-term impacts on the haematological
    system, such as haemolytic anaemia.</p>
<h1 id="sepsis">Sepsis</h1>
<h2>Some general facts</h2>
<p>Sepsis (formerly also called, and confused with, septicaemia
    or ‘blood poisoning’) is a serious, life-threatening inflammatory
    condition. It isn’t a very helpful term as it immediately
    conjures up the thought of overwhelming infection – which
    may or may not be a cause.</p>
<p>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused
    by a dysregulated host response to infection. Trauma, haemorrhage
    or burns may also be underlying causes for sepsis. Pathogens
    causing infections that lead to sepsis can be bacteria, viruses,
    fungi or other parasites; bacterial infections are the most
    common. The very young (new born babies in particular), the
    elderly, and people in generally poor health as well as those
    with a compromised immune system are most vulnerable to sepsis.</p>
<p>Not every aspect of the causes and development of sepsis is completely
    understood. It is difficult to understand how and why at
    some stage the immune system switches from fighting infectious
    pathogens to instead attacking and damaging the body’s tissues
    and organs. It has long been known that the immune response
    is a ‘two-edged sword’ that can harm both host and invader
    but why it should have such an extreme effect is puzzling.
    It is likely that the beginning of sepsis is triggered by
    an immune system response to combined host and pathogen factors.
    There is also some heterogeneity with different levels of
    over- or underactivity of the immune system that may occur
    at different stages of the disease (and with different people).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the immune system, its functions
        as well as its dysfunctions, this information is in our
        section on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Mortality related to sepsis remains stubbornly high, with nearly
    half of patients with sepsis or septic shock (a useful definition
    of the word ‘shock’ used in this context is a failure of
    oxygen delivery at a cellular level) still dying in 2016
    and sepsis being the primary cause of death from infection.
    The morbidity of survivors is also considerable, with, for
    example, about a third of adult sepsis survivors over the
    age of 60 not having returned to independent living after
    6 months, and many suffering a variety of long-term problems.</p>
<p>It is of key importance that sepsis is not only promptly recognised
    and distinguished from less severe infections but that investigations,
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/infection">treatment and monitoring</a>    are started immediately. With this in mind, in 2016 the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">3rd International Consensus</a> about definitions for sepsis
        and septic shock has been agreed. The aim is to improve
        clinical management and outcomes for sepsis.</p>
<h2>Signs and symptoms of sepsis</h2>
<p>Infection is associated with a localised inflammatory response.
    There may, however, be some viable pathogens (bacteria, fungi,
    viruses, other parasites) present in the blood stream, most
    likely bacteria.</p>
<p>A combination of some or all of the following symptoms is called
    systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS; with or without
    identifiable or identified source of infection):</p>
<ul>
    <li>body temperature &gt; 38 °C or &lt; 36 °C</li>
    <li>accelerated heart rate (tachycardia) &gt; 90 beats / min</li>
    <li>increased respiratory rate (tachypnoea) &gt; 20 breaths /
        min</li>
    <li>abnormally high or abnormally low <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">white blood cell count</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>SIRS in conjunction with presumed or proven infection used to
    be called sepsis; sepsis in conjunction with signs of acute
    organ dysfunction (such as hypotension (reduced blood pressure),
    reduced urine output, reduced oxygen saturation, and a range
    of biochemical markers) used to be called severe sepsis.
    Severe sepsis in conjunction with persistent hypotension,
    even after adequate fluid replacement, used to be called
    septic shock.</p>
<p>The definitions as revised in 2016 do not distinguish sepsis
    and severe sepsis anymore, septic shock is defined as a sub-set
    of sepsis with need for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">vasopressor</a>    treatment in addition to adequate fluid replacement in order
    to increase the mean arterial blood pressure to &gt; 65 mmHg
    and maintain lactate levels. This, of course, uses treatment
    modalities to define a pathophysiological condition which
    seems a little backward. The 2016 definitions also made recommendations
    to replace the SIRS criteria (as they have some shortcomings)
    by a slightly different system – but the newly proposed scheme
    has already been criticised and is likely to be changed again.
    The SIRS system is clinically well established and its use
    is continued.</p>
<h2>Underlying pathophysiology of sepsis</h2>
<p>The immune system is the body’s general defence mechanism. An
    appropriate response of the immune system to infection will
    eliminate the invading pathogens without harming the body
    tissues and organs. The immediate response to infection comes
    from the first layer of defence, the so called innate immune
    system (all living creatures have such a defence system).
    It provides an immediate, non-specific response and triggers
    (local) inflammation by the release of pro-inflammatory compounds
    and activates cellular responses. The second layer of defence
    is called the adaptive immune system which provides a delayed
    but more specific reaction to pathogens (only vertebrates
    have such a second layer of defence) and also acts as a long-lasting
    memory of infection in the body’s immune system.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the immune system, its functions
        as well as its dysfunctions, this information is in our
        section on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>There are two main pathological strands underlying the development
    of sepsis: overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediator molecules
    (cytokines) leading to organ-damaging responses and loss
    of regulation of the normal blood clotting balance, alongside
    further cellular dysfunction resulting from these two pathological
    mechanisms combined. The inflammatory and coagulation systems
    are generally closely related in regulating and maintaining
    body functions. It is also fair to state that the systemic
    inflammatory response in sepsis is not easily classifiable
    as a suppressed or overactive immune response – it can be
    argued that an initially underactive response from the immune
    system to infection, failing to eliminate the pathogens swiftly,
    logically mandates a much ramped-up response in the attempt
    to eliminate the infectious pathogens. It is even controversial
    if excessive inflammatory response is the main contributor
    to high mortality from sepsis and clinical trials using aggressive
    administration of anti-inflammatory agents did not lead to
    improved survival. Clearly, sepsis is a multi-factorial condition.
     </p>
<p>The combined effects of dysregulation of inflammatory response
    and coagulation cause multiple organ and tissue damage. Overstimulation
    of the production of pro-inflammatory compounds (cytokines,
    tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and a number of interleukins)
    all contribute to severely disturbed haemostasis. Normally,
    there is a very fine balance maintained between the flow
    properties of blood and coagulation. An initial response
    to overstimulation of pro-inflammatories is increased coagulation,
    leading to blood clots in the ‘wrong’ locations in the vascular
    system and thus causing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">tissue necrosis</a>    from lack of blood supply in the affected areas. On the other
    hand, damage to the vascular system from high levels of pro-inflammatory
    compounds in the system also leads to bleeding at specific
    sites because not enough coagulation-regulating factors,
    white blood cells and platelets, are in circulation. This
    seeming contradiction of simultaneously too high and too
    low levels and rates of coagulation (Disseminated Intravascular
    Coagulation, DIC) simply results from different local ‘interpretations’
    of the unbalanced state of the overall coagulation system.
    Much experience of the vascular management is gained from
    obstetric bleeding. It is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>The entire circulatory system is affected and resulting changes
    to the endothelium (especially the lining of the blood and
    lymphatic vessels) from the inflammatory response are related
    to organ damage, including widespread tissue oedema. Often
    lethal organ damage to, and failure of, the lungs, kidneys,
    nervous system and liver occur and may develop to so called
    multi-organ failure, often worsened by additional infection(s).</p>
