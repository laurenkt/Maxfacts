<p>Postoperative problems affecting the hypopharynx (bottom part
    of the throat) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Variations on the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">inability to swallow</a>.
        This can be from sticking of a dry or relatively large
        bolus of food, to complete obstruction, to liquids and
        overflow aspiration.</li>
    <li>Aspiration pneumonia is a risk.</li>
    <li>Extreme weight loss and dehydration can be seen in patients
        with less than complete obstruction who try to cope without
        professional input.</li>
    <li>Most of these conditions lie outwith the area of expertise
        of maxillofacial surgery.</li>
</ul>
<aside>
    <p>Read about possible remedies for these problems in our section
        about <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems">treatment of postoperative problems</a>.</p>
