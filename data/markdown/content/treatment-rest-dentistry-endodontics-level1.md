<p>At the centre of a tooth is the ‘pulp’. This contains blood vessels,
    connective tissue and a nerve supply to the tooth. This gives
    the tooth feeling, sensitivity and keeps the tooth ‘alive’.
    It is possible however, for the pulp to get inflamed, or
    infected, eventually leading to pulp death (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>).
    There are several key reasons why this may happen:</p>
<ul>
    <li>trauma - if there is a blow to a tooth, the pulp can die
        in response;</li>
    <li>a crack in the tooth allowing bacteria close to, or in to
        the pulp space;</li>
    <li>over-heating of a tooth (during some dental procedures);</li>
    <li>if a tooth is knocked out (avulsed) and put back in the mouth
        (<a href="/treatment/surgery/missing-teeth">re-implanted</a>);</li>
    <li>if the pulp is exposed during a deep filling;</li>
    <li>if a hole in the tooth (due to tooth wear or a cavity/decay)
        is deep and bacteria reach the nerve;</li>
    <li>rarely movement of a tooth due to braces.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the nerve becomes inflamed, you might experience some sensitivity
    or tooth ache. Eventually, the nerve will start to die, often
    causing a more severe, constant pain and an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>    might develop. Once the pulp is dead, the space it is in
    can become filled with bacteria, meaning the infection doesn’t
    clear up by itself.</p>
<p>The tooth might have to be removed, or your dentist might be
    able to offer you a root canal treatment. This involves cleaning
    out the dead pulp and filling up the hollow space with rubber,
    to block out any more bacteria from entering. Different teeth
    have a different number of ‘canals’, there can be four or
    more pulp chambers to clean in one tooth. The tooth might
    be weak from having the inside cleaned out and it is important
    that no more bacteria can creep in to the tooth from the
    top, therefore a ‘crown’ might be recommended to cover and
    seal the tooth.</p>
<p>The common steps for a root canal treatment are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>images – <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiographs</a>        will usually be taken to assess the shape of the pulp
        space and the length of the root, as this cannot be seen
        by looking in the mouth;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">anaesthesia</a>        - the tooth will be numbed before treatment to make it
        comfortable for you;</li>
    <li>‘rubber dam’ - usually, the tooth will be poked through a
        hole in a rubber sheet which sits over your mouth. You
        can breathe through this but it stops any of the disinfectant
        chemicals going in to your mouth and stops bacteria from
        your mouth getting in to the tooth;</li>
    <li>access - usually, a small hole is drilled in the top of the
        tooth so the dentist can see the pulp and clean inside
        it;</li>
    <li>cleaning - chemicals and small files are used to clean the
        dead pulp out, more images may be taken to check the
        files are in the right place and a small machine can
        be used to alert the dentist as to when the files are
        at the tip of the tooth;</li>
    <li>root canal filling - the clean, hollow space is filled with
        a rubber material to block bacteria out;</li>
    <li>final restoration - a filling or crown is placed to seal
        the top of the tooth and protect it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the files being used are very thin and delicate (Figure
    1), sometimes they can break inside the tooth. This is uncommon
    but does reduce the success of treatment. Microscopic gaps
    in the rubber and underneath the final crown/filling can
    mean bacteria get back in to the space and cause another
    infection. Although a re-root canal treatment might be possible,
    the chance of it being successful is lower.</p>
