<p>Postoperative problems affecting the floor of the mouth include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">blockage of the submandibular gland(s)</a>,
        leading to obstructive symptoms and swelling in the upper
        neck (most likely caused by damage to the submandibular
        duct)</li>
    <li>damage to the lingual nerve, leading to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">dysaesthesia</a>        (most likely caused by crush, diathermy (heat damage)
        or cutting a terminal branch of the lingual nerve)</li>
    <li>restricted movement of the tongue, leading to <a href="/help/oral-food/texture-adaption">problems with eating</a>        and <a href="/help/salt">speaking</a> (most likely caused
        by scarring or tethering of the otherwise stretchy floor
        of the mouth)</li>
    <li>inability to wear dentures due to loss of lingual sulcus
        (groove between teeth and surrounding tissues) (most
        likely caused by similar conditions to the above)</li>
    <li>bleeding (most likely caused by the fragile large superficial
        veins in the floor of the mouth)</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">damage to salivary glands</a>        , can result in formation of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">ranula</a>        (most likely caused by damage to the sublingual duct)</li>
    <li>exposure of root(s) of tooth / teeth, causing dentine sensitivity
        pain (most likely caused by retraction of lingual gingivae
        (gum tissue on the tongue-facing side of teeth)).</li>
</ul>
