<p>Cracks or chips of the enamel layer do not heal and damage to
    the enamel layer is permanent.</p>
<p>A broken or chipped tooth may or may not be painful but a sharp
    broken surface is likely to irritate or hurt the tongue and/or
    other soft tissue in the mouth. A dentist is able to repair
    this quickly and effectively (usually in a single visit)
    using material called composite and a technique known as
    acid-etching.</p>
<p>A broken tooth is more likely to be painful if the pulp (containing
    the nerve of the tooth) is damaged or the (innervated) dentine
    layer of the tooth is exposed. In this case the procedure
    carried out by the dentist may take more than one visit.
    If the dentine needs to be protected, a combined restoration
    as described above may be possible if the dentine is protected.</p>
<p>More extensive damage may necessitate removal of the dental pulp
    by <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">root canal extirpation</a>    and filling followed by post and core crown restoration.
    This requires several visits and several weeks or even months
    to be completed.</p>
