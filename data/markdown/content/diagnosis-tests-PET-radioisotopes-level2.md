<p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a diagnostic scanning technique
    that uses a particular type of radioactive decay (positron
    emission) to produce three-dimensional images (tomographs)
    of parts or all of the body. Generally PET monitors the difference
    of the uptake of a particular radioisotope in different body
    tissues. The radioisotopes are incorporated in suitable ‘transport’
    chemicals (radiotracers) that distribute the radioisotope
    over the body. The most common type of clinical PET scan
    relies on the body’s metabolism of glucose (a sugar) in conjunction
    with the positron emission of the radioactive isotope <sup>18</sup>F.</p>
<p>The most common clinical application of this type of PET scan
    is in oncology, in looking for the presence or absence of
    malignant tumours and/or metastases and monitoring the effects
    of treatments.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-works-in-principle">How it works in principle</h1>
<p>Positron emission (sometimes called β<sup>+</sup> decay) is a
    type of radioactive decay. A proton in the unstable nucleus
    of a radioactive isotope converts to a neutron, resulting
    in the emission of a positron and a neutrino. A positron
    is an unstable particle, something like an anti-electron:
    it has the same mass as an electron but carries a positive
    charge, rather than the negative charge of an electron. When
    a positron and an electron collide they essentially wipe
    each other out and by doing so they emit two gamma-ray (high
    energy) photons which travel in opposite directions. It is
    these gamma rays that are registered and ‘counted’ by the
    PET scanner.</p>
<p>Fluorine is one of the chemical elements of which a radioactive
    isotope can be manufactured that emits positrons. The normal,
    stable fluorine isotope is <sup>19</sup>F (fluorine is one
    of the few elements in the periodic table of the elements
    that naturally occurs as only one isotope), the non-naturally
    occurring fluorine isotope <sup>18</sup>F is a radioisotope
    that emits positrons. The half-life of <sup>18</sup>F is
    roughly two hours, so it is a fairly short-lived isotope.</p>
<p>Producing <sup>18</sup>F requires access to a cyclotron or a
    linear particle accelerator. A common process to make <sup>18</sup>F
    starts from a sample of water where the water molecules are
    all labelled with the (stable) <sup>18</sup>O oxygen isotope,
    <sup>18</sup>OH<sub>2</sub>. These water molecules are bombarded
    by accelerated protons (H<sup>+</sup> ions). These collisions
    give <sup>18</sup>F<sup>-</sup> ions dissolved in water.</p>
<p>Once the relatively short-lived <sup>18</sup>F isotopes are produced
    in this form, there is only little time for specialised chemical
    synthesis in which the <sup>18</sup>F isotopes are incorporated
    as radioactive labels into a glucose molecule. Figure 1 compares
    the normal glucose molecule (left) with its 2-deoxy-2[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroglucose
    counterpart, FDG (right) that is commonly used in PET scans
    as the radiotracer.</p>

</figure>
<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to first synthesize FDG and
    then irradiate the chemical to produce the radioactive <sup>18</sup>F
    label as irradiation in the accelerator or cyclotron would
    destroy the glucose molecules. Given the relatively short
    half-life of <sup>18</sup>F, it is obvious that running PET
    scans is quite a logistical challenge and exact timing and
    booking is essential for a successful operation of such a
    scanning facility (you can contribute to the success of such
    a facility by arriving on time for your appointment). It
    is also obvious that PET scans are a fairly expensive scanning
    technique, when taking all underlying processes into account.</p>
<p>Before your PET scan you will be given a fairly small dose of
    FDG. You will be asked to quietly wait for about an hour,
    to give your body’s metabolism undisturbed time to pick up
    the <sup>18</sup>F-labelled glucose molecules and distribute
    them around the body. You will probably also have been asked
    not to eat for several hours before the scan and for people
    with diabetes special considerations about this glucose (sugar)
    radiotracer need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>The contrast in images derived from PET scans originates from
    the difference in uptake of glucose by different organs and
    body tissues. For example, the cells in the liver and brain
    have a high rate of uptake of glucose, and so do the cells
    in many malignant tumours. This can be problematic in interpreting
    the scans and only radiologists with special additional training
    interpret PET/CT scans. Once the <sup>18</sup>F-labelled
    glucose is incorporated into a cell, it cannot be metabolised
    any further as normal glucose would be in the cell cycle.
    Accordingly, the amount of radiotracer detected gives a measure
    of the glucose <em>uptake</em> by the metabolic activity
    of the different organs and tissues from the snapshot taken
    by the PET scanner.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which PET scans provide data from which three-dimensional
    body images can be constructed is different from those in
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a> or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    scans: PET collects data about a body <em>function</em>,
    for example the different uptake of glucose by different
    organs and body tissues and thus monitors a metabolic process.
    Both CT and MRI scans give information about the <em>structure</em>    of different body parts and tissues. The spatial resolution
    of PET images is not as good as that in CT or MRI scans but
    PET offers unique and complementary information.</p>
<h1 id="is-it-safe">Is it safe?</h1>
<p>Yes; the amount of high-energy radiation you receive from a PET
    scan is similar to the radiation dose of a typical <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scan</a>.
    A single such scan is extremely unlikely to do any harm but
    any use of high energy (ionising) radiation always should
    be subject to a careful risk / benefit analysis, especially
    when repeatedly such scans are carried out. FDG is a harmless
    chemical.</p>
<h1 id="how-long-will-it-take">How long will it take?</h1>
<p>The overall procedure may stretch your patience a little. After
    you have been given the radioactively labelled glucose, you
    will have to wait quietly for about an hour for the labelled
    glucose molecules to be transported to every corner of your
    body. The scan itself will also take some time, some 20 minutes
    or so, and you will have to be able to keep still and lie
    quite flat during the scan so that clear images can be recorded.
    The exact duration of a scan, or series of scans, depends
    on the kind of tissue and the parts of the body being investigated.</p>
<p>The main reason why it takes quite some time to collect the data
    for a complete PET scan is the need to have a good enough
    (with a fine enough grid of sampling points) set of data
    that afterwards can be converted into a good-quality three-dimensional
    image; a good quality image provides good resolution and
    good contrast.</p>
<h1 id="does-it-hurt">Does it hurt?</h1>
<p>No; a PET scan is a painless procedure. However, some people
    find confinement in any kind of scanner, especially <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    or PET, a little claustrophobic. The best advice really is
    to relax and ignore these environments as best you can –
    it is not in any way dangerous, just not particularly ‘nice’.
    After your PET scan is finished you may be asked to wait
    for a few more minutes while your scan data are roughly checked
    to ensure that the data are of good technical quality and
    can be properly processed and interpreted later on (to avoid
    that you may have to come back for another scan just because
    the scan data were not quite good enough first time round).</p>
