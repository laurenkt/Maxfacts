<p>Postoperative problems affecting the floor of the mouth can be
    remedied as follows</p>
<ul>
    <li>blockage of the sublingual gland(s): <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/getting-started">excision of the damaged sublingual salivary glands</a></li>
    <li>damage to the lingual nerve: repair may require
        <ul>
            <li>surgical exploration of the damage, followed by removal
                of scar tissue <a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies">neurolysis</a>Â </li>
            <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies">primary repair</a>                after excision of the damaged section, or</li>
            <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies/more-info">nerve grafting</a>                (from leg (sural nerve) or great auricular nerve
                (in the neck below the ear))</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>restricted movement of the tongue: repair to achieve improved
        movement may require a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin graft or flap</a></li>
    <li>loss of sulcus: repair may either require building up jaw
        structure (by bone grafts of synthetic bone materials)
        [treatment-surgery-implants-level1] or <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/getting-started">skin grafting</a>        to improve the soft tissue structure</li>
    <li>bleeding: stopping the bleed may require the application
        of pressure, or <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy</a>,
        the application of electrically or chemically created
        heat to cauterise small vessels</li>
    <li>damaged salivary glands: repair will most likely involve
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/getting-started">excision of the damaged salivary gland(s)</a></li>
    <li>exposure of root(s) of tooth / teeth: no fix available, symptomatic
        treatment (for example strontium or fluoride ion containing
        toothpaste for sensitive teeth or adhesive restorative
        cements).</li>
</ul>
