<p>Similar to the causes of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">necrosis (cell death) in bone</a>,
    a variety of conditions ranging from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">unusual immune responses</a>    (such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a>,
    cardiovascular conditions, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">unwanted effects of medications</a>    through to exposure to <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">high-energy radiation</a>    can cause necrosis of soft tissues.</p>
<p>Soft tissue necrosis can affect the skin, including the deep
    layers of skin, the mucosa (such as the lining of the mouth)
    and generally all soft tissues and organs in the body. Affected
    skin may initially show painful signs of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>,
    before the area turns gradually dark and fluid-filled blisters
    (bullae) develop, eventually the dead tissue turns black
    and the necrotic region is no longer painful because the
    peripheral nerves have also stopped working. Necrosis of
    the (oral) mucosa follows a similar pattern. Â </p>
<p>Medications used in radical <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>,
    including <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiangiogenic">antiangiogenic substances</a>    (substances that block the growth of blood vessels; a well-known
    example of such a drug is bevacizumab, used in the treatment
    of a range of malignancies), cause damage to the oral mucosa,
    ranging from inflammation and ulcers to severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">mucositis</a>    and necrosis.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</a> applied
    to the head and neck region, in particular radical irradiation
    with high doses and especially combined with <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    can cause <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaws</a>    and other target bones. Skin in the irradiated area, the
    oral mucosa and other specialised soft tissues, in particular
    the salivary glands, in the head and neck region are all
    vulnerable to long-term damage by exposure high-energy radiation;
    this damage may include soft tissue necrosis with or without
    osteoradionecrosis of the jaws.</p>
