<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the front of
    the neck include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars. Unlike in the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/neck-back">back of the neck</a>        these are easy to see and may benefit from further
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">surgical repair</a> or other scar revision.</li>
    <li>Limitation of movement, including limitation of movement
        of the hyoid bone (at the root of the tongue, in the
        front of the neck). <a href="/help/physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</a>        and self-help in the form of regular <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/neck">special exercises</a>        will help to alleviate such problems.</li>
    <li>Stoma after laryngectomy (removal of the voice box). See
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/larynx">treatments for postoperative problems affecting the larynx</a>.</li>
    <li>Lymphoedema (caused by missing lymph glands). <a href="/help/physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</a>        and self-help in the form of regular <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/lymphoedema">special exercises</a>        will help to alleviate such problems. Â </li>
</ul>
