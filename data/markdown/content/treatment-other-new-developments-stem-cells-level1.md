<p>Stem cells are unspecialised cells which have the
    potential to become a number of different cell types
    through a process known as differentiation. They play a
    key role in both development (embryonic stem cells) and
    maintenance (adult stem cells) of a healthy body. The
    ability to differentiate into different cell types
    suggests great therapeutic potential, for example in
    replacement of damaged or dysfunctional cells and
    tissues. In some organisms (such as newts), stem cells
    can even replace whole organs and limbs. On the other
    hand, some types of stem cells also play a role in the
    development and <a href="/treatment-surgery-tumour-metastases-level3">recurrence</a>
    of malignancies.</p>
<p>There have already been some successes in the use of stem
    cells in the treatment of human diseases such as some
    forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy/more-info">leukaemia</a>,
    where healthy stem cells found in blood (haematopoietic
    stem cells) play a role as an important treatment
    modality. As powerful tools for tissue restoration and
    maintenance, manipulation of stem cells could have
    applications in many other aspects of disease management
    and treatment. In oral and maxillofacial surgery,
    several promising applications have been identified, for
    example in the repair of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">clefts</a>
    and other <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">major
        defects</a>. Before we discuss a number of these <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/stem-cells/detailed">attractive
        future targets for stem cell treatments</a> and
    other key aspects of stem cells, we briefly sketch some
    key properties and types of stem cells below.</p>
<h1 id="key-properties-of-stem-cells">Key properties of stem cells</h1>
<p><strong>Lack of specialisation</strong> is one of the key
    properties of stem cells, along with their ability to be
    converted (differentiate) into a variety of cell types.
    Differentiation usually occurs in steps, forming a
    series of cells which have committed to the
    differentiation process, but are yet to fully specialise
    and can often differentiate into a variety of different
    cells themselves (known as ‘progenitor cells’). An
    example is the series of progenitor cells required
    before finally forming a red blood cell (Figure 1).</p>

        of a red blood cell amongst other differentiation
        pathways, showing the few progenitors and the final
        cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Potency</strong> of stem cells is a measure of
    their ability to differentiate into different cell
    types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>totipotent stem cells can form any living tissue or
        even whole organisms;</li>
    <li>pluripotent stem cells can form any living tissue
        but not whole organisms, as they cannot form the
        supportive tissues for embryos (the placenta and the
        umbilical cord);</li>
    <li>multipotent stem cells are able to form a limited
        number of cell types, usually related to the area of
        the body in which these stem cells reside.</li>
</ul>
<p>Totipotent and pluripotent stem cells are found in early
    human development. After fertilisation of egg cells, the
    cells are very briefly totipotent, only up to the stage
    where we are made of four cells. Cells from a specific
    part of the blastocyst, a structure found before embryo
    formation, are pluripotent (see below). Stem cells found
    in adult tissue are multipotent (Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-stem-cells-level1-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Schematic
        illustration of the potency of different types of
        stem cells.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Self-renewal</strong> is another key stem cell
    property, the ability to divide to form more stem cells.
    There are different models of how stem cell division
    occurs, and it is thought that different models apply to
    different organs. In the ‘asymmetric division’ model, a
    stem cell divides to form one other stem cell, and one
    cell that will go on to differentiate. In the
    ‘independent choice’ model, each daughter cell could
    become either a stem cell or a differentiated cell
    (Figure 3). On a more philosophical note, the ability of
    self-renewal is actually the crucial aspect of a widely
    accepted definition of life as any self-maintaining
    (chemical) system that interacts with its environment
    and shares information.</p>

<h1 id="key-types-of-stem-cells">Key types of stem cells</h1>
<p>Stem cells can mostly be divided into two broad
    categories: <strong>embryonic stem cells</strong> and
    <strong>adult stem cells</strong>. Embryonic stem cells
    are the pluripotent cells located in the blastocyst (see
    above, Figure 2). Ethical concerns over use of embryos
    have left adult stem cells as the main focus of stem
    cell research. For example, some people and religions
    take the start of life as the point of conception, hence
    the use of embryos is seen by some as an intended and
    wasteful loss of life.</p>
<p>Adult stem cells are multipotent stem cells located in
    specific tissues which require renewal. They are vital
    for maintenance of a healthy body, located in a broad
    range of tissues and organs (Figure 4). Being
    multipotent, they can differentiate into a limited set
    of cells, usually only the cells required for the
    surrounding tissues. Tissue and cell restoration are
    vital for our maintenance, so there are many types of
    adult stem cells: haematopoietic stem cells form new
    blood cells; epidermal stem cells form new skin cells;
    mesenchymal stem cells form new bone, cartilage, muscle
    and fat cells; intestinal stem cells form new cells of
    the lining of the intestine; the list goes on.</p>

        cell sources and their potency. Top left: totipotent
        stem cells; top right: pluripotent stem cells;
        bottom: different adult stem cell types.

</figure>
<p>Induced pluripotent stem cells are another type of stem
    cells, not part of either adult or embryonic stem cell
    categories. They are referred to as ‘induced’ because
    they are not naturally occurring, instead are formed by
    manipulation of regular adult cells through the addition
    of a set of ‘transcription factors’. Transcription
    factors are small proteins which affect gene
    transcription, the process in which information from DNA
    is converted into a readable form (messenger RNA), from
    which other proteins can be produced. Addition of the
    transcription factors to the adult cell causes the cell
    to produce a different set of proteins, causing the cell
    to have very different properties. The adult cell is
    therefore converted from fully differentiated to
    pluripotent, able to differentiate into different cell
    types. Induced pluripotent stem cells present similar
    qualities to those of embryonic stem cells, without the
    associated ethical concerns. In addition, induced
    pluripotent stem cells present an opportunity to avoid
    the problem of rejection of transplanted stem cells or
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy/more-info">graft versus host
        disease</a> (allografts or allotransplants; that is
    tissue from a genetically non-identical donor of the
    same species). If healthy adult stem cells can be
    obtained and made pluripotent, they could be extracted
    from the patient themselves (an autograft, a
    self-donation), so the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune
        system</a> does not see them as a foreign body, thus
    avoiding rejection problems.</p>
