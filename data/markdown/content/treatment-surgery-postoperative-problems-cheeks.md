<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the cheeks include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars. Most <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">facial surgical scars</a>        are designed to lie in natural skin folds or resting
        skin tension lines, which allows them to be very effectively
        hidden. If there are visible scars, conventional <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">scar revision techniques</a>        can be used for corrections.</li>
    <li>Large areas of skin loss may require <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction with flaps or grafts</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>        if underlying nerves (infraorbital, zygomatico-facial
        and zygomatico-temporal branches of the trigeminal nerve)
        are damaged are treated in the same way as many other
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies">treatment approaches for neuropathies</a>.</li>
    <li>Hypo- and hyperpigmentation of <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin grafts</a>        and/or scars may be helped by cosmetics for camouflage,
        or by surgical dermatography (medical tattooing).</li>
    <li>Buccal mucosa. In very rare cases such as syndromes in people
        who have no sensation of pain, mouth-guards made of silicone
        have been used.</li>
</ul>
