<p>The bone marrow (spongy tissue inside some bones) is the cradle
    of the various different types of mature blood cells. All
    the distinct types of blood cells originate from the haematopoietic
    stem cells (blood stem cells) in the bone marrow (see Figure
    1).</p>

<p>Haematological (blood) malignancies originate in the stem cells
    in the bone marrow and can be categorised according to the
    types of blood cells that are affected.</p>
<p>Haematological malignancies that start in the <strong>lymphoblastic line</strong>    and affect the T and B lymphocytes include acute lymphoblastic
    leukaemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), multiple
    myeloma and lymphomas. Lymphomas mainly manifest in the lymphatic
    system, in the lymph nodes.</p>
<p>Haematological malignancies that start in the <strong>myeloid line</strong>    and affect the red blood cells, blood platelets and some
    white blood cells include acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML),
    chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and some other disorders
    such as myelodysplastic syndromes and myelofibrosis.</p>
<p>A maxillofacial clinic is not the place for treatment of malignant
    blood disorders in general but several of the haematological
    malignancies give rise to signs and symptoms that will be
    typically investigated in a maxillofacial clinic. In fact,
    it may happen that such signs and symptoms will lead to a
    diagnosis of a haematological malignancy initially in a maxillofacial
    clinic, which will refer you directly to a haematological
    oncologist.</p>
