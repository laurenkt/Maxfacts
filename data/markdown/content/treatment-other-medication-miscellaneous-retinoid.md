<p>The term retinoid captures a whole class of chemicals, all sharing
    one common structural motif (Figure 1, top) with many variations.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-retinoid-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Top: the generic structural motif
        of retinoids; middle: the retinal molecule (involved
        in the vision process; retinal and some of its derivatives
        are embedded in a large protein molecule in the eye (rhodopsin);
        when exposed to visible light, the conformation of the
        double bonds in these small molecules changes and provides
        a ‘byte’ of information in the visual process); bottom:
        β-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A, found in the pigments
        of many colourful fruits and vegetables).</figcaption>

<p>Apart from the natural role of retinoids in the vision process,
    as precursors for vitamin A, as agents in cell differentiation
    and proliferation (including bones) and an involvement in
    the regular function of the immune system, there are several
    uses of retinoids in medicine or as a component in cosmetic
    products.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment-other-medication-delivery-level3">Topical</a>    retinoid preparations are used to treat some skin conditions
    such as severe acne or psoriasis (dry, scaly skin patches),
    and are a component in some ‘anti-aging’ lotions and potions.
    Retinoids in such preparations generate superficial inflammation
    of the skin and activate <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/collagen">collagen</a>    production which inevitably smooths out some fine lines and
    superficial wrinkles. For the effect to persist, the treatment
    has to be continuous (but may also cause severe skin irritation).
    Vitamin A and <i>β</i>-carotene, along with further retinoids
    and other substances, have been suggested as ‘chemoprevention
    agents’ to reduce the transformation risk of some persistent
    oral, pre-malignant lesions (for example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia/more-info">oral leukoplakia</a>)
    into oral malignancies. The evidence for the efficacy of
    such agents is poor.</p>
