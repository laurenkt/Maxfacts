<p>Postoperative problems affecting the femur (long bone in the
    thigh) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rarely used for reconstructive purposes in maxillofacial
        surgery.</li>
    <li>The periosteum (dense layer of tissue enveloping the bone)
        has been used as a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">vascularised flap</a>        in managing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis</a>.
        Only known problem is a scar on the thigh.</li>
    <li>The outer cortex of the distal (bottom end) of the femur
        can be used as a vascularised bone flap. The blood vessels
        used are non-essential to the leg. Pain is minimal and
        no fractures have been reported but the amount of bone
        harvested is very small. The vessels are exceptionally
        short and small, often necessitating <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">intraoral microsurgery</a>.
        Performed in only a handful of specialised centres where
        the head of department has been instrumental in developing
        the technique.</li>
</ul>
