<p>We have separately categorised the most common malignancies
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone cancer</a>, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">mouth cancer</a>,
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">facial skin cancer</a>,
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">salivary gland cancer</a>        affecting the head and neck. Benign tumours of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump">soft tissues</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">hard tissues</a>        are also covered.</p>
<p>Here we discuss some other, rare, presentations of malignancy
    in the head and neck: <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">haematological malignancy</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases from other organs</a>.</p>
<p>Another, even much rarer group of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other">miscellaneous tumours</a>    are described for completeness.</p>
