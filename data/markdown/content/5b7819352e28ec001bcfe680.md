<p>The diverse group of craniofacial anomalies comprises some of
    the most common birth defects in humans. Amongst these, a
    variety of jaw disproportion and cleft lip and/or palate
    conditions are the most common. These conditions are discussed
    in two separate sections:</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about jaw disproportion, this
        information is in our sections about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-disproportion">diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">treatment</a>        of jaw disproportion conditions. </p>

    <p>If you’d like to read more about cleft lip and/or palate,
        this information is in our sections about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/cleft-lip-palate">treatment</a>        of cleft lip and/or palate conditions.</p>
</aside>
<p>This leaves us with a discussion of malformations affecting the
    skull and brain. All of these congenital craniofacial anomalies
    can be spontaneous developmental disorders or part of an
    inherited genetic syndrome (see below).</p>
<h1 id="craniosynostosis">Craniosynostosis</h1>
<p>The function of the skull (the cranium) is to protect the delicate
    brain tissue. This protective role requires finely matched
    size and shape of the hard shell and its soft content. This
    requirement in turn necessitates finely tuned sequences of
    development and growth of brain and skull bones, before and
    after birth.</p>
<p>Nature has engineered a clever solution to accommodate growth
    of the brain while providing protection for it with a hard
    shell. Early in life, the skull is made up by bone compartments
    (the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital and sphenoid
    bones) that are fairly flexibly connected by soft interfaces
    (sutures; see top row in Figure 1). Around the time of birth,
    the human skull is relatively small in order to enable easy
    passage through the birth canal. After birth there is an
    onset of rapid growth of the brain. The sutures of the skull
    permit corresponding skull growth perpendicular to their
    main direction. The sutures are geometrically perfectly arranged
    to allow for overall harmonious brain and facial growth. </p>
<p>Ongoing brain growth is the main factor that keeps the sutures
    open. Lack of soft-tissue growth signals biochemically that
    the soft sutures should fuse and harden, then turn into regular
    bone (ossification). This effect is desired once the brain
    has stopped growing in its normal developmental processes.
    It ensures mutually perfectly matched size and shape of brain
    and skull. In practice, fusion of the sutures is a gradual
    process correlated with the rate of growth of the brain and
    is complete by the age of 6 to 8 years. </p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-craniofacial-anomalies-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Sketches of the top views of the
        skull and its sutures. Top row: normal situation; the
        following rows illustrate the distorted growth resulting
        from some premature suture-fusion scenarios; the prematurely
        fused sutures are indicated in blue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Craniosynostosis is the result of one or several of the sutures
    fusing prematurely. It is called a primary craniosynostosis
    if it is not related to any other problems. It is called
    a secondary craniosynostosis if it is associated with some
    underlying condition. Secondary craniosynostoses are the
    more common. Microcephaly (an unusually small head at birth)
    is usually a strong indication for the presence of secondary
    craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis may be simple (only one
    suture involved) or compound (multiple sutures involved).
    When only one suture is involved, usually the functions of
    brain and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">cranial nerves</a>    are not affected.</p>
<p>Early fusion can affect the sutures of the bone of the skull
    base or the vault. In either case, the growth space for the
    brain is hindered and compensatory growth (where possible)
    and distorted cranial and facial growth is the result. Some
    examples of deformities resulting from craniosynostosis of
    a single suture are schematically illustrated in Figure 1
    by showing the effect as seen from a top view:</p>
<ul>
    <li>(posterior) plagiocephaly as shown results from early unilateral
        fusion of the lambdoid suture;</li>
    <li>trigonocephaly results from early fusion of the metopic suture;</li>
    <li>scaphocephaly results from early fusion of the sagittal suture
        (the most common synostosis);</li>
    <li>brachycephaly as shown results from early bilateral fusion
        of the coronal sutures.</li> </ul>
<p>Multiple suture involvement tends to give rise to brachycephaly.
    The typical compensatory growth following fusion of the sagittal
    suture leads to an elongated shape of the head and bulging
    of the skull at the front and back.</p>
<p>Effects of craniosynostosis depend on the site(s) and extent
    of premature fusion; in more severe cases immediate and/or
    early paediatric <a href="/treatment/surgery/craniofacial-anomalies">craniofacial surgery</a>    may be required. The anomalies can have significant effects
    on cranial and facial growth (see Figure 2). Given the developmental
    course of events, craniofacial anomalies are usually diagnosed
    at birth or shortly afterwards.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-craniofacial-anomalies-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Complex craniosynostoses.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Restriction of growth of the skull vault can lead to a rise in
    intracranial pressure. This requires early intervention to
    decompensate and release pressure in order to prevent damage,
    for example to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">cranial nerves</a>    and potentially leading to loss of vision. Another neurological
    problem associated with craniosynostosis is a possible build-up
    of cerebrospinal fluid (hydrocephalus) that may necessitate
    the implementation of a shunt to reduce pressure and channel
    off surplus fluid. Craniosynostosis may also be associated
    with the displacement of the lower part of the brain (Chiari
    I malformation) toward the upper region of the neck spinal
    canal, causing build-up of pressure and ensuing damage in
    that region; urgent surgical intervention (removal of bone)
    to reduce pressure may be necessary.</p>
<p>Complex craniosynostoses typically occur as part of various craniofacial
    syndromes (see below). These conditions usually require early
    initial interventions such as securing the airway, combined
    with subsequent surgeries later in life.  </p>
<h1 id="craniofacial-microsomia">Craniofacial microsomia</h1>
<p>This is the second most common craniofacial anomaly, with a prevalence
    of approximately 1 in 5000 births. It is a congenital defect
    characterised by lack of both hard and soft tissues on the
    affected side of the face. It typically affects the mandibular
    ramus (the upward pointing branch of the lower jaw) and external
    ear (microtia). The majority of cases are unilateral, approximately
    20 % of craniofacial microsomias are bilateral (affecting
    both sides of the face). In most cases craniofacial microsomia
    is associated with further malformations from underlying
    craniofacial syndromes (see below). Because of these common
    associations and a very wide range of suspected and reported
    chromosomal aberrations and other abnormalities, to date
    no specific genetic mutation has been identified as causal
    for microtia and microsomia.</p>
<p>A wide spectrum of ear and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">cranial nerve</a>    deformities is found. There may be mild abnormalities of
    the ear, or complete absence of the outer ear. In most unilateral
    cases of microtia hearing is normal on the non-affected side.
    Facial asymmetries may be mild and may be satisfactorily
    managed later with orthodontic treatment (such as hybrid
    functional appliances) alone. At the other end of the spectrum
    there may be significant defects such as complete absence
    or destruction of the mandible and/or temporomandibular joint
    (the joint connecting the lower jaw and the temporal bone).
    Such significant defects will typically require <a href="/treatment/surgery/craniofacial-anomalies">surgical intervention(s)</a>    often initially to secure the airway, later in order to restore
    functionality with regard to speech and oral food intake.
    Optimal timing of such <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>    is essential for long-term success.</p>
<h1 id="positional-malformations">Positional malformations</h1>
<p>It is common for newborns to have a slightly strange head shape
    right after birth. Such minor distortions can arise from
    lack of space in the uterus or from the birth process. This
    all takes care of itself after a short while, usually within
    a year. </p>
<p>Sometimes a distortion of the head shape develops over time,
    with an appearance similar to plagiocephaly or brachycephaly
    (see Figure 1 above) but in the absence of any craniosynostosis.
    This is known as ‘positional moulding’ or ‘deformational
    plagiocephaly/brachycephaly’. It occurs if an infant spends
    much time either constantly lying on one side (plagiocephaly-like
    appearance), or on their back with the head on a hard surface
    (brachycephaly-like appearance). This kind of distortion
    is usually self-correcting over time, approximately two years,
    but recovery is helped by varying the positioning of the
    head of an infant. </p>
<h1 id="craniofacial-syndromes">Craniofacial syndromes</h1>
<p>Craniofacial syndromes are genetic syndromes that can be isolated
    (spontaneous mutations) or inherited conditions. The associated
    abnormalities include a very wide variety of conditions and
    disorders, with approximately 700 such syndromes known (some
    of which are very rare). The disorders are not limited to
    conditions solely affecting the head (including craniosynostosis,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft lip and/or palate</a>,
    craniofacial microsomia, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">neuropathies of the cranial nerves</a>,
    deficits of brain function) but may include further malformations
    of other parts of the body, often affecting the limbs, hands
    and fingers, as well as malformations of the heart and digestive
    system. </p>
<p>The embryonal development of head and face is a truly complicated
    course of events, involving multiple finely tuned cascades
    of biochemically / genetically encoded signalling, and so
    on. This delicacy of an amazing developmental process exposes
    the maxillofacial region to the effects of minor genetic
    mishaps and developmental disturbances (another example of
    such vulnerability to minor developmental disturbances is
    the common occurrence of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/detailed">cysts</a>    in the maxillofacial region). In the past, statistical analysis
    of family traits and similar investigations had only limited
    success in elucidating the pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms
    for craniofacial syndromes. The advent of genetic screening
    (see below) and other advances in molecular biology a couple
    of decades ago are now making a big difference in learning
    more about such conditions and their causes. Over the past
    few years several single and combined genes and their involvement
    in developmental disorders have been identified.</p>
<p>The most common (perhaps better termed: the least rare) craniofacial
    syndromes are summarised below; the severity of signs and
    symptoms varies widely among individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Apert syndrome</strong> (autosomal dominant inheritance)
    occurs approximately in 1 : 75.000 births. The syndrome involves
    multiple prematurely fused sutures (coronal, sagittal, lambdoid),
    facial deformities including hypertelorism (wide eyes) and
    syndactyly (malformations of hands and feet). The syndrome
    is associated with a single gene mutation (FGFR2; involved
    with the physiology of bone formation). </p>
<p><strong>Carpenter syndrome</strong> (autosomal recessive inheritance)
    is rare, with less than 100 cases reported in the literature.
    The syndrome involves multiple fused sutures with severe
    skull and facial deformities, malformations of hands and
    feet, cardiovascular deformities, skeletal abnormalities
    (such as scoliosis or deformed knee joints), early childhood
    onset of obesity, vision problems, and may include mental
    retardation. Mutations of two genes (RAB23 and MEGF8) have
    been associated with the syndrome; both genes are involved
    in various protein syntheses.</p>
<p><strong>Crouzon syndrome</strong> (autosomal dominant inheritance)
    is reported to occur approximately in 1 : 63.000 births.
    The syndrome involves the premature fusion of the coronal
    and/or sagittal sutures. It leads to deformities of the midface,
    and vision and hearing problems. The syndrome may also lead
    to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft lip and/or palate</a>    in conjunction with an underdeveloped maxilla (upper jaw)
    and abnormal dentition. The syndrome is associated with a
    single gene mutation (FGFR2). </p>
<p><strong>Muenke syndrome</strong> (autosomal dominant inheritance)
    is reported to occur approximately in 1 : 30.000 births.
    The syndrome involves the premature fusion of the coronal
    suture. It leads to deformities of the midface and skull
    and is occasionally associated with an abnormally large head
    (macrocephaly). There may be hearing loss and delayed development
    or learning difficulties. The syndrome is associated with
    a single gene mutation (FGFR3; involved with the physiology
    of bone and brain tissue formation); some people who carry
    this gene mutation have no signs and symptoms of the syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>Nager syndrome</strong> (unclear genetic inheritance;
    seems to occur more commonly as a spontaneous mutation) is
    a rare condition, only few cases (less than 100) have been
    reported in the literature. The syndrome involves micrognathia
    (underdeveloped lower jaw), malar hypoplasia (underdeveloped
    cheek bones) and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft palate</a>,
    leading to feeding and (potentially serious) breathing problems
    resulting from a blocked airway (due to micrognathia). There
    may be further deformities, mainly affecting the hands and
    fingers and the skeleton of the limbs. The syndrome seems
    to be associated (in some cases) with a gene mutation (SF3B4;
    mutation leading to faulty proteins involved in the formation
    of bone tissue) but there may be multifactorial causes, including
    environmental effects and mutations of further genes.</p>
<p><strong>Pfeiffer syndrome</strong> (autosomal dominant inheritance)
    occurs approximately in 1 : 100.000 births. The syndrome
    involves multiple prematurely fused sutures. It leads to
    skull and facial deformities, hypertelorism, hearing loss
    and dental abnormalities. In addition, the syndrome leads
    to brachydactyly (short fingers and toes) and sometimes syndactyly.
    There are different subtypes of the syndrome, with variable
    degrees of severity of signs and symptoms. The syndrome is
    commonly associated with a single gene mutation (FGFR2). </p>
<p><strong>Pierre Robin sequence </strong>(autosomal dominant inheritance,
    but more commonly a spontaneous mutation) occurs approximately
    in 1 : 10.000 – 15.000 births. It can occur as an isolated
    syndrome, or in combination with other syndromes (such as
    Stickler syndrome, see below).  The syndrome is called a
    sequence because of the sequence of developmental events
    leading to the specific deformities: micrognathia (underdeveloped
    lower jaw) causes glossoptosis (misplaced tongue, toward
    the back) which in turn leads to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft palate</a>.
    The deformities can cause difficulties with breathing and
    feeding early in life but growth of the mandible (lower jaw)
    in many children will catch up later and result in normal-sized
    features in the adult.The syndrome is commonly associated
    with a mutation of the SOX9 gene but further genetic causes
    may be involved as well as non-genetic factors. The SOX9
    gene is involved in protein synthesis essential in the development
    of tissues and organs of an embryo.</p>
<p><strong>Seathre-Chotzen</strong> (usually autosomal dominant
    inheritance, but also spontaneous mutation) is estimated
    to occur in 1 : 25.000 – 50.000 births and its severity varies
    widely. The syndrome involves the premature fusion of the
    coronal suture and other cranial malformations. It leads
    to skull and facial deformities, including eyes and eyelids,
    as well as malformations of hands, fingers and toes. Mutation
    of the TWIST1 gene are associated with the syndrome. A faulty
    TWIST1 gene prevents the synthesis of a crucial protein for
    the embryonal development of bones and muscles in the head
    and neck region and the limbs. Not all carriers of the mutated
    TWIST1 gene show features of Seathre-Chotzen syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>Stickler syndrome</strong> (some subtypes of the syndrome
    follow an autosomal dominant, some an autosomal recessive
    inheritance) is estimated to occur in approximately 1 : 10.000
    births. It includes a group of syndromes that in turn all
    include the features of the Pierre Robin sequence (micrognathia,
    glossoptosis, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft palate</a>,
    see above). In addition, Stickler syndrome includes problems
    affecting the eyes such as glaucoma, cataracts, or retinal
    detachment, alongside extreme forms of myopia (short-sightedness)
    and additional problems with hearing loss. The syndrome also
    involves a range of malformations and other abnormalities
    of the skeleton, in particular the spine and joints (including
    scoliosis, kyphosis, hypermobile joints and early onset arthritis).
    Most subtypes of Stickler syndrome are associated with a
    mutation of the COL2A1 gene; defects of this gene prevent
    the formation of regular connective tissues (such as collagen).</p>
<p><strong>Treacher Collins syndrome</strong> (autosomal dominant
    inheritance, but more commonly a spontaneous mutation; there
    is also an autosomal recessive inheritance variety) is estimated
    to occur in approximately 1 : 50.000 births and the severity
    of its signs and symptoms varies greatly. The syndrome mainly
    leads to midface deformities (including malar hypoplasia
    (underdeveloped cheek bones), micrognathia (underdeveloped
    lower jaw) and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft palate</a>,
    hypoplastic sinuses) such that often serious breathing problems
    are caused. There may also be hearing loss from ear deformities,
    but intellectual function is completely normal. Most cases
    of this syndrome are associated with a mutation of the TCOF1
    gene; this gene is an important part of the machinery to
    produce ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which in turn is a crucial
    agent in protein synthesis and cell life-cycles in the body
    in general. Why a lack of rRNA resulting from this genetic
    mutation predominantly affects the facial development is
    not currently understood. </p>
<h1 id="history-examination-and-diagnostic-tests">History, examination and diagnostic tests </h1>
<p>Most craniosynostoses are identified before or at birth and worsen
    over time (whereas positional malformations also worsen over
    time but are absent at the time of birth; minor malformations
    acquired during the birth process do not worsen over time).
    The history of events before, during and after birth usually
    holds some clues about the nature and origin of the problem;
    history in this context also includes the relevant medical
    history of the family as there may be information about possible
    familial / inherited syndromes. </p>
<p>Examination includes all the usual physical examinations and
    measurements typically performed in the assessment of newborns
    and/or young babies and may be completed by a range of imaging
    methods (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray</a> and
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a> provide information about prematurely fused
        sutures and other bone deformities, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI scans</a>        are useful to find out about soft-tissue malformations,
        including Chiari malformation (see above) or other brain
        and nerve abnormalities). Depending on the overall condition,
        ophthalmologists and neurologists may be involved in
        the process. </p>
<p>Genetic screening plays in increasingly important and increasingly
    practical role in investigations of craniofacial malformations.
    The screening process usually includes three generations
    of a family, so can be quite extensive. It may be searching
    for a single particular mutation as well as, more commonly,
    searching more widely for a range of genes and their potential
    abnormalities. Genetic screening provides important information
    about the origin of a condition as an inherited syndrome
    or as resulting from a spontaneous mutation. Genetic information
    thus is important for families in order to understand the
    risk of recurrence for future children, but also to be aware
    of additional health issues and enhanced risks that may be
    associated with a particular existing syndrome. </p>
