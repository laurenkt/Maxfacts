<p>Antiplatelet medications are a group of substances, widely prescribed
    in the prevention and treatment of arterial thrombosis (the
    blocking of a smooth blood flow in the arteries and arterioles).
    They are widely used because cardiovascular diseases (stroke,
    heart attacks, peripheral arterial disease, and other underlying
    conditions) are common potentially serious conditions in
    the western world. For example, pulmonary thrombosis (a clot
    in the lungs) can be a fatal event. Antiplatelet medications
    make a useful contribution in the management and prevention
    of a range of arterial conditions.</p>
<p>The group of medications are called antiplatelet medications
    because they all in some way interfere with the aggregation
    of platelets, the early stages of the formation of a blood
    clot. Clumping / clotting of platelets is the most significant
    contribution to the formation of clots in arteries, hence
    preventing platelets from aggregating is the mechanism to
    treat arterial conditions (the formation of thromboses in
    veins follows slightly different paths and accordingly there
    is another widely used range of medications, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/anticoagulant">anticoagulants</a>,
    for the treatment of venous conditions).</p>
<p>The most commonly used oral antiplatelet medications are</p>
<ul>
    <li>aspirin</li>
    <li>clopidogrel</li>
    <li>prasugrel</li>
    <li>ticagrelor</li>
    <li>dipyridamole.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aspirin in low doses hinders an enzyme that is necessary to initiate
    the formation of a clot (in higher doses aspirin has <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">anti-inflammatory</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesic</a>    properties). Clopidogrel hinders another pathway in the early
    stages of formation of a blood clot. Other antiplatelet medications
    address later stages in the clotting process and tend to
    be stronger suppressors of platelet activity.</p>
<p>A maxillofacial clinic certainly is not the place for the treatment
    of cardiovascular conditions. However, a number of maxillofacial
    patients will be on long-term medication with antiplatelet
    drugs. This can be relevant for maxillofacial treatment planning
    and prescription of medications because all antiplatelet
    (and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a>)
    medications have in common that they <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">interfere with many other medications</a>    and foods.</p>
