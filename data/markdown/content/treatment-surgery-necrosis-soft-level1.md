<p>The treatment options for soft tissue necrosis include:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Surgical removal (débridement) of necrotic tissue and drainage
        of any pus. This is the main mode of acute treatment.</li>
    <li>Surgical removal of necrotic tissue may have to take the
        form of an emergency intervention and in some instances
        may have to be radical (for example, large amounts of
        scalp or facial skin may have to be resected).</li>
    <li>Radical resection of necrotic tissue in the acute phase of
        the underlying condition may necessitate <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">surgical reconstruction</a>        of large defects later on.</li>
    <li>When necrosis is associated with some severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bacterial infections</a>        (in particular <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology"><i>clostridium</i></a>        infections (gas gangrene)), <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">hyperbaric oxygen therapy, HBO</a>        may be beneficial.</li>
    <li>When necrosis is associated with infection(s), more or less
        aggressive and prolonged treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotic agents</a>        (antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral) is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact treatment strategies for soft tissue necrosis depend
    on type, size, location, severity and underlying causes,
    but typically will include one or some of the approaches
