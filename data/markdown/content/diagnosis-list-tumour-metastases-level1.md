<p>The ability to spread and seed new tumour growth at distant body
    sites, away from the original lesion, is a characteristic
    of malignant lesions. The effect and the process are called
    metastasis. This is different from the recurrence of a malignant
    tumour at its original site.</p>
<p>While most primary malignant tumours are able to metastasise,
    the degree and likelihood of spread varies considerably between
    different types of malignancies. For example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">basal cell carcinoma of the skin</a>    very rarely spreads, whereas breast, prostate and lung cancers
    all have a high propensity to develop metastases. Sometimes
    metastases are detected but it is impossible to find and
    identify a primary malignancy; such metastases are called
    metastases of unknown primary or cancer of unknown primary
    (CUP). This can happen if the primary malignancy is too small
    to detect, or has resolved spontaneously but not before causing
    metastasis. Some primary malignancies (in particular cancers
    of the oesophagus (gullet) and bone (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">osteosarcoma</a>)
    and oral cancers (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">squamous cell carcinoma</a>)
    sometimes show so called skip lesions (also known as skip
    metastases) where regions of healthy tissue are interspersed
    with regions of malignant growth.</p>
<p>Different primary malignancies in different organs have different
    preferred locations for establishment and growth of metastases.
    For example, breast and prostate cancers tend to spread to
    bones (including the skull and facial bones) and lung and
    colon cancers to the liver. The establishment of metastases
    can be seen as an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases/more-info">evolutionary process</a>.
    Throughout this overall process there are significant differences
    between regional metastases (for example, metastases from
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oral cancer</a>    to the lymph nodes of the neck) and distant (systemic) metastases
    (for example, metastases from breast cancer to the brain).</p>
<p>Most head &amp; neck malignancies have a relatively low likelihood
    for developing distant metastasis, although more are found
    currently as more oral cancer patients are living with and
    beyond cancer. Lymphatic regional metastasis to the cervical
    nodes (lymph nodes of the neck) occurs in roughly half of
    oral cancer patients.</p>
<p>Malignancies of the scalp skin tend to spread to lymph nodes
    in the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">parotid salivary glands</a>    as well as the neck, the parotid lymph nodes often being
    the first nodes these cancers reach.</p>
<p>Most distant metastases from primary head &amp; neck malignancies
    are found in the lungs and some in bones (regional and distant
    metastases).</p>
<p>Primary malignancies that may lead to distant metastases in the
    head &amp; neck region are breast (bone and soft tissue metastases,
    including brain and eyes) and prostate cancers (bone metastases),
    soft-tissue deposits from some forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">leukaemia</a>,
    bone lesions from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">multiple myeloma</a>    (a primary malignancy affecting the bone marrow) and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">melanoma</a>    (an aggressive and invasive form of skin cancer) may progress
    to a variety of metastatic locations in soft (including brain
    and other nerve tissue) and hard tissues.</p>
<p>The development and growth of metastases from a primary malignancy
    occurs in stages. This process and its underlying mechanisms
    are well investigated (mostly for the most common malignancies)
    and are in parts quite well understood. This underpins the
    so called TNM system (T (<i>t</i>umour), N (lymph <i>n</i>ode),
    M (systemic <i>m</i>etastases)). Using the TNM system all
    these aspects are assessed and staged (their advancement
    is ranked) at diagnosis, leading to an overall assessment
    and rational planning for optimal treatment.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Read more about the TNM system as applied to oral cancer
        on our detailed page about the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">diagnosis of oral cancer</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Unfortunately, the development and growth of distant metastases
    are not yet well enough understood to either prevent or improve
    the <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/metastases">treatment of systemic metastatic disease</a>.
    Curative treatment or treatment with curative intent is very
    rarely undertaken if head &amp; neck cancers have been detected
    systemically. If the rationale is symptom improvement at
    the primary site, this is sometimes called ‘radical treatment
    with palliative intent’. Very clearly a full understanding
    of what is being done and why between patient, carers and
    treating clinicians is essential.</p>
