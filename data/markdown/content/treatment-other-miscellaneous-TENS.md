<p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS, is a
    popular self-help and clinical approach, mainly aiming
    to deal with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">pain
        of all kinds</a>. It is, however, controversial if
    TENS has any clinically significant effects, and if so
    what exactly the effects are. Its popularity is likely
    to originate from the over-the-counter availability of
    affordable, small battery-powered TENS gadgets, ease of
    use, a high probability that no (or: no serious) harm is
    done, and the absence of need for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">systemic
        analgesia</a>. TENS has been reported as stand-alone
    and as supportive treatment modality in pain management.
</p>
<p>The idea behind TENS relates to an effect that most
    people will have experienced themselves. For example, if
    one bumps one’s head, rubbing the painful area seems to
    moderate / relieve the pain. This effect suggests that
    some form of local stimulus can modify the perception of
    pain. Electrical currents are one such type of stimulus
    and are known to be easily deliverable to body areas,
    nerves and other tissues near the surface, through
    intact skin (transcutaneous). This is achieved by
    placing small electrodes on the skin in the appropriate
    area and using a variety of regimens which deliver small
    intensities of electrical current to the area (different
    regimens of duration, amplitudes, frequencies, pulse
    forms and repetition). If there are any benefits to be
    had from TENS, it may make good sense to discuss the
    best use and regimens with a health professional with
    experience in the field instead of going purely on the
    DIY route.</p>
<p>The most commonly quoted hypothesis to explain TENS
    effects is the so called gate control theory of pain,
    developed in the 1960s. This theory suggests that if
    small peripheral nerve fibres are engaged in
    transmitting pain-related signals to the central nervous
    system (brain and spinal cord), a simultaneous
    activation of nerve fibres which normally transmit
    simply sensory information from the periphery to the
    central nervous system can act to reduce the pain
    experience perceived (‘closing the pain gate’). It was
    also suggested that this ‘pain gate’ could be closed by
    distracting parallel activities to pain signals being
    transmitted from brain / spinal cord to the body. An
    example of such an effect would be an injury sustained
    during a sports event where the athlete only notices
    pain after the event.</p>
<p>The many studies carried out on TENS and related effects
    over the past 20 years lack consistency. For some of the
    observations in the laboratory about specific mechanisms
    at work (for example, <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-GABA">GABA</a>
    being involved in the signalling pathways, or the
    release of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">endogenous
        opioids</a>, or changes in the conduction properties
    of certain types of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">nerve
        fibres engaged in nociception, Aδ fibres</a>) it is
    not clear if they translate to any clinically
    significant effects.</p>
<p>Whether TENS is clinically effective or not is an
    unresolved question. A quote from a textbook on TENS
    nicely summarises: ‘… You can be certain of uncertainty
    when evaluating the clinical effectiveness of TENS. …’.
    It is less for a scarcity of studies than for the poor
    quality and poor design of many studies that there is no
    robust evidence. On the basis of existing literature it
    is not possible to come to valid conclusions about
    effectiveness, potential harm and adverse effects of
    TENS. TENS itself comes with a substantial placebo
    effect, so any valid evaluation beyond the placebo
    effect is not straightforward, especially if no major
    effects are to be expected anyway. Unsurprisingly, given
    the lack of robust evidence, there are no consistent
    clinical guidelines about TENS. Similar to what we said
    about <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/biofeedback">biofeedback</a>
    or <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/acupuncture">acupuncture</a>,
    if somebody finds that TENS helps them manage pain, why
    not use it as long as it does not cause harm (other than
    relatively minor effects on the wallet).</p>
