<p>Postoperative problems affecting the pelvis (part of the hip)
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Appearance. Although this can be minimal (if a tiny tube
        of bone has been taken) and is usually covered up, a
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">large bone graft or flap</a>        can leave a long, sometimes itchy scar. Stitches that
        run under the skin leave a less obvious scar than those
        that crisscross the incision and which are removed after
        10 days. This is enough time to create small stitch scars
        that are much less often seen on the face where stitches
        are removed after 5 or 6 days.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Pain</a> and discomfort.
        There are a variety of ways to minimise this but the
        hip takes your body weight, has numerous large muscles
        attached to it and if these have been interfered with,
        your hip will be sore for many days and stiff and uncomfortable
        for weeks.</li>
    <li>Limp. You are likely to walk with a limp for a variable amount
        of time depending on the amount of bone removed and muscles
        interfered with. You may need aids to walking for the
        first few days.</li>
    <li>Difficulty with bowel movement and passing urine. This is
        usually because of discomfort or constipation created
        by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">opioid painkillers</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>.
        Particularly with large bone grafts or flaps the sensory
        nerve to the upper thigh may be damaged and leave the
        area numb.</li>
</ul>
