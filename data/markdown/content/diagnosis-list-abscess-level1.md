<p>An abscess is a collection of fluid, sometimes quite thick, made
    up of infecting bacteria and the body’s cellular response
    to the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bacterial infection</a>.</p>
<p>The commonest source of the infection is a dead dental pulp (the
    nerve and blood supply inside a tooth) or a <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">“periodontal pocket”</a>    (a space between the cementum cells lining the outside of
    the tooth root and a layer of connective tissue called the
    periodontal ligament).</p>
<p>The abscess and its volume of fluid content (“pus”) are protected
    from the body’s immune system, the white blood cells, by
    a dense layer of tissue meaning that antibiotics may not
    be able to enter the abscess and kill off the hostile bacteria.
    This is symbolised in Figure 1.</p>

<p>This is why an operation (which may be very small or quite extensive,
    depending on the situation) is the usual treatment, also
    symbolised in Figure 1. This releases the pus and allows
    the protecting white blood cells (and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">appropriate antibiotics</a>)
    to gain direct contact with the bacteria.</p>
