<h1 id="idiopathic-/-atypical-facial-pain"> Idiopathic / atypical facial pain</h1>
<p><strong>Time-lines short term:</strong> This may be best
    thought of as gaining relief, possibly only to a degree
    of the most acute aspect of pain. This may be by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">injection
        or oral medication</a> and will act within minutes
    and last hours.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> This is a
    process of coming to terms with a condition which may
    not have a definitive cure and will probably require
    both long term medication or therapy and a completely
    different perspective on the situation. This takes
    several months.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> Now you come to
    terms with your condition accepting that while it may be
    lifelong there will be good times and bad times. A
    balance between a selfhelp approach and a professionally
    directed approach will allow you to continue to function
    and get the most from life. This may take years to fully
    adapt to.</p>
<h1 id="trigeminal-neuralgia">Trigeminal neuralgia</h1>
<p><strong>Time-lines short term:</strong> Relief within
    hours of trying the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiepileptics">antiepileptic
        medication carbamazepine</a> (which up to 80 % of
    people will gain) can be life changing and affirming.
    Minutes to hours.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> Realising that
    you may be on lifelong medication takes some adapting
    to, as does the realisation that breakthrough pain can
    occur unpredictably. This takes place over a period of
    months.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> This can range
    from fully adjusting to lifelong medication to coming to
    terms with the consequences of perhaps invasive
    neurosurgical treatment – for example trading being pain
    free with long term <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">loss of
        sensation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> This is a
    process of coming to terms with a condition which may
    not have a definitive cure and will probably require
    both long term medication or therapy and a completely
    different perspective on your situation. This takes
    several months and may be very frustrating. Do not be
    tempted to push for the removal of multiple healthy
    teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> Now you come to

<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> Removal of or

<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> Removal of or
    direct treatment of an inflamed pulp by direct dental
    means should be definitive.</p>

    and last hours.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> Overall
    treatment for this condition is very problematic and
    expectations will have to be realistic. Gaining this
    perspective is essential to maintaining a useful quality
    of life.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> Now you come to

    adapt to. Anything that helps and does no harm is worth
    considering. Beware the risks of dependence on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">long-term
        analgesia</a>, particularly those containing
    mood-altering constituents such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">opioids</a>

    postherpetic neuralgia evolves.</p>
<h1 id="postherpetic-neuralgia">Postherpetic neuralgia</h1>
<p><strong>Time-lines short term:</strong> This painful
    condition is best prevented as above. If not, the most
    acute pain responds to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">opioid
        analgesia</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines medium term:</strong> If persisting,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">neuropathic
        analgesia</a> will be helpful but may be required
    lifelong. A balanced and realistic expectation of pain
    management becomes essential.</p>
<p><strong>Time-lines long term:</strong> Long-term
    avoidance of exacerbating factors and lifestyle
    modification with lifelong neuropathic analgesia may be
    needed.</p>
