<p>Treatment and management of dysphagia is as varied as the
    wide range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia/detailed">underlying
        conditions</a> and the severity of the resulting
    dysphagia symptoms. Broadly speaking, dysphagia
    treatment modalities include surgical and non-surgical
    options. The latter can be divided into adaptive
    strategies (such as <a href="/help/oral-food">modified
        food textures</a>) and compensatory approaches (such
    as <a href="/help/salt">specialised swallowing
        manoeuvres</a>).</p>
<p>Because of the wide range of underlying conditions and
    the need to prevent serious consequences such as <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">malnutrition</a> or
    pneumonia from aspiration, a range of medical
    disciplines are involved in dysphagia management,
    including oral and maxillofacial surgery, ENT (ear, nose
    and throat) surgery, neurology and <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapy</a>.
    Careful initial assessment of the type and extent of
    swallowing dysfunctions is essential, as is long-term
    monitoring in order to identify and address problems
    early. These conditions can be associated with the
    prevention and/or treatment of <a href="/help/mental-health">mental health issues</a>,
    such as depression and social isolation, so the benefits
    may be far reaching.</p>
<p>Surgical interventions from a maxillofacial perspective
    include the removal of <a href="/diagnosis-list-salivary-gland-systems-level1">salivary
        glands</a> or relocation of salivary gland ducts for
    the management of sialorrhea (severe drooling), or the
    placement of a <a href="/help/non-oral-food">percutaneous endoscopic
        gastrostomy (PEG)</a> to enable enteral (tube)
    feeding to maintain nutrition in the presence of severe
    dysphagia. Acute and severe aspiration may require the
    placement of a <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">tracheostomy</a>
    in order to protect the airway.</p>
<p>The role of surgical interventions in the management of
    dysphagia in progressive neuromuscular conditions is not
    well defined and is controversial. Dysphagia as a common
    long-term and often severe adverse effect of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>
    applied to the head and neck region is often caused by
    strictures or stenoses (narrowing) of the upper
    oesophageal region and spasms of the cricopharyngeus
    muscle (a circular muscle in the neck that needs to
    relax to allow food passage), in addition to swallowing
    problems associated with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry
        mouth)</a> following radiotherapy. Endoscopic
    dilatation and laser ablation of pharyngeal
    constrictions lie within the field of ENT surgery, and
    middle and lower oesophageal causes within the field of
    gastroenterology.</p>
<p>Nonsurgical interventions include a significant
    contribution by reassurance, <a href="/help/mental-health">mental health support</a>
    and self-help strategies (see below). Medications play
    only a minor role in the management of dysphagia, with a
    few notable exceptions. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/botulinum">Botulinum
        toxin</a> injections into the submandibular
    (salivary) gland are a less invasive method to manage
    severe sialorrhea (<a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">submandibular
        saliva</a> being ‘at rest’ saliva which pools and is
    more mucinous). Medications used in the management of
    some neuromuscular degenerative conditions, such as
    Parkinson’s disease or myasthenia gravis (autoimmune
    condition leading to muscle weakness) can also mitigate
    related dysphagia problems, at least temporarily.</p>
<p><a href="/help/salt">Speech and language therapy</a>
    plays a major role in the compensatory approach to
    dysphagia management, by assessment and monitoring, and
    by swallowing rehabilitation and training. This includes
    a number of swallowing manoeuvres that, combined with <a href="/help/oral-food">suitable food textures</a>,
    can help enable safe swallowing and oral food intake,
    often despite significant impairments. Speech and
    language therapists typically are also a good source of
    practical information and pragmatic ways to work around
    difficulties. Adaptions may include individually
    optimised food textures and temperatures, special
    cutlery, and many other useful tips &amp; tricks,
    alongside developing new habits such as not to talk
    while eating.</p>
