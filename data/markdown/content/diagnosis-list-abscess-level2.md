<p>Oral micro-organisms can reach the periapical tissues (structures
    adjacent to the tip of root) via the root canal system or
    via the periodontal ligament (connective tissue fibres that
    attach a tooth to its position in the bone). If the bacteria
    are sufficiently virulent and/or the host defences compromised
    then the infection may give rise to a dentoalveolar abscess
    (a dental abscess; most commonly a periapical abscess or
    a periodontal abscess).</p>
<p>The face has a layer of superficial connective tissue, mainly
    collagen, beneath the skin, the facial fascia. The complex
    attachment of the facial fascia determines how these infections
    spread.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about the facial fascia and
        resulting infection-spread pathways, this information
        is in our section on <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>An abscess may remain localised and drain via a small intraoral
    sinus (a ‘gum boil’, see Figure 1) or may spread giving rise
    to a severe cellulitis involving multiple tissue spaces (a
    cervicofacial abscess, see Figure 2).</p>

        the lower jaw bone and the masseter muscle), one of the
        fascial spaces.</figcaption>

<p>A variety of organisms are involved in these <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>.
    Alpha-haemolytic streptococci, non-haemolytic streptococci,
    Gram-negative cocci, actinomyces species, actinobacillus
    actinomyetemcomitans and Gram-negative anaerobic rods are
    all observed. There is an increasing recognition of the role
    of anaerobic bacteria, especially streptococci in these infections.</p>
<p>The specific signs and symptoms will depend on which tissue spaces
    are involved. The symptoms may include: pain, swelling, discharge,
    tenderness to percussion of involved teeth, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus (difficulty opening the mouth)</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)</a>.
    Trismus or dysphagia, particularly for fluids (it may be
    even impossible to swallow one’s own saliva) are warning
    signs that the airway may be at risk. Systemic upset is variable,
    but may manifest as pyrexia, tachycardia and hypotension
    (fever, fast heart beat and low blood pressure). Infections
    of the anterior maxilla (the front of the upper jaw) may
    rarely give rise to cavernous sinus thrombosis, a condition
    which still has a mortality of 30% despite antibiotic therapy.
    The signs of a blood clot forming in the hollow spaces behind
    the eye sockets (a cavernous sinus thrombosis) include proptosis
    (bulging of the eye), chemosis (swelling of the inside of
    the eyelids), ophthalmoplegia (impaired eye movements) and
    marked systemic upset.</p>
