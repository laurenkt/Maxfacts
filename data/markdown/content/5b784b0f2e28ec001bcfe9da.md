<p>Antacid medications do not directly address any oral and maxillofacial
    conditions. However, some of these drugs may serve a useful
    purpose as adjunctive (supporting) medications to protect
    the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, in particular of
    the stomach.</p>
<p>Antacid medications can be broadly subdivided into three types
    according to their mode of action:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a variety of preparations that simply neutralise surplus
        stomach acid and/or provide a protective layer for the
        stomach lining;</li>
    <li>drugs that reduce the release of stomach acid by bonding
        to a particular receptor on the surface of stomach cells
        (H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists);</li>
    <li>drugs that irreversibly block an enzyme (the ‘gastric proton
        pump’) that is involved in the release of gastric acid
        (proton pump inhibitors, PPIs).</li>
</ul>
<p>A wide range of <strong>over-the-counter preparations</strong>    to deal with milder forms of indigestion simply undergo an
    acid – base, or a buffered reaction with excess gastric acid
    (Figure 1). Neutralising excess acid usually gives quick
    relief of symptoms. These remedies are available in the form
    of liquids, suspensions, water-soluble tablets, lozenges
    or chewable tablets.</p>

        reactions (top) and buffered reactions.</figcaption>

<p>Such preparations typically contain aluminium or magnesium hydroxide
    Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> or Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, magnesium or calcium
    carbonate MgCO<sub>3</sub> or CaCO<sub>3</sub>, sodium bicarbonate
    NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (also known as baking soda).</p>
<p>Some liquid preparations and suspensions contain further active
    ingredients such as alginates, which can create a temporary
    protective coat in the gastrointestinal tract. <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">Alginates are organic polymers</a>    that are made up of chains of various sugar molecules and
    are isolated from a variety of algae and seaweeds. These
    polymers act as a barrier for acid and non-acid stomach fluids
    (such as pancreatic enzyme fluid), protect the stomach lining
    and enable healing in this way. A synthetic version of a
    related chemical that also provides a protective layer for
    the stomach lining is sucralfate. Sucralfate is a complex
    of sucrose octasulfate with aluminium hydroxide. It dissociates
    in the acidic stomach environment, where it subsequently
    polymerises and forms a protective film on the stomach lining;
    sucralfate is used in the treatment of stomach ulcers. A
    pre-polymerised version of sucralfate is used in the treatment
    of <a href="/treatment/surgery/oral-mucosal-lesions/detailed">oral mucositis</a>.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong> receptor antagonists</strong>    reduce the production of gastric acid by competing with the
    histamine receptor in gastric cells by binding to this receptor
    and thus blocking it for histamine. Histamine, alongside
    food and insulin, triggers the release of gastric acid, hydrochloric
    acid (HCl), when binding to the H<sub>2</sub> receptor. By
    blocking this histamine action, the secretion of the volume
    of gastric acid as well as its acidity are reduced. This
    is a useful mechanism to allow time for healing of stomach
    ulcers. Commonly used H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists
    are ranitidine (Figure 2) and cimetidine.</p>

</figure>
<p>H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists are generally well tolerated
    medications, but like all medicinal drugs can have adverse
    effects. Reducing the amount of gastric acid in particular
    enhances the risk for infections of the gastrointestinal
    tract, especially diarrhoea. The absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>    through the stomach lining is impaired and may lead to vitamin
    B<sub>12</sub> deficiency (which needs to be replaced usually
    by intramuscular injection every three months).</p>
<p><strong>Proton pump inhibitors, PPIs</strong> provide a more
    profound and long-lasting suppression of the secretion of
    gastric acid (up to 99 %) by irreversibly blocking the enzyme
    that orchestrates the last stage of gastric acid secretion.
    This gastric proton pump enzyme, hydrogen/potassium adenosine
    triphosphate enzyme (H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase),
    is very effectively blocked by a particular type of chemical
    (Figure 3), of which many variations have been developed.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Generic structure of a proton
        pump inhibitor (left); right: three examples of commonly
        prescribed PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The adverse effects of PPIs are similar to those of H<sub>2</sub>    receptor antagonists (see above) but tend to be more pronounced
    and include a reduction in iron uptake and thus may cause
    iron deficiencies. It is generally not recommended to use
    PPIs as long-term medications. The major issue, aside from
    gastrointestinal hurry, is that 60 % of people taking PPIs
    for more than two years will require three-monthly vitamin
    B<sub>12</sub> injections.</p>
<p>There are two circumstances where maxillofacial surgery may make
    use of antacid medications, H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists
    or (more commonly) proton pump inhibitors. The first application
    is as a supportive medication to prevent damage to the stomach
    lining by a range of drugs taken orally. Medications that
    are used in maxillofacial surgery and that may cause such
    damage include</p>
<ul>
    <li>a wide range of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesic drugs</a>,
        in particular <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/aspirin">aspirin</a>        and all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);</li>
    <li>a number of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>,
        including erythromycin and tetracyclines;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroids</a>        , including prednisone and methylprednisolone, and oestrogen
        (for example, in oral contraceptives);</li>
    <li>other commonly prescribed medications, including statins
        (to lower cholesterol levels), <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/thyroid">thyroid hormone</a>        replacement drugs, and some medications used to lower
        blood pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another use of proton pump inhibitors, is during surgery under
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>,
    for people suffering from acid reflux. In order to prevent
    aspiration of gastric acid under these circumstances, a proton
    pump inhibitor may be given ahead of surgery. The most common
    indication is if general anaesthesia is needed in pregnancy
    or for people with a hiatus hernia.</p>
