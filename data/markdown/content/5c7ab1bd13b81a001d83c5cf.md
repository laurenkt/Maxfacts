<p>Arachidonic acid is a prototype fatty acid (Figure 1). It is
    a substance that is mainly taken up from food (meat and eggs)
    but is also synthesized by the bodyâ€™s metabolism in humans.
    From its basic structure, several sub-groups of fatty-acid
    derivates (lipids) are synthesized in many different cells
    in the body and are mainly found in the cell membranes. One
    such subgroup is called eicosanoids, all of which are signalling
    / messenger molecules in a wide variety of cell and body
    functions, and which have some hormone-like activities.</p>

<p>Prostaglandins and thromboxanes are all members of the group
    of eicosanoids. All of these derivatives of arachidonic acid
    maintain the 20 carbon atoms in the molecular backbone of
    arachidonic acid, prostaglandins in addition have a five-membered
    carbon ring in common in their molecular structure (Figure
    2).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Examples of molecular structures
        of prostaglandins and thromboxanes compared with arachidonic
        acid. Also shown is the structure of prostacyclin; this
        prostaglandin is used as a medicinal drug (it is a vasodilator
        and inhibits platelet activation).</figcaption>

<p>The metabolism of lipids is certainly not a core subject of oral
    and maxillofacial surgery, but some of the many different
    physiological roles of prostaglandins and thromboxanes touch
    on processes that are relevant in a maxillofacial context:
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">pain signalling and sensation</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">blood clotting</a>.
    A crude inspection of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins
    (and thromboxanes) from arachidonic acid actually helps to
    see these connections.</p>
<p>Prostaglandins are synthesised in the body from arachidonic acid
    by the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)</a>    . COX-1 is expressed at a constant level in most cells of
    the body and supports the ongoing synthesis of the various
    prostaglandins needed for general, normal cell functions.
    COX-2 is only expressed when <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">cytokines</a>    (signalling molecules that are released when there is tissue
    damage) are present. COX-2 catalyses the synthesis of those
    prostaglandins needed to deal with tissue damage. These prostaglandins
    cause painful inflammatory responses. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/immunosuppressants">Immunosuppressants</a>,
    such as glucocorticoids, reduce COX-2 expression. Also, inhibition
    of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins
    potentially has an analgesic effect (for example, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/aspirin">aspirin</a>    hinders the COX enzymes and thus the conversion of arachidonic
    acid to prostaglandins).</p>
<p>Most <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">nociceptors</a>    (specialised sensors for pain stimuli) in healthy tissue
    are mechanically insensitive, even to strong stimuli. Prostaglandins
    can cause these to become excitable by pressure, temperature
    changes and tissue acidosis (increased acidity of tissue
    and blood in response to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>).
    This can result in <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">hyperalgesia</a>    (excessive pain sensation) due to increased excitability
    of sensory neurons by a decreased threshold for activation.
    Some prostaglandins increase pain sensation by reducing the
    action of inhibitory neurotransmitters (for example, glycine).
    The overall increased pain sensation resulting from the action
    of prostaglandins is not due to direct interaction with,
    and activation of, the nociceptors. Instead, the overall
    prostaglandin effect on pain sensation is to increase the
    frequency of pain signals being sent in response to a stimulus.</p>
<p>Prostaglandins are also synthesized in the blood cells and in
    the cells forming the lining of blood vessels. The involvement
    of prostaglandins in the inflammatory response [treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2]
    in these locations is associated with further local effects.
    Prostaglandins inhibit the aggregation of platelets (and
    thus hinder the blood clotting process after injury) and
    act locally as highly effective <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/vasopressor">vasodilators</a>.
    Thromboxanes (also synthesized by platelets), are the counterplayers
    in this mechanism; they are powerful <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/vasopressor">vasoconstrictors</a>    and support <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">platelet aggregation</a>.
    A well-balanced equilibrium between prostaglandins and thromboxanes
    is one of the essential controls of a normal, healthy blood
    flow in healthy blood vessels.</p>
