    focusing on surgery and radiotherapy.</p>

<h1 id="issues-to-consider-in-the-choice-of-treatment-modality">Issues to consider in the choice of treatment modality</h1>
<h2>Patient factors</h2>
<p>The general health of a patient can have a major bearing on the
    choice of treatment modality to adopt. A large proportion
    of patients tend to smoke tobacco, drink alcohol and have
    significant related co-morbidities. Pre-existing medical
    problems such as heart and chest disease are common in patients
    with mouth cancer. In addition to fitness to survive <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>    and surgery, complications are more likely to arise following
    surgery in such circumstances.</p>
<p>However, radiotherapy should not be considered an ‘easy option’
    as an alternative. In medically compromised individuals it
    has substantial associated morbidity, including a mortality
    quoted in the literature for radical chemoradiation higher
    than that of surgery.</p>
<p>Patients should clearly be involved in the decision if they are
    competent to make decisions. Some patients rely on their
    carers, friends and family and it can be helpful to include
    them in the process. It has also been shown that patients
    with good family and social support tend to do better.</p>
<h2>Tumour factors</h2>
<p>In some instances, for example small tumours (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">stage 1 or 2</a>)
    both surgery and radiotherapy are equally effective in terms
    of loco-regional control and survival. Then, other issues
    such as functional outcome, quality of life and morbidity
    as well as patient preference will help to decide on the
    most appropriate treatment modality. It is always worth remembering
    that while the other modalities can be repeated, radical
    radiotherapy is a one-off technique.</p>
<p>The proximity of certain structures to a tumour will influence
    the treatment modality. For example, where there is bone
    involvement, surgery is preferred to radiotherapy (better
    control and less side effects). Tumours involving the carotid
    artery or base of skull can mean not being able to achieve
    a clear margin in surgical removal (termed ‘not resectable’).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that what may be a ‘non-resectable’ (or non-reconstructable)
    tumour in one surgeon’s mind is entirely treatable in another’s.
    This variation is universal, the use of multidisciplinary
    teams (UK), tumour boards (USA) and other forms of multidisciplinary
    experts working together aim to reduce this but the variation
    will never reduce to zero. In practice, a small proportion
    of tumour margins are positive. Adjuvant radiotherapy (given
    after surgery) is indicated in such cases to improve control
    but is never as good as achieving histologically clear surgical
    margins (variously defined as 2 - 5 mm tumour-free margin
    histologically).</p>
<p>The presence or high risk of neck disease (lymph nodes in the
    neck affected by malignancy) is usually addressed by surgery.
    Certain tumour features such as large tumours, thicker lesions,
    tongue site and histological features (such as poor differentiation
    or perineural (direct) spread) may sway the decision towards
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">neck dissection</a>.
    There have been attempts at predicting the likelihood of
    lymph nodal metastases accurately but to date it remains
    an inexact science (for example, <i>ca</i>. 30% of clinical
    and imaging T2N0 tongue cancers will have at least micro-metastases
    in the neck).</p>
<p>More advanced tumours are better controlled with surgery, followed
    by adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemoradiation (combination of
    chemo- and radiotherapy) may have a role to play in poorly
    differentiated tumours, those with extracapsular spread of
    tumour from lymph nodes, or positive margins after surgery
    – all signs of a ‘high risk’ squamous cell oral cancer.</p>
<h2>Clinician factors</h2>
<p>Local expertise, resources and better outcome associated with
    a preferred modality within each team are practical considerations
    which often influence the treatment choice and can render
    national guidelines ineffective, even when apparent international
    ‘gold standards’ of care exist.</p>
<h1 id="metastatic-disease-in-the-neck">Metastatic disease in the neck</h1>
<p>The lymphatic drainage of the oral cavity is generally an orderly
    and sequential flow into the submental, submandibular and
    upper jugular chain (spaces below the floor of the mouth).
    Malignant disease usually spreads in a similar orderly fashion.
    Exceptions are after previous treatment (either surgical
    or non-surgical, both change the pattern of lymphatic drainage)
    and the ‘skip metastases’ phenomenon (local lymph nodes are
    bypassed in this type of spread) for tongue lesions to the
    lower jugular chain (area of lymphatic drainage system in
    the lower neck). Figure 1 shows a sketch of lymph node locations
    in the neck.</p>

        in the neck.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The presence of metastatic disease in the neck worsens the prognosis
    by about 50%. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to
    predict the presence of disease in the neck accurately. We
    know that overall, about 30% of oral cancer is likely to
    have spread to the neck on presentation even though it is
    not palpable clinically.</p>
<p>The decision to treat the neck is dependent on several factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>presence of any enlarged lymph node(s) - presumed to be metastatic
        disease until proven otherwise</li>
    <li>there is a high risk of clinically undetected disease in
        the neck (occult metastases)</li>
    <li>poor compliance expected; if a patient is unlikely to keep
        follow-up appointments</li>
    <li>microvascular access for <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive free flap transfer</a>        is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to achieve regional control of the disease, lymph nodes
    in the neck can be treated surgically with a neck dissection
    or by radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the preferred option.
    Figure 2 and Figure 3 schematically illustrate two versions
    of surgical neck dissection; a selective version (Figure
    2) and a radical version (Figure 3).</p>

<h1 id="preferred-treatment-modalities-in-practice">Preferred treatment modalities in practice</h1>
<p>Small oral malignancies can be treated effectively (with similar
    cure rates) using either <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    or surgery. The aim is to keep to a single treatment modality,
    thereby reducing the side effects. In such instances, a better
    functional outcome (for example, tongue base better with
    radiotherapy) or fewer side effects (for example, surgery
    better when tumour is close to bone) will influence the decision.
    The patient’s preference after <i>full information</i> on
    the risks and benefits must also be taken into account.</p>
<p>Treatment of large tumours usually requires both modalities.
    The neck is treated surgically if the nodes are enlarged,
    involved, at high risk of being involved or where <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">microvascular access</a>    is required.</p>
