<p>Craniofacial surgery, sometimes known as cranio-maxillofacial
    surgery, is a sub-specialty in its own right of both maxillofacial
    surgery and neurosurgery. Today craniofacial teams are essentially
    concentrated on the paediatric craniofacial anomalies. The
    principal indications for paediatric craniofacial surgery,
    in the early months of life, are the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies/detailed">craniosynostoses</a>.</p>
<p>The overlapping fundamental expertise of paediatric anaesthetists,
    paediatric neurosurgeons and paediatric maxillofacial surgeons
    are combined in the treatment of these conditions.</p>
<p>On the basis that most <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies/detailed">craniofacial syndromes</a>    are caused by premature suture fusion, or failure to develop,
    or even absence of growth site, it is intuitive that suture
    release to permit conventional growth at a time that will
    be most likely to allow conventional growth is the basis
    of treatment.</p>
<p>As compression of the contents of the skull is potentially lethal
    and the ‘neurocranium’ (the part of the skull containing
    the brain and eyes) develops earliest, operations which effectively
    cut out the affected cranial sutures to allow the brain to
    expand in very young children are appropriate.</p>
<p>The ‘viscerocranium’ (the skeleton of the face and parts of the
    jaw bones) develops later, in the simplistic order of: orbits
    (eye sockets) before mandible (lower jaw) before maxilla
    (upper jaw) before nose. Timed interventions to maximise
    growth while minimising risk make sense. In some instances,
    craniofacial sutures are released early, with planned operations
    or other interventions (such as functional orthodontics)
    carried out at specific times to harness natural growth periods.</p>
<p>In some cases, where, for example, a complete replacement of
    functional tissue (such as the temporomandibular joint (jaw
    joint)) is needed, the surgery is carried out once growth
    is completed although temporising procedures or interventions
    may take place during growth.</p>
