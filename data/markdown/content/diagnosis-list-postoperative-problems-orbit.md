<p>Postoperative (and post injury) problems affecting the orbit
    (eye socket) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loss of vision. Clearly this is extremely rare but devastating.
        Conditions which raise the pressure inside the enclosed
        space of the eye socket which contains the globe of the
        eye, its nerve and blood vessels, and surrounding fat
        and connective tissue, can create a risk to sight. These
        include bleeding (particularly arterial bleeding) and
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a> but
        may even include air at higher than normal pressure.
        Orbital compartment syndrome (condition arising from
        increased pressure in the orbital space) is one of a
        small number of genuine maxillofacial emergencies.</li>
    <li>Disturbance of vision. The muscle attachments for the muscles
        that move the globe of the eye are attached at various
        points in the orbit. Eye movement is dependent on these
        muscles and the position of the globe of the eye sitting
        in a surrounding of peri-orbital fat, given support by
        fibrous strands of fascia (a form of connective tissue).
        Change in the position of the globe of the eye or disturbance
        of the function of the relevant muscles leads to double
        vision.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Disturbance in sensation</a>.
        The nerve supplying feeling to the area of cheek below
        the eye runs in the floor of the orbit. This is a typical
        area for fractures as it is so thin. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">Cheekbone (zygoma or malar) complex fractures</a>        often include an element of disruption of the orbital
        floor. Less often the medial wall and much less often
        the roof or lateral wall are affected. Altered sensation
        in this area is common after <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage/getting-started">injury of soft</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">hard tissue</a>        or <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>.</li>
    <li>Appearance. Bruising and black eyes are common after both
        injury and surgery. More specific is the ‘subconjunctival
        haemorrhage’ (bleeding underneath the conjunctiva (the
        membrane that covers the white of the eye and lines the
        inside of the eyelids)) which is a bright red complete
        colouring out of either the lateral conjunctiva (to the
        side; cheekbone fracture) or medial (to the middle; serious
        nasal fracture). Chemosis is swelling of the conjunctiva
        which can look dramatic but is harmless and settles quickly.
        Surgical scars are very cosmetic and rarely seen. Rarely
        if an eyelid is operated on when swollen, the lower lid
        can retract outwards (ectropion) or inwards (entropion).</li>
    <li>Pain and nausea. Occurs rarely and usually in the young.
        Pain, nausea and vomiting can occur in a condition called
        ‘white eye blow out’ which is a pure pressure induced
        fracture of the orbital floor. It is an indication for
        early surgery diagnosed by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">coronal CT scans</a>        or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound imaging</a>        of the orbit.</li>
