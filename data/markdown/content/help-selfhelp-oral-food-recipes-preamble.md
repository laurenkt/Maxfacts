<p>Having a Maxfacts cookbook and recipes for times when eating
    can be rather challenging may, at first glance, seem a little
    counterintuitive. In fact, it makes perfect sense because
    preparing your own food (or even better have somebody help
    you with it) gives you complete control to get your food
    exactly right for your needs and appetite, no matter how
    unconventional that may be at the time. Accordingly, some
    recipes may look unconventional but do give these a try,
    many such slightly unconventional ideas do work rather well.</p>
<p>The recipe collection reflects what many people can enjoy and
    many recipes are fairly high in calories, useful in these
    circumstances. The good news is that there are hardly any
    restrictions to flavours, and almost everything and anything
    can be prepared in liquid, smooth or soft textures over a
    range of temperatures. It is quite straightforward to adjust
    the textures of your food to what you feel is most comfortable
    to eat. Usually this does not involve a great deal of kitchen
    chores but thinking a little bit outside the box and being
    imaginative and adventurous greatly helps to keep you well
    fed &amp; watered.</p>
<p>Since eating and drinking problems vary so widely, it is quite
    impossible to have a recipe collection that will work for
    everybody all the time. Instead, the idea is to have a wide
    range of tried and tested ideas and recipes to give you inspiration
    and ideas, to pick and mix from the menu. For those with
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth problems</a>    it is strongly recommended to avoid sugar and in particular
    sweet foods and drinks as snacks in order to avoid dental
    decay.</p>
<p>Our recipes, together with a summary of practical tips and some
    brief explanations about gelling and thickening agents are
    collated in a printable <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes/printable-cookbook">Maxfacts cookbook</a>,
    organised in sections of different food textures and temperatures.
    As an alternative, all recipes can also be found in a
    <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes/browse">small database, searchable for food textures and temperatures
        as well as for recipes</a>.</p>
