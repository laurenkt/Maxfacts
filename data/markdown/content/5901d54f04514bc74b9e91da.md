<h1 id="benign-lumps-of-the-mouth-jaws-and-face">Benign lumps of the mouth, jaws and face</h1>
<h2>Brown tumour of hyperparathyroidism</h2>
<p>This is a giant cell lesion which can look extremely florid (reddish)
    and mandates early <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>    for diagnosis. It occurs secondarily to hyperparathyroidism
    (overactivity of the parathyroid gland), but this diagnosis
    is usually made only after biopsy of the lump (either incisional
    or excisional) when the findings of giant cells in a fibrous
    stroma (scarred connective tissue) mandate an assessment
    of bone biochemistry and measuring parathyroid hormone levels
    (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">PTH blood test</a>).</p>
<h2>Congenital (present at birth) epulis</h2>
<p>This is a sessile (immobile) or pedunculated (with an elongated
    stalk of tissue) nodule containing granular cells on histological
    examination. Present at birth, the lesion is usually excised
    only once the child is one year old unless it significantly
    interferes with normal function.</p>
<h2>Epulis</h2>
<p>This is any gingival (affecting the gums) lump that has nonspecific
    features.</p>
<h2>Fibroepithelial polyp</h2>
<p>This is a benign but excessive response to low-grade recurrent
    trauma. These lesions may be sessile or pedunculated and
    can range from very small lumps looking like a genuine polyp
    in the cheek to lesions which can cover the entire palate
    (‘leaf fibroma’, see Figure 1).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> An example of ‘leaf fibroma’.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Histology will show a very dense collagenous fibrous tissue lined
    by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (layers of
    skin tissue cells).</p>
<h2>Granuloma</h2>
<p>Granulomata are swellings that show a characteristic histological
    appearance and may be caused by orofacial granulomatosis
    (see Figure 2 for an example), sarcoidosis, or implanted
    foreign bodies.</p>
<p>Orofacial granulomatosis is a persistent enlargement of the soft
    tissues of mouth, lips and the surrounding areas of the face.
    The swellings are not painful, the condition is thought to
    be of infectious origin. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory
    condition of unknown cause, it includes collections of granulomata
    and can occur in all parts of the body.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Orofacial granulomatosis may manifest
        with ‘cobblestone’ mucosal lumps, lip swelling and midline
        fissuring.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Giant cell granuloma (giant cell epulis)</h2>
<p>This is a very vascular gingival swelling and is probably caused
    by chronic irritation (see Figure 3). Histological examination
    demonstrates multinucleate giant cells in a vascular stroma.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Granuloma can mimic malignant
        disease.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Gingival fibromatosis</h2>
<p>This condition can be hereditary or, more often, drug induced.
    Phenytoin (anti-epileptic), ciclosporin A (immunosuppressive
    agent) and calcium channel blockers (common type of blood-pressure
    lowering agents) are the main causes. Figure 4 depicts an
    example.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Drug-induced gingival fibromatosis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Haemangioma</h2>
<p>Haemangiomata are developmental lesions of blood vessels. They
    are usually congenital (present at birth) and tend to grow
    with the child. Most of these lesions (up to 80%) regress
    spontaneously. Haemangioma can be identified by blanching
    under pressure (classically by using a glass slide; see Figure
    5). Haemangiomata are quite different from other vascular
    malformations (see below).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Haemangioma of the buccal mucosa.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Hyperplasia</h2>
<p>Particularly notable is irritation hyperplasia, which is a hyperplastic
    response to repeated trauma following denture-induced
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">ulceration</a>. Rolls of hyperplastic tissue which may be
        quite erythematous (red) and resemble malignant disease
        are seen particularly in the buccal sulci (see Figure
        6). This condition is more common in the lower jaw than
        the upper. Histology is similar to the fibroepithelial
        polyp (see above).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Irritation hyperplasia caused
        by an ill-fitting full lower denture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Lipoma</h2>
<p>Lipomata are benign tumours of fat cells found anywhere in the
    body including the mouth (see Figure 7).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Intraoral lipoma.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Papilloma</h2>
<p>Squamous cell papillomata are multiple papillated pink and white
    asymptomatic lumps; they look like and are very similar to
    warts in skin. These lesions should be readily identifiable
    as such (see Figure 8).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Squamous papilloma of the tongue
        tip.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main aetiological factor is the human papilloma virus (HPV),
    and there is an increase in people with sexually transmitted
    diseases. Most oral papillomata are of no real significance
    and are not related to oral infection with HPV-16 or HPV-18,
    which is a transient infection affecting up to 10% of the
    population (more common in males than females) and is cleared
    within a year. This virus type is, however, clearly associated
    with HPV driven <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma</a>    which has a much better prognosis in non-smokers. The relationship
    between virus type, transient infection and virally driven
    cancer in specific anatomical sites in the head and neck
    remains unclear but prevention of infection by vaccination,
    changing safe sex practices or some as yet unknown intervention
    to remove an identified cause of head and neck cancer is
    a vital area of further research.</p>
<h2>Pyogenic granuloma</h2>
<p>Pyogenic granuloma is an inflammatory response to chronic irritation.
    Lesions are found in a variety of intraoral sites dependant
    on aetiology. Puberty and pregnancy ‘epulides’ are hormonally
    sensitive examples. Figure 9 depicts an example.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Large pyogenic granuloma of the
        tongue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Vascular malformations</h2>
<p>These are divided into arterio-venous <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistulae</a>    (abnormal connection between a vein and an artery), high
    flow venous malformations, and low flow venous malformations.</p>
<h1 id="benign-lumps-of-the-neck">Benign lumps of the neck</h1>
<p>Traditionally and for practical reasons, these lesions can be
    divided into those commonly presenting in children and those
    commonly presenting in adults. There are fundamental differences
    in the underlying pathology of neck lumps in the two groups.</p>
<h2>Neck masses in children</h2>
<p>Head and neck neoplasia is a very rare cause of neck swellings
    in children. In children, neck swellings are usually either
    congenital or inflammatory. These neck masses also include
    a variety of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a> and
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistulae</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cervical lymphadenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck)</strong>    - it is important to realise that children get cervical lymphadenopathy
    very easily indeed, and persisting cervical lymphadenopathy
    in children, unlike in adults, is more frequently due to
    transient reactive lymphadenopathy than anything else.</p>
<p>There are, however, specific infective and inflammatory conditions
    which will cause lymphadenitis. These include cat scratch
    fever which causes a generalised lymphadenopathy, but particularly
    cervical lymphadenopathy. Many other bacterial infections
    including dental infections cause cervical lymphadenitis.
    Of importance is mycobacterial lymphadenitis, usually caused
    by atypical mycobacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Sternomastoid tumour</strong> - this is probably a combination
    of spasm and small haematoma within the fibres of the sternomastoid
    muscle (pair of muscles, close to the surface, running along
    both sides of the neck) that creates the physical appearance
    of a mass. This can result in torticollis (wry neck) which
    can itself result in asymmetrical development of the head
    and face (postural plagiocephaly; flat head).</p>
<h2>Neck masses in adults</h2>
<p>Unlike in children, the finding of soft tissue mass in the neck
    of an adult is more often indicative of serious pathology.
    These neck masses can be divided into congenital, acquired,
    infective and tumours. Lumps present for a long time are
    likely to be less of a cause for concern. Rapidly increasing
    painful lumps are more likely due to infection. Hard painless
    lumps need urgent investigation by a specialist. These neck
    masses also include a variety of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistulae</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Benign tumours of the neck</strong> - benign tumours
    of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland origin</a>    are most common. Schwannoma (usually benign tumour of the
    tissue covering nerves), neurofibroma (another type of benign
    nerve sheath tumour) and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour">malignant tumours</a>    such as neurosarcoma account for approximately 25% of primary
    neck tumours, and the paragangliomas (tumours that originate
    in nerve tissue or near certain nerves and structures of
    blood vessels; see below) account for approximately 15%.
    Miscellaneous lumps such as lipoma (see Figure 10) and rhabdomyoma
    (benign tumour of skeletal muscles) are comparatively rare
    in the neck.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> A rare lipoma of the neck.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Neurogenic tumours</strong> - these can arise from any
    of the major nerves of the neck and are either schwannomas
    (neurolemmoma) or neurofibromas; the commonest nerve of origin
    is the vagus nerve (one of the cranial nerves, also known
    as the pneumogastric nerve; part of the control of heart,
    lungs and digestive tract).</p>
<p>Neurofibromas may be part of von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis
    or they may be solitary. If part of von Recklinghausen’s
    syndrome, they will be associated with multiple neurofibromas
    and café au lait spots over the skin. There may be association
    between neurofibromatosis and multiple neuroendocrine syndromes.
    Isolated neurofibromas can be excised although generally
    speaking the nerve will be irrevocably damaged by the excision
    and will require primary nerve repair.</p>
<p>Schwannomas on the other hand tend to stretch the surrounding
    nerve sheath and can often be excised while maintaining the
    integrity of the nerve of origin (see Figure 11 for an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed/figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> A CT scan of a C5 (fifth cranial
        nerve) schwannoma.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Paragangliomas</strong> - glomus vagale tumours are vagal
    paragangliomas arising from the mass of paraganglionic tissue
    within the perineurium of the vagus nerve just below the
    skull base. These may extend through the jugular foramen
    (aperture in the base of the skull). This is a slow growing
    mass in the upper neck, and symptoms are relatively late
    (pulsatile tinnitus, vertigo, deafness and pharyngeal pain).
    These tumours need to be investigated by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a> scanning and
    should be excised because they are at the risk of spreading
    into the cranial cavity. These are extremely vascular tumours
    and as most of them are crossed by the internal carotid artery,
    there is a high level of risk of vascular injury.</p>
<p><strong>Carotid body tumours</strong> - the carotid body tumour
    (glomus tumour) is the most common paraganglioma in the head
    and neck. These are uncommon tumours representing 0.6% of
    head and neck neoplasms and approximately 0.03% of all neoplasms.
    These tumours arise from the chemoreceptor bodies at the
    bifurcation of the carotid artery. Carotid body tumours can
    be distinguished on MRI or CT imaging from glomus vagule
    and glomus jugulare tumours (see below) because they tend
    to splay the internal and external carotid arteries, whereas
    the other two tend to displace the internal carotid artery
    anteriorly. There may be a clinical history of a slowly enlarging
    painless lump in the middle of the neck, this may be pulsatile.
    The lump will feel firm and rubbery, and it is classically
    described as being mobile from side to side, but not up and
    down (although this is not a particularly useful clinical
    sign in reality). The higher prevalence of carotid body tumours
    has been related to chronic hypoxemia from COPD (chronic
    obstructive pulmonary disease) and high altitudes. The sporadic
    form of carotid body paraganglioma is more common than the
    inherited variety and tends to occur more often in women.
    Familial tumours account for about 10% of all carotid body
    tumours and have an autosomal dominant mode with variable
    penetrance and higher incidence of bilateral tumours (which
    needs to be excluded with <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound scanning</a>).</p>
<p>Carotid body tumours are extremely vascular tumours and hence
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsies</a> should not
    be attempted. These tumours are characteristic on CT and
    MRI scans or by MRA (magnetic resonance angiography). These
    techniques may demonstrate widening (classic contrast and
    angiographic finding) of the carotid bifurcation (Lyre Sign).
    The majority of these tumours are benign although it is impossible
    to distinguish benign and malignant carotid body tumours
    on the basis of histology alone. Occasionally the tumour
    may transmit the carotid pulse or demonstrate a bruit or
    thrill. Because of its proximity to the carotid vessels and
    the X-XII cranial nerves, enlargement of the tumour may cause
    progressive neurological symptoms such as dysphagia (difficulty
    swallowing), odynophagia (distorted sense of smell) or hoarseness.
    There may be a history of symptoms suggestive of excessive
    catecholamine production (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood test</a>    for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels; VMA is a metabolite
    of catecholamine) such as fluctuating hypertension, flushing
    and palpitations, but this is actually very rare.</p>
<p><strong>Glomus jugulare / glomus tympanum</strong> - these paragangliomas
    arise around the jugular ganglion (part of the vagus nerve
    near the base of the skull) and tend to present with deafness
    and cranial nerve palsies. They rarely present as neck lumps.</p>
<p><strong>Infective neck masses</strong> - these tend to be either
    manifestations of cervical lymphadenopathy (enlargement of
    lymph nodes) or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess/more-info">abscesses</a>    of the cervical fascial spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Laryngocele -</strong> laryngoceles (abnormal air sac)
    arise within the circle of the laryngeal ventricle. They
    are commoner in males than in females and usually occur in
    people in their 60s. Most are unilateral, and 1% will contain
    malignant disease. Clinical findings include neck lump, hoarseness,
    sore throat, sometimes stridor (high-pitched breathing sound)
    and in 10% of cases there will be infection of the laryngocele.</p>
<p><strong>Pharyngeal pouch</strong> - this is a diverticulum (Zenker’s
    diverticulum; a pouch) of the pharyngeal mucosa, usually
    of the median posterior wall passing through Killian’s dehiscence
    (a small area of the wall of the pharynx). Commoner in males
    than females and usually a condition found in people more
    than 70 years old. Mostly causing difficulty in swallowing,
    although halitosis (bad breath) and regurgitation of undigested
    food can also occur. There may be cough, recurrent chest
    infection, hoarseness or a neck mass. This requires a ‘barium
    swallow’ (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray investigation</a>    of the swallowing process) and pharyngeal oesophagoscopy.</p>
