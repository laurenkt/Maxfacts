<p>With many different possible causes of trismus, and widely varying
    degrees of severity and duration in mind, we look in a little
    more detail and a little more systematically at the overall
    picture of this condition.</p>
<p>Causes for trismus can roughly be divided into those internal
    to the jaw joint (the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">temporomandibular joint, TMJ</a>),
    and those external to the joint.</p>
<h1 id="intra-articular-internal-to-the-jaw-joint-causes-for-trismus">Intra-articular (internal to the jaw joint) causes for trismus</h1>
<p>The jaw joint itself can be affected by inflammation from autoimmune
    conditions such as (rheumatoid) arthritis. Ankylosis, the
    fusing of bones in the joint, can be another consequence
    of inflammation in the joint. The connective tissue of the
    articular disk (the meniscus) of the temporomandibular joint
    normally provides the gliding surface for smooth movement
    of the jaw. This surface tissue can either be degraded by
    degenerative conditions such as arthritis or ankylosis, or
    may suffer some displacement from trauma. The latter is the
    most common intra-articular cause for trismus. All of these
    conditions lead to variable degrees of trismus and require
    exact diagnosis and assessment for treatment planning.</p>
<h1 id="extra-articular-external-to-the-jaw-joint-causes-for-trismus">Extra-articular (external to the jaw joint) causes for trismus</h1>
<p>Of the many different extra-articular causes of trismus, some
    are very common and mainly cause short-term temporary difficulties
    with opening of the mouth and/or movements of the jaw in
    general.</p>
<h2>Infection</h2>
<p>These can be odontogenic (dental) pulpal (soft centre of a tooth),
    periodontal (gum) or pericoronal (soft tissue surrounding
    erupting teeth) infections. Non-odontogenic infections include
    tonsillitis and tonsillar abscess, meningitis, mumps, tetanus
    (nowadays very rare, at least in the rich western countries)
    and a range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscesses</a>    afflicting the parotid gland or the base of the skull, as
    well as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">infections of the jaw bones</a>    (for example, acute osteomyelitis).</p>
<h2>Trauma</h2>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">Fractures</a> of the mandible
    (lower jaw) and the zygomatic arch (cheek bone) are common
    causes of trismus. Rare traumatic conditions causing scarring
    of the oral mucosa (lining of the mouth) may cause trismus.</p>
<h2>Dental and surgical treatment</h2>
<p>The two most common causes of trismus related to dental treatments
    are the extraction of teeth (in particular the extraction
    of mandibular third molars (wisdom teeth)) and local anaesthetic
    injections (which may sometimes cause a minor bleed and give
    rise to a haematoma).</p>
<h2><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">Temporomandibular (jaw) joint disorders</a></h2>
<p>These are common conditions that may be caused by trauma to the
    jaw joint (for example, prolonged and particularly wide opening
    of the mouth) or by painful spasms of the muscles that move
    the jaws (myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome).</p>
<h2>Tumours</h2>
<p>In particular tumours affecting the pharynx (back of the throat),
    the parotid gland (salivary gland), the jaws or jaw joints
    can all cause trismus. A pre-malignant condition common in
    the Indian subcontinent and related to chewing of betel nuts
    is submucous fibrosis, an extreme form of scarring of the
    submucosal tissue in the mouth leading to difficulties with
    tongue and jaw movements. Any tumour which invades the muscles
    of mastication (muscles that enable chewing) can cause trismus;
    this includes the hard to identify tumours of the infratemporal
    fossa (cavity near the cheekbone).</p>
<h2><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</a></h2>
<p>Radiotherapy plays a role in the treatment of many head and neck
    malignancies. It can cause <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrosis</a>    of the jaw bones, osteoradionecrosis, and soft tissues in
    the head and neck region, depending on radiation dose. Trismus
    can occur as another (late on-set) side effect when the body’s
    attempts to heal radiation damage in the jaw muscles leads
    to extensive fibrosis (scarring) of the muscle tissue such
    that it becomes impossible to move the jaw and to open the
    mouth.</p>
<h2>Drugs</h2>
<p>A number of antipsychotic drugs (including fairly commonly prescribed
    tricyclic antidepressants (fluoxetine) and phenothiazines),
    some muscle-relaxing agents used in <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>    (succinyl choline, halothane) and metoclopramide (medication
    used to treat nausea and other stomach problems, including
    heartburn), amongst others, can cause trismus in different
    ways. Many <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    drugs cause stomatitis and mucositis (painful inflammation
    of the soft tissues in the mouth), often severe enough to
    lead to trismus.</p>
<h2>Congenital (inborn)</h2>
<p>If somebody is born with Möbius syndrome, a hypertrophy of the
    coronoid (a part of the mandible), they have an enlarged
    part of the mandible that will hinder movement of the jaws,
    at birth or later in life. Some rare hereditary conditions
    can also lead to malformations and malfunctions, for example
    short tendons of facial (and other) muscles and cause trismus
    (trismus pseudocamptodactyly syndrome).</p>
<h2>Other causes</h2>
<p>Scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that leads to hardening
    of the skin can cause trismus if facial skin is affected.
    Lupus erythematosus, another autoimmune disease, can cause
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">mouth ulcers</a>    as well as trismus from painful jaw joints. There can by
    psychogenic causes for trismus (an old-fashioned term for
    the effect is hysteria): extreme psychological and emotional
    distress can sometimes be translated to physical symptoms,
    with trismus being one these.</p>
