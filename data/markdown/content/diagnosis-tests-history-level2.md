<h1 id="some-background-to-the-philosophy-of-obtaining-a-medical-history">Some background to the philosophy of obtaining a medical history</h1>
<p>A well-known general dictionary defines medical history as ‘the
    past background of a person in terms of health’; whereas
    a well-known medical dictionary gives the definition as ‘information
    obtained from the patient to aid in establishing a medical
    diagnosis and developing a treatment plan’. While there is
    nothing technically wrong with the latter definition, we
    stick with the first one because its neutrality indirectly
    carries two important messages about medical histories:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the process requires active and open-minded engagement from
        <i>both</i> parties, patient and clinician – it cannot
        work if the process lacks mutual trust or is in any way
        prejudiced. One-sided searching of databases for symptoms
        and solutions is every bit as unhelpful as a clinician
        hearing or seeing only those signs and symptoms that
        fit a presumptive diagnosis.</li>
    <li>the process requires the willingness to engage with a degree
        of open-endedness by both parties, patient and clinician
        – it cannot work if there are preconceived ideas.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, the better and clearer the communication between clinician
    and patient over this process, the better will be the quality
    of the diagnosis and the mutual understanding of its implications
    as well as the eventual (informed) decisions about treatment
    options – where that is relevant. Exploration of the medical
    history is the biggest single step in arriving at a diagnosis;
    in combination with a careful <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">medical examination</a>    in many cases it is the only necessary step.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to believe that working the way through a medical
    history and trying to arrive at a diagnosis is a completely
    pre-determined, formulaic process. In reality, the process
    necessarily involves elements of uncertainties, intuition,
    recognition, consideration of probabilities and constant
    reiterations, often in several steps and supported by
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">medical examination</a> and a more or less extensive <a href="/diagnosis/tests">range of tests and investigations</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, a comprehensive medical history needs to appreciate,
    amongst other aspects, the social, cultural and economic
    circumstances of a person since all of these affect a person’s
    health and well-being (and, for example, may have impact
    on suitable care plans).</p>
<p>Below we describe the procedures and processes to obtain a medical
    history in non-emergency situations. In an emergency, there
    are neither time nor opportunity for these approaches to
    evaluation and instead <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">internationally agreed protocols for dealing with emergencies</a>    are followed to assess the situation and inform the most
    appropriate actions.</p>
<h1 id="the-process-of-obtaining-a-medical-history-aiming-to-diagnose-a-condition">The process of obtaining a medical history aiming to diagnose
    a condition</h1>
<p>Following our slightly more philosophical considerations above,
    we are ready to look at the process itself. Your symptoms
    (your main complaints / problems, as reported by you) will
    most likely be the reason for your appointment at the clinic.
    The <i>symptoms</i> will be the primary focus of the dialogue
    with the clinician who assembles the medical history (clinical
    <i>signs</i> of a / the condition are addressed in any following
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">medical examination</a>).
    A review of present and past (possibly including childhood
    diseases) illnesses and any long-term conditions will be
    included, as well as family conditions, and any previous
    surgery (reason and outcome). The medical history will include
    information about regular and acute medications (prescribed
    and over-the-counter drugs), known allergies (to medications,
    latex, food, antiseptics) and use of <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/overview">recreational drugs</a>,
    including <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">tobacco</a> use.</p>
<p>A review of body systems forms a systematic and structured part
    of the overall enquiry. It is used to assess symptoms and
    any potential functional limitations that are not covered
    by the investigation of the main symptom(s). It can reveal
    any additional undisclosed conditions which may require further
    investigation: the key for the clinician is to find a systematic
    approach to enquiry which will not miss major symptoms of
    disease. For people with complicated medical histories, or
    those likely to require major surgery, more intensive history
    taking is necessary. Table 1 summarises the structure and
    topics of a review of systems in a maxillofacial clinic.</p>

<p>If at this stage a definite diagnosis cannot be made, at least
    a provisional diagnosis may be made and/or some other possibilities
    may still have to be explored (differential diagnoses) next.

<h1 id="medical-history-in-preparation-for-elective-planned-surgery">Medical history in preparation for elective (planned) surgery</h1>
<p>Clerking is the term used to describe the structured pre-operative
    assessment by means of history taking, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">medical examination</a>,
    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests">relevant special investigations</a>.
    It applies to all patients admitted for any procedures.</p>
<p>At this stage, obviously a diagnosis will have been made and
    the role of medical history investigations is now to focus
    on fitness for surgery in general, and for <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>    in particular. The process follows similar patterns of assessments
    and investigations as before, usually with a particular emphasis
    on assessment of cardiovascular and respiratory systems (see
    Table 1, above) and aims to identify any relevant aspects
    that need to be addressed ahead of / for the planned surgery.</p>
<p>Pre-operative assessment clinics, where patients are clerked
    several days in advance of their operations, allow adequate
    time to order investigations, review the results, to anticipate
    and address medical and social problems. Pre-operative assessment
    clinics are in widespread use as part of the process of maximising
    ‘efficient’ use of expensive hospital resources, although
    how efficient the process actually is warrants careful scrutiny.</p>
