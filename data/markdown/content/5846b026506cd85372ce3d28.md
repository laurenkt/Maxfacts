<p>Postoperative problems affecting the teeth include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loss of vitality. Any damage to the blood supply of teeth
        following surgery can lead to pulp (nerve and blood tissue
        inside the tooth) death. This usually becomes <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infected</a>        as the resultant mush is a perfect growth medium for
        bacteria.</li>
    <li>Discolouration. Subsequent to leaked blood products from
        a dead pulp.</li>
    <li>Movement. Inflammation of, or damage to the supportive periodontal
        ligament can result in unwanted tooth movement.</li>
    <li>Direct damage. Chipping or fracturing of a tooth can result
        in minor (enamel only) damage, through dentinal exposure
        (painful) or pulp exposure (very painful).</li>
    <li>Abnormal occlusion. If the tooth extrudes it will meet its
        counterpart in the opposite jaw early keeping the bite
        open. Equally, if a jaw is repositioned incorrectly after
        a <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">fracture repair</a>        the teeth can meet unevenly. In operations where the
        jaw is reset (<a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic surgery</a>)
        the plan is for a different bite which will be subsequently
        orthodontically corrected.</li>
</ul>
