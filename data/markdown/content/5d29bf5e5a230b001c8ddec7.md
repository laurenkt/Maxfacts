<p><strong>Atraumatic tooth extraction</strong> techniques aim to
    minimise trauma to the bone structure and surrounding tissue
    and to preserve the socket. Conventional extraction of a
    tooth with forceps causes damage to the socket walls by an
    increasingly loosening motion imposed on the tooth from its
    surrounding, until it becomes loose enough for the tooth
    to be pulled out, and the ligament that attached the tooth
    to its socket snaps. Atraumatic tooth extractions instead
    avoid such enforced sideway motions by employing elevators
    and by eventually cutting the ligament.</p>
<p><strong>Intraradicular radiculectomy</strong> is a technique
    that reduces the socket dead space following multiple extractions,
    usually in the upper and lower labial segments. Following
    extraction, the bony septa between the sockets are removed
    by means of rongeurs (Figure 1 and Figure 2).</p>

<p>The buccal plate is then compressed manually and in-fractured
    to reduce the socket space. The approximation of buccal and
    lingual / palatal plates of the socket allows the gingival
    (gum) margins to be sutured to maintain the compression.
    This technique is of particular benefit for the insertion
    of immediate dentures.</p>
<h1 id="surgery-for-conventional-prosthodontics">Surgery for conventional prosthodontics</h1>
<p>Surgery for conventional prosthodontics addresses needs for fixed
    and removable prosthesis.</p>
<p>Non-implant <strong>fixed prostheses</strong> are predominately
    confined to crown and bridgework. Surgery for these prostheses
    is invariably confined to <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/surgical-endodontics">periapical surgery</a>    or <a href="/treatment-rest-detistry-periodontal-level3">periodontal procedures</a>.</p>
<p>Surgery for <strong>removable prostheses</strong> can be considered
    under soft tissue and hard tissue surgery. In either case,
    surgery is aimed at improving retention and stability of
    the prosthesis, improving comfort, or the removal of pathological
    tissue. It should be considered best practice for this kind
    of work to be carried out in close collaboration between
    the surgeon and the prosthetist.</p>
<h1 id="soft-tissue-surgery">Soft tissue surgery</h1>
<p>Common soft tissue procedures relevant in the context of pre-prosthetic
    surgery include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>frenectomy (removal of a small fold of soft tissue to relieve
        tightness);</li>
    <li>ridge reduction (removal of excess soft ridge tissue resulting
        from advanced <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal disease</a>);</li>
    <li>removal of irritation (‘denture’) hyperplasia (enlarged tissue);</li>
    <li>vestibuloplasty (improving the ridge height or sulcus depth).</li>
</ul>
