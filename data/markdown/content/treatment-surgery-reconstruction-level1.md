<p>It is useful to take a systematic look at the theme of maxillofacial
    surgical reconstruction for an impression of the philosophy,
    the working and the limitations of this technically highly
    developed approach to restore form and function. Maxillofacial
    reconstructive surgery relies heavily on the exploitation
    of human anatomy and nature’s ingenious ways of incorporating
    resilience into living systems.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to know more about the anatomy of the head
        and neck region, this information is in our section about
        <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>There are two aspects of classification: a systematic view of
    defects, and a systematic view of reconstructive techniques.</p>
<h2>Classification of defects</h2>
<p>In addition to the size, location and anatomical complexity,
    defects can be divided into types of tissue that needs to
    be reconstructed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>soft tissue</li>
    <li>bone</li>
    <li>composite</li>
    <li>special tissue (for example, nerve).</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, bone defects usually have some soft tissue component
    involved as well. It is often easier to think of the dominant
    tissue that is missing in the defect.</p>
<h2>Reconstructive techniques</h2>
<p>Many different reconstructive techniques are available:</p>
<ul>
    <li>open wound healing</li>
    <li>primary closure</li>
    <li>grafts</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">local flaps</a></li>
    <li>distant pedicled flaps</li>
    <li>distant free transfers</li>
    <li>prefabricated flaps</li>
    <li>prosthesis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open wound healing</strong> can be the best option in
    certain circumstances, leaving a superficial open wound to
    heal. This includes <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">laser</a>    wounds (see Figure 1), as well as some defects in young children.</p>
<p>There is clearly a limit to this option because deep or extensive
    wounds usually heal slowly with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">scarring</a>    and resulting deformity.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The result after granulation following
        laser excision of a small <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">squamous cell carcinoma</a>        of the lateral (side) tongue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Healing by <strong>primary closure</strong> is the most common
    reconstructive method used when the defect is small and the
    surrounding tissue is slack enough to allow advancement for
    closure of the wound. It provides the best outcome because
    the adjacent area provides similar quality tissue without
    the need for a separate donor site wound. The wound should
    also heal faster and, apart from suture removal, requires
    relatively simple aftercare.</p>
<p>Healing by primary closure is not a viable option when there
    is inadequate adjacent tissue because closure under tension
    will simply break down.</p>
<p>A <strong>graft</strong> is the transfer of tissue by complete
    separation from the donor site to the recipient site. This
    potentially dead piece of tissue then gains a new blood supply
    by ingrowth of new vessels from the recipient bed. This process
    works on the principle that the tissue’s nutritional needs
    are initially met by fibrin attachment with oxygen diffusion
    from the plasma of the tissue bed (coined ‘plasmatic imbibition’).
    Capillary ingrowth with establishment of new vascular supply
    follows shortly.</p>
<p>A graft can be from the same individual (autograft), from another
    individual of the same species (allograft) or from a different
    species (xenograft). Autografts are better for several reasons,
    including compatibility with the person’s immune system,
    lower rates of infection and ultimately better outcomes.</p>
<p>A graft can consist of</p>
<ul>
    <li>skin</li>
    <li>mucosa (lining tissue)</li>
    <li>fascia (strong bands of connective tissue)</li>
    <li>bone</li>
    <li>cartilage</li>
    <li>nerve.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>flap</strong> is transferred tissue that has its own
    blood supply. Reconstruction using grafts (see above) is
    limited by the need for a well-vascularised recipient site
    for a graft to ‘take’. A flap is much less dependent on the
    recipient site for ‘take’ because it brings its own, new,
    blood supply. The use of flaps with their own blood supply
    allows more tissue bulk and predictable healing and viability.
    The greater tissue bulk in flaps can provide better form,
    structure and character in comparison with grafts. The better
    the blood supply, the larger and more complex the amount
    of tissue will be transferable.</p>
<p>A flap can be</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">local</a>        (using adjacent tissue);</li>
    <li>distant or local pedicled (using remote or local tissue,
        two-stage procedure, temporarily maintaining a narrow
        base of tissue with the donor site for continued blood
        supply before complete detachment from the donor site
        after an initial period);</li>
    <li>distant free transfer (harvesting and detachment of tissue
        with its blood (and sometimes nerve) supply and transfer
        to the defect site; blood (and nerve) supply for transplanted
        tissue at recipient site re-established by re-anastomosis
        (reconnecting) of transferred blood vessels to suitable
        vessels (and nerves) using microvascular techniques;
        see Figure 2).</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Left: an example of arterial and
        venous micro-anastomosis; right: controversy exists on
        whether more (as shown here) or fewer venous anastomoses
        are advantageous.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two main patterns of blood supply for flaps – random
    or axial. A random pattern relies on general subcutaneous
    blood flow.  An axial flap supply is based on a specific
    vascular pedicle. Some flaps feature a combination of the
    two types of blood supply.</p>
<p>Free flaps can consist of soft or hard (bone) tissue, or a combination
    of both. Free flaps can be harvested from many different
    distant body locations.</p>
