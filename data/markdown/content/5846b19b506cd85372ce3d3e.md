<p>Postoperative problems affecting the foot include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since the demise of the use of the dorsalis pedis (using
        the artery on the back of the foot) osseocutaneous free
        flap for use in <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">maxillofacial reconstruction</a>        because of concerns around severe donor site morbidity
        and impact on patients living with and beyond cancers
        quality of life, there are no other relevant issues affecting
        the foot with respect to maxillofacial surgery. The only
        exception are problems stemming from the use of the
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/lower-leg">lower leg</a> as a flap and graft donor site.</li>
    <li>These effects are usually:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">altered sensation</a>                over the lateral foot (side of the foot) from
                use of the sural nerve (sensory nerve in the
                calf of the leg) as a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive nerve graft</a>,
                or if injured during lower leg skin in flaps
                or grafts;</li>
            <li>inability to elevate the big toe, secondary to dysfunction
                of muscles dissected when raising a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">free fibula microvascular flap</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
