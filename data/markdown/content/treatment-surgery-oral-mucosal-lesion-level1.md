<p>As is evident from the long list of conditions and causes
    discussed in the section on <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">diagnosis
        of ‘oral mucosal lesions’</a>, this is a very broad
    term.</p>
<p>Despite this broad range of conditions affecting the oral
    mucosa, there are a few unifying and shared aspects to
    the treatment modalities of many oral mucosal lesions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>many oral mucosal lesions carry a burden of
        considerable discomfort and pain; so adequate <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">pain
            control</a> is a common theme in the management
        of such conditions;</li>
    <li>many oral mucosal lesions carry an increased risk
        for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">oral
            infections</a>; so prevention and/or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">treatment
            of infections</a> is another common theme in the
        management of oral mucosal lesions;</li>
    <li>many oral mucosal lesions are a symptom of other
        underlying conditions and disorders; so
        collaborative treatment and management jointly with
        other medical specialties is a common management
        approach;</li>
    <li>many oral mucosal lesions have identifiable and
        avoidable causes; so identifying such causes and
        finding ways to avoid them in the future is yet
        another common ‘treatment’ modality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these general patterns of management of oral
    mucosal lesions, we outline in more detail treatment
    modalities and options for specific such conditions on
    the <a href="/">following page</a>.</p>
