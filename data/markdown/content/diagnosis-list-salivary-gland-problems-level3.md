    <p>If you’d like to know more about location and structure of
        the salivary glands, this information is in our section
        about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to read a concise summary of salivary gland
        anatomy and physiology alongside a description of the
        diagnostic toolbox commonly used in investigating salivary
        gland conditions, this information can be found <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-glands-summary">here</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="developmental-disorders">Developmental disorders</h1>
<p>Significant developmental disorders of the salivary glands are
    rare. Agenesis (absence) of one or more salivary glands has
    been described.</p>
<p>Heterotopic salivary tissue (salivary tissue occurring where
    it shouldn’t be) most commonly occurs in intra- and peri-parotid
    lymph nodes. It is of significance clinically when it presents
    as a mass, draining sinus, or neoplasm (newly formed). Stafne’s
    bone cavity occurs when heterotopic salivary tissue indents
    the mandible. The cavity is seen as a well corticated (with
    a hard, outer bone layer) radiolucency at the angle of the
    mandible below the inferior alveolar nerve canal.</p>
<p>Accessory (additional) salivary tissue adjacent to the glands
    is so common as to be normal.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">Cystic disease</a> may be developmental
    or acquired. Developmental cysts of the salivary glands are
    rare, the most common of these being the lymphoepithelial
    (consisting of lymphocytes and epithelial cells) cyst of
    the parotid gland.</p>
<h1 id="obstructive-disease">Obstructive disease</h1>
<p>Obstructions occur commonly in many of the body’s glands, including
    the salivary glands. The ductal system of the major salivary
    glands may be blocked by calculi (stones), mucus (thick secretions)
    or strictures (narrowing or other limitations).</p>
<p>Approximately 80 % of salivary calculi occur in the ductal system
    of the submandibular glands. This is due to the greater length
    of the duct, its upward course and the thicker mucus secreted
    by the submandibular glands. There will usually be a history
    of painful, recurrent swelling in the submandibular region,
    particularly associated with eating or the anticipation of
    eating (pre-prandial swelling). Plain (X-ray) radiography
    will usually demonstrate a calculus in the duct (see Figure
    1), or in the junction of the duct and gland or the gland
    itself (see Figure 2).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Calculi in the duct and the submandibular
        gland.  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the duct, a calculus is date shaped, at the junction of duct
    and gland it is comma shaped and in the gland it is round.
    Should a calculus not be visible on plain X-ray images, a
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">sialogram</a> is required
    which may demonstrate a radiolucent stone, a mucus plug or
    a stricture in the duct (see Figure 3).</p>

        useful diagnostically and therapeutically.  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Alternatively, a history of less severe symptoms with chronic
    obstruction can result in a fibrosed (scarred) gland. In
    either case there may be an acutely infected swollen gland.
    It is often the case that the submandibular gland will have
    suffered irreversible damage from a severe infection.</p>
<p>10 % of calculi occur in the parotid duct. Of these only 10 %
    are visible on plain (X-ray) radiographs. The substance obstructing
    the parotid may sometimes be inspissated (thick) mucus rather
    than a frank calculus. It may pass out as a string of jelly-like
    material, followed by relief of the symptoms. The parotid
    gland survives acute infective episodes much better than
    the submandibular gland.</p>
<p>The remaining 10 % of calculi occur in the sublingual and minor
    salivary glands.</p>
<h1 id="infections"><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">Infections</a></h1>
<h2>Acute bacterial sialadenitis (inflammation of a salivary gland)</h2>
<p>Now relatively rare, this condition usually affects the parotid
    gland. It is microbiologically different from infected obstructive
    sialadenitis (usually seen in the submandibular gland (see
    above) but also parotid). Classically it occurred in postoperative
    patients who were dehydrated. It still occurs in older patients
    who are dehydrated and debilitated but underlying Sjögren’s
    syndrome (see below) nowadays is a more frequent cause. There
    will be a swollen, erythematous (red skin), painful gland,
    often accompanied by systemic malaise (see Figure 4).
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">Staphylococcus aureus</a> is the usual organism, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">streptococci and other anaerobic bacteria</a>        are also frequently cultured.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Patient with bacterial sialadenitis.
        These patients can become very unwell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Pus may be discharging from the papilla (see Figure 5). If not,
    the gland should be milked to obtain pus for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microbiology</a>.
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">Abscess</a> formation may
    be a (rare) sequela (develop as a consequence of the initial
    condition).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Pus discharging at the parotid
        duct.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Following recovery from the acute phase a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">sialogram</a>    will be required to investigate any underlying abnormality
    and often this is therapeutic due to the mechanical irrigation
    with an antiseptic (the contrast agent usually contains iodine).</p>
<h2>Chronic bacterial sialadenitis</h2>
<p>This condition tends to affect the submandibular glands (probably
    due to the more viscous secretion being more difficult to
    clear than that of the parotid gland, and the propensity
    for calculi to form in the submandibular duct; see Figure
    6).  </p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Calculus at the submandibular
        duct orifice (opening).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Chronic bacterial sialadenitis usually occurs in a gland that
    has had a history of an acute infective or obstructive episode.</p>
<h2>Viral sialadenitis</h2>
<p>There are several viruses which can affect the salivary glands.
    By far the most common is the mumps virus (a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">paramyxovirus</a>).
    Mumps is usually a disease of childhood. There is acute swelling
    of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands,
    which are involved in 70 % of cases. The other glands may
    be affected less frequently. Immunity is lifelong but mumps
    may occur in non-immune adults. In males the testes are involved
    in 20 % of cases, resulting in sterility in 1 %.</p>
<p>The cytomegalovirus (a virus belonging to the group of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">herpes viruses</a>)
    affects the salivary glands in congenital cytomegalic inclusion
    disease. The seriousness of the involvement of other organs
    overshadows any clinical impact of salivary involvement.</p>
<h1 id="sjgrens-syndrome">Sjögren’s syndrome</h1>
<p>Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterised by
    a dry mouth (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>)
    and dry eyes. It occurs most commonly in middle or old age,
    with women being affected ten times as often as men. When
    a dry mouth and eyes occur in isolation it is termed primary
    Sjögren’s syndrome. When these symptoms occur in combination
    with a connective tissue disease it is termed secondary Sjögren’s
    syndrome. It is of interest that the ocular (eye) and oral
    (mouth) symptoms are usually more severe in primary Sjögren’s
    syndrome. The most commonly associated connective tissue
    diseases are rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis.
    Of those patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 15% report symptoms
    consistent with secondary Sjögren’s syndrome; for those with
    systemic lupus erythematosis the figure is 30 %.</p>
<p>A subjective feeling of a dry mouth may occur before changes
    are clinically evident and at this stage there may be no
    ocular symptoms. Early ophthalmological assessment is a good
    idea to check for the potentially sight compromising keratoconjuctivitis
    sicca (dry eye syndrome). As the salivary flow decreases
    the mucosa (lining of the mouth) takes on a dry and shiny
    appearance, with loss of papillae of the tongue. Diffuse
    non-painful parotid swelling is uncommon but 30 % of patients
    will give a history of such swelling.</p>
<p>There are various diagnostic tests. The <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    is important and a convincing history in the presence of
    an established connective tissue disease makes further investigation
    unnecessary. The mainstay of investigation is detection of
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">autoantibodies</a>    (most clinicians would test for rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro
    and anti-La factors). If blood tests are unhelpful and further
    diagnostic information is required, then salivary gland
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a> may be performed. This entails removing five minor
        salivary glands from the lower lip. The histological
        findings of periductal lymphocytic infiltrate (T-cells),
        duct ectasia (dilation) and acinar atrophy (deteriorated
        acinar (secreting) cells) are characteristic of Sjögren’s
        syndrome. The lymphocytic infiltrate progresses with
        the disease and eventually replaces the salivary tissue.
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other">Lymphoma (malignancy of the lymph nodes)</a>        formation is more likely than random occurrence in those
        with Sjögren’s syndrome and this risk is greater in primary
        Sjögren’s syndrome. The increased risk of lymphoma formation
        should be borne in mind should a lump develop in the
        parotid glands.</p>
<p>In those cases with a history of parotid swelling a sialogram
    will show a characteristic ‘snowstorm’ appearance of punctate
    sialectasis (spots of dilation of ducts) in Sjögren’s syndrome
    (see Figure 7). Decreased tear secretion can be measured
    objectively using small strips of paper placed in the lower
    eyelid (Schirmer’s test).</p>

<p>The majority of salivary gland tumours have no clearly defined
    cause although Warthin’s tumour (lymphadenoma) is associated
    with smoking.</p>
<p>Presentation of virtually all these tumours is that of a slow
    growing mass (see Figure 8).  </p>

<p>The majority of salivary gland tumours are benign, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">malignant tumours of the salivary glands</a>    are very rare.</p>
<p><strong>Pleomorphic salivary adenoma</strong> is the most common
    (benign) tumour of the salivary glands, 75 % of pleomorphic
    salivary adenomas occur in the parotid gland and the vast
    majority of those are in the superficial lobe. These tumours
    are thought to arise from duct and myoepithelial cells. They
    occur in equal proportion in men and women. The average age
    of presentation is around 40 years but they may present over
    a wide age range. The pleomorphic epithet (characteristic)
    arises from the mixed fibrous, myxoid, cartilaginous and
    epithelial components. Although benign, the pleomorphic salivary
    adenoma is poorly encapsulated and requires excision with
    a small margin of normal tissue.</p>
<p>There are many other benign tumours of the salivary glands, most
    of which are uncommon. Of note is the <strong>adenolymphoma (Warthin’s tumour)</strong>    which can be bilateral in up to 10% of patients. It is the
    only salivary gland tumour with an association with smoking
    and can sometimes vanish after FNAC (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">fine needle aspiration cytology</a>),
    aspiration or enucleation despite being ‘multifocal’ which
    raises questions as to the true nature of this ‘tumour’.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-conditions">Miscellaneous conditions</h1>
<p><strong>Necrotising sialometaplasia</strong> is a non-malignant
    condition of salivary gland tissue which clinically can appear
    to be a malignant tumour. It is a rare condition and occurs
    more commonly in men, usually in their 30s and 40s. The most
    common area is the palate and it presents as an ulcer. It
    has a short clinical course, with the ulcer appearing over
    a period of up to two weeks or so. This short history is
    a clue to diagnosis. Biopsy is mandatory to exclude carcinoma.
    Histopathologically the biopsy can be just as difficult to
    differentiate from cancer as the clinical appearance. The
    lesion heals by secondary intention (without intervention)
    in two to three months. More rapid healing can be obtained
    by excision with a small rim of normal mucosa and placement
    of a dressing plate with an obtundant (pain reducing) dressing.</p>
<p><strong>Drooling</strong> is almost never caused by excess saliva
    production (which itself is unusual) as the saliva can simply
    be <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowed</a>.
    Drooling is usually due to poor neuromuscular control of
    the lips or neck and head. The significance and severity
    of drooling varies widely, ranging from a temporary reaction
    to inflammation by teething in toddlers to severe effects
    in neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s or motor neuron
    disease.</p>
<p><strong>Sialadenosis</strong> is enlargement of the salivary
    glands. It usually occurs in the parotid glands and may be
    idiopathic (unknown cause) or associated with diabetes mellitus,
    alcoholism, drugs or pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Sarcoidosis</strong> is a reaction of the immune system,
    most likely triggered by inflammation. It leads to the formation
    of granulomas (multiple small lumps). This condition can
    occur everywhere in the body, it most commonly affects skin
    or lungs but may also affect the salivary glands, usually
    the parotids. If associated with lacrimal gland swelling,
    chorioretinitis (inflammation of the retina) and cranial
    nerve involvement it is termed Heerfordt’s disease.</p>
