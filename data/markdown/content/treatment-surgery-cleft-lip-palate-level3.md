<p>The general timing of surgery is <a href="/treatment/surgery/cleft-lip-palate">outlined
        on the previous page</a>. The precise details of the
    timing of surgery will vary depending on the individual
    patient and the treatment philosophy of the treating
    centre. The following discussion follows approximately
    the general timing patterns.</p>
<h1 id="lip-repair">Lip repair</h1>
<p>In general, neo-natal lip repair, that is very early lip
    repair has fallen into disrepute. Most surgeons will
    undertake lip repair between three and six months old.
    The classical rule was the rule of 10 which is still
    referred to (the child is 10 weeks old, 10 lb in weight,
    and has a <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">haemoglobin
        level</a> above 10 g/dl). In Germany the rule is
    that lip repair is not carried out before 3 months of
    age and not under 5 kg in weight. Usually at the age of
    3 months, babies are 7 or 8 kg in maximum weight.</p>
<p>Numerous different surgical techniques for lip repair
    have been described. Perhaps the most important
    principles are reconstitution of the orbicularis
    musculature (a group of muscles in the lip), with the
    appropriate muscle attachments, of the alar base (base
    part of the nose), restoration of the white role and
    vermilion border (margin of the lip) and respecting the
    boundaries of labial skin, nasal skin and oral mucosa
    (Figure 1).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The complex
        systems of muscles which have been disrupted by the
        clefting process. The aim is to reattach and restore
        function.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some of the main controversies in this area of surgery
    are whether release and advancement of the muscle, skin
    and mucosa should be achieved by subperiosteal
    undermining or supraperiosteal undermining. The use of
    skin lengthening cuts by geometric design which
    transgress the actual skin boundaries or the allowance
    of the re-imposed muscle to stretch the skin within the
    natural skin boundaries is another area of controversy
    (Figure 2 and Figure 3).</p>

</figure>
<p>Dissection of the alar cartilage should be carried out to
    allow its repositioning, but there is controversy over
    the extent of cartilaginous dissection and so-called
    primary rhinoplasty, and some controversy remains over
    the use of a mucosal flap from the vomer (bony part of
    the septum of the nose) in order to reinforce the floor
    of the nasal cavity.</p>
<h1 id="palate-repair">Palate repair</h1>
<p>The technique popularised by Delaire undertook soft
    palate repair at the same time as lip repair to allow
    functional moulding of the residual cleft in the hard
    palate. This may or may not be practised, depending on
    the centre where the child is operated. Primary bone
    grafting of the alveolus has generally fallen into
    disrepute.</p>
<p>Closure of the palate in the UK is generally done
    relatively early. The principle here is to attempt to
    close the palate before the development of speech and a
    hypernasal speech pattern. In some European countries,
    closure of the hard palate is delayed in order to
    minimise the unwanted effects of early surgery upon
    growth. This delay may improve transverse growth of the
    maxilla but there is an obvious compromise in terms of
    speech development. In Germany, there are also many
    different concepts concerning sequence and timing of the
    operation. The common opinion is that the palate should
    be closed at the age of 2 years at the latest.</p>
<p><strong>Palatal closure</strong> by common consensus is
    now carried out using techniques which leave minimum
    stripped palatal mucoperiosteum and exposed bone in an
    attempt to decrease scarring and the unwanted effects on
    growth (Figure 4 and Figure 5).</p>

        closure of the cleft hard palate by using a

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The second layer
        closes the oral mucosa and reinforces the

</figure>
<h1 id="primary-dentition-and-speech-assessment">Primary dentition and speech assessment</h1>
<p>The development of the primary dentition should be
    allowed to progress essentially naturally with good
    paediatric dentistry in order to maintain space. No
    orthodontic intervention in the primary dentition is
    warranted, but good preventive dentistry is. A joint
    ear, nose and throat and speech therapy assessment
    should be carried out to detect middle ear effusions
    (glue ear) and appropriate development of speech
    patterns. Hypernasal speech and / or glue ear should be
    addressed, either by therapy or surgery such as
    pharyngoplasty or myringotomy (for glue ear).</p>
<h1 id="mixed-dentition">Mixed dentition</h1>
<p>At this stage the growth-retarding effects of initial
    surgery become more evident, seen predominately
    transversely in the upper arch and then
    anteroposteriorly as growth in this dimension
    predominates with age. The eruption of the permanent
    incisors demonstrates defects in enamel formation and
    position, and the upper incisors may erupt into lingual
    occlusion. Orthodontic preparation for alveolar bone
    grafting (see below) can usefully be combined with
    limited alignment of the incisors in the mixed
    dentition. Operation for alveolar bone grafting
    generally requires expansion of the maxillary arch and
    preferably alignment of the segments. There is an
    advantage to increasing the size of the alveolar defect.
    This allows adequate working space within the defect to
    recreate the nasal floor and oral mucosal layer, with
    cancellous (spongy) bone sandwiched between the two
    layers and the anterior component closed by a sliding
    buccal mucosal flap.</p>
<h1 id="alveolar-bone-grafting">Alveolar bone grafting</h1>
<p>This technique provides bone through which a permanent
    canine and lateral incisor can erupt into the arch. The
    procedure unifies the maxilla providing a stable intact
    arch, improves the alar base support, closes the
    residual oronasal <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistula</a> and
    provides a palatal base for later <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic
        surgery</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Initial assessment</strong> for alveolar bone
    grafting should be carried out at the age of 8 years as
    in rare instances it may be possible to graft to allow
    an intact lateral incisor to erupt. More commonly the
    lateral incisor is rudimentary or missing or may have to
    be removed as part of the bone grafting procedure. In
    this instance the actual timing of the bone graft is
    predicated on the state of development of the canine
    tooth</p>
<p>Collaboration with the orthodontist on this is essential,
    both in terms of timing of the bone graft and in terms
    of arch expansion and stabilisation of the maxilla.
    Particularly in cases of bilateral alveolar bone
    grafting, the premaxilla should be stabilised with a
    heavy arch wire and either a tri- or quad-helix (a heavy
    wire orthodontic appliance). This provides optimum
    stability for the grafted bone. Preoperative removal of
    deciduous teeth and visible <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">supernumerary
        teeth</a> six weeks prior to alveolar bone grafting
    creates healthy attached gingivae and optimises the flap
    design.</p>
<p><strong>The technique of alveolar bone grafting</strong>
    involves outlining a buccal lesser flap and a major
    segment flaps. The flap in the major segment is a
    mini-flap. Subperiosteal dissection exposes the cleft
    and the lining of the oronasal fistula is incised to
    create two upper nasal flaps and two lower palatal
    flaps. These flaps are sutured to create a pyramidal
    shaped defect now lined by mucosa superiorly and
    inferiorly. This defect has either periosteum or bone on
    all its margins at this point, except for the base which
    is the labial aspect. The defect is then packed with
    bone which may be trephined or harvested by an open
    procedure from the iliac crest (hip) or the tibia (lower
    leg) (Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-cleft-lip-palate-level3-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The periosteum
        and bone-lined defect, packed with bone.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Skull and chin bone are popular in some centres. The bone
    used should be cancellous bone as this has the greatest
    propensity to become alveolar bone and allow migration
    of the canine through it. There is no good evidence to
    support the use of synthetic materials for this
    procedure. The periosteum of the lesser segment (larger)
    buccal flap is then incised and advanced to close the
    labial defect. It is important to remember that bone
    will not take against exposed cementum. Therefore, any
    obviously exposed root (for example from a supernumerary
    tooth or a residual lateral incisor), should result in
    removal of that tooth, rather than compromising the bone
    graft (Figure 7).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The long-term
        result; surgery without orthodontics is a waste of
        time. Here the teeth have been aligned after palate
        and alveolus repair.</figcaption>

    nasally) and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">local
        analgesia</a> at donor and recipient site both
    improve success and comfort.</p>
<h1 id="permanent-dentition">Permanent dentition</h1>
<p>The establishment of the permanent dentition, including
    guiding of the canines, which have to be exposed in
    about 15 % of cases, is basically a decision as to
    whether orthodontic camouflage or <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic
        surgery</a> is indicated. If orthognathic surgery is
    indicated, standard orthodontic decompensation is
    carried out and the osteotomies are relatively
    conservative antero-posterior movements. The chances of
    advancing a cleft maxilla further than 7 mm <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">without
        significant relapse</a> is very small (Figure 8,
    left) and it is customary to balance the movements in
    the maxilla and the mandible (Figure 8, right) in order
    to achieve an optimum facial balance and occlusion. Once
    the maxilla is stabilised, further completion surgery
    can be carried out.</p>

</figure>
<h1 id="rhinoplasty">Rhinoplasty</h1>
<p><a href="/treatment-surgery-facial-appearance-level2">Rhinoplasty</a>
    should be performed at the end of treatment rather than
    as an intermediary, because the final position of the
    nose can only be predicted once the maxilla is in a
    stable position. Open rhinoplasty techniques have been
    popularised in addressing the cleft nose principally
    because the dome of the nose, made up from alar
    cartilage is frequently bifid and the collumella (bottom
    part of the septum of the nose) is short. This allows
    access to the alar cartridges of the dome to allow
    primary refashioning and suturing.</p>
