<p>Missing teeth in a maxillofacial context may result as a consequence
    of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer">management of cancer</a> or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>.
        The replacement of teeth lies firmly in the field of
        <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative and general dentistry</a>.</p>
<p>The interaction between the surgical specialty of oral and maxillofacial
    surgery and the dental specialty of restorative dentistry
    (which may form a large part of the work of a general dentist)
    principally centres around the planning of which teeth can
    be usefully retained and preserved <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-pretreatment">after treatment of mouth cancer</a>    and the provision of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">implants</a>.</p>
<p>If one is unfortunate enough to lose a tooth or teeth, the timelines
    can vary substantially. If there is a planned process of
    <a href="/treatment-surgery-preprothetic-surgery-level1">atraumatic extraction</a> followed by immediate restoration
        with a prosthesis or implant, then the process may be
        immediate with only a week or so of recovery and adapting
        to the replacement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the missing teeth are a manifestation of
    the treatment of a mouth cancer, final dental rehabilitation
    may not be safely completed until up to a year after the
    start of treatment. This reflects the potential risks of
    dental prosthesis being placed on irradiated mucosa when
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> was part of the treatment.</p>
<p>In summary, the variations in timelines for dental rehabilitation
    after a range of oral and maxillofacial interventions are
    so wide that it is best to ask the clinician what applies
    in any given individual situation.</p>
