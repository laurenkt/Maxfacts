<p>Postoperative problems affecting the lower leg include</p>
<ul>
    <li>A visible scar. This is along the length of the outer surface
        of the lower leg usually with a rectangular area of altered
        appearance where a skin graft replaces skin taken when
        a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">fibula osseocutaneous flap</a>        has been taken to reconstruct the jaws. The inner side
        of the lower leg may have a linear scar if a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">medial sural artery perforator flap</a>        has been harvested.</li>
    <li>Lifting up of the great toe can be limited when a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">fibula flap</a>        has been used.</li>
    <li>Limping to a greater or lesser degree can occur.</li>
    <li>Altered or absent sensation in the area of surgery may be
        noticeable although this often isnâ€™t very troublesome.</li>
    <li>Complete absence of sensation or sometimes unpleasant
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">altered sensation</a> on the outer surface of the lowest
            part of the leg and the side of the foot, if a
            <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">sural nerve graft</a> has been taken to replace missing
                or damaged nerve elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Very rarely loss of the foot has been reported when a fibula
        flap has been used and the remaining blood vessels to
        the lower leg and foot (the anterior (front) and posterior
        (back) tibial arteries) have been diseased or absent.
        This is why pre-operative assessment of the leg usually
        with MRA (magnetic resonance angiography), an application
        of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> for the characterisation
        of blood vessels) or some other combination of tests
        is carried out.</li>
</ul>
