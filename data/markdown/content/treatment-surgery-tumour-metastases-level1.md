<p>A brief summary of the role of oral and maxillofacial
    surgery in the management of metastatic malignancies
    appears to be a straightforward narrative, describing a
    situation where maxillofacial surgery</p>
<ul>
    <li>supports the treatment / management of distant
        metastases from solid tumours elsewhere in the body
        that manifest in the head &amp; neck region, similar
        to the maxillofacial surgery support role in the <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/blood-malignancy">management
            and treatment of haematological
            malignancies</a>;</li>
    <li>manages and treats regional (neck) and distant
        (below the line of the collar bone) metastases
        originating from head &amp; neck malignancies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two arms of activity include all aspects of
    maxillofacial surgery when confronted with metastatic
    disease. Another way to briefly summarise the role of
    maxillofacial surgery in these circumstances would be to
    simply say that the role is to manage disease
    progression.</p>
<p>However, what is invisible in these brief summaries are
    the numerous difficulties encountered when having to
    deal with metastatic disease. These include diagnostic
    challenges associated with previous treatment(s),
    difficult decisions about the best treatment options
    (which are individually different), difficult
    conversations and processes when faced with disease
    progression, tumour recurrence or a second local primary
    tumour (or combinations of these conditions), sometimes
    metastatic disease may well be an issue from the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">initial
        diagnosis</a> because head and neck malignancies are
    often diagnosed and identified at an advanced stage. It
    is common that important decisions have to be made at a
    time of serious distress, and a holistic approach
    including <a href="/help/mental-health/getting-started">mental
        health issues</a> and support is key to arrive at
    sound decisions, care and treatment planning.</p>
<p>Treatment planning for metastatic disease does need to
    include decisions about treatment with curative intent,
    or opting for <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care/more-info">palliative
        treatment</a> modalities. The available treatment
    modalities are broadly the same as those on offer for
    initial treatment of a primary tumour and include</p>
<ul>
    <li>(salvage) <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>;
    </li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>,
        possibly combined with some form(s) of</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>;
    </li>
    <li>increasingly <a href="/treatment-other-new-developments-immunotherapies-level1">immunotherapies</a>
        are being used in the palliative treatment of some
        head &amp; neck malignancies.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understand that a decision for or
    against treatment option(s) is a highly individual
    matter, for technical reasons as well as for reasons of
    patient priorities and preferences. It is important to
    understand that broader issues of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases/more-info">metastasis
        in maxillofacial malignancies</a> are slightly
    different from most other malignancies, because of the
    special anatomical conditions in the head &amp; neck
    region. It is further important to understand the
    palliative nature of some treatment schemes, even if
    major surgery may be involved. One should not be tempted
    to think that interventions other than supportive care
    are always offered / carried out with curative intent.

        neck, in particular about the dense network of lymph
        nodes in that region, this information is on our

        issues afflicting maxillofacial patients at all
        stages of disease and treatment, this is discussed

    <p>If you’d like to read more about (early) palliative
        care in general, and about end-of-life care in the
        context of maxillofacial malignancies, this is

<p>The following pages try to help with making difficult
    treatment decisions. First of all, honest and in-depth
    communication between all involved is of fundamental
    importance to arrive at the individually best
    decision(s). Equally important is proper knowledge and
    understanding of the conditions and corresponding,
    realistic treatment options. These aspects are discussed
    in more detail on the following pages.</p>
