<p>The timelines for resolution (where possible) for bone lesions
    is reflected by the original pathology and the treatment.
    These are very general guidelines and the process will be
    quite specific to the individual and their condition.</p>
<h1 id="infections-inflammatory-and-other-non-neoplastic-bone-lesions">Infections, inflammatory and other non-neoplastic bone lesions</h1>
<h2>Dry socket (alveolar osteitis)</h2>
<p>This frustratingly painful condition tends to fully resolve in
    7 to 10 days. It may rarely persist as some form of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">osteomyelitis</a>    which can then be quite unpredictable.</p>
<h2>Osteomyelitis</h2>
<p><strong>Acute osteomyelitis</strong> generally improves dramatically
    over a few days <a href="/treatment-surgery-bone-lesions">after effective treatment</a>    but it is not unusual for complete resolution to take up
    to 2 weeks with an aching discomfort associated with the
    area affected.</p>
<p>If <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">pathological fractures</a>    are associated with osteomyelitis, rigid fixation is shown
    to improve healing. This creates a second insult to the healing
    jaw and although the symptoms are initially dramatically
    improved, associated swelling and discomfort can add an additional
    week to healing. If there is association <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">nerve damage</a>    this may be symptomatic for many months.</p>
<p>There are a range of <strong>chronic osteomyelitis</strong> conditions.
    The common guiding principle in the healing process seems
    to be that it is lengthy and frustrating with apparent healing
    followed by periods of hard to explain return of symptoms.
    This is unfortunate but most people do seem to gradually
    improve in the long term (months to years).</p>
<p><strong>Garré’s sclerosing osteomyelitis</strong> is a frustrating
    and unpredictable condition, affecting mostly young people.
    It does eventually resolve after <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion/more-info">treatment</a>    and does not seem to progress in adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis</strong> is very unpredictable
    with little real understanding of the underlying pathological
    mechanisms. <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion/more-info">Treatment</a>    is often along common sense guidelines and ‘in hope’. Symptom-free
    periods can be blighted by relapse even after years of apparent
    ‘cure’. The real problems are the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">management of pain</a>,
    which may be due to some form of autonomic nerve dysfunction
    (a degree of malfunction of involuntary nerve actions) and
    the maintenance of a positive attitude in the face of a very
    frustrating and currently hard to explain condition.</p>
<h2>Cysts</h2>
<p>Despite the huge variation in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">types of jaw bone cysts</a>    they are usually managed by <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">simple enucleation</a>.
    These heal symptomatically within a week or two (depending
    on size and degree of surgery), and the cavity gradually
    fills with normal bone over a 6 month period. <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">Marsupialised cysts</a>    follow essentially the same course but are more irritating
    because of the connection with the mouth.</p>
<h2>Fibrous dysplasia and ossifying fibroma</h2>
<p>Substantial swelling taking 2 to 3 weeks to fully resolve is
    the usual problem associated with bone re-sculpting or excision
    of an ossifying fibroma. Long term, the main issue is recurrence
    of areas affected by fibrous dysplasia.</p>
<h2>Osteopetrosis</h2>
<p>An awareness of the condition and the possibility of the need
    for intervention at some point in life is the most pertinent
    point.</p>
<h2>Paget’s disease of bone</h2>
<p>Another life long condition where an awareness of the condition
    is probably the only predictable feature in terms of timelines.</p>
<h1 id="benign-neoplastic-bone-lesions-benign-bone-tumours">Benign neoplastic bone lesions (benign bone tumours)</h1>
<h2>Ameloblastoma</h2>
<p>The timeline will vary depending on the degree of surgical intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Unicystic ameloblastoma</strong> treated by <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">enucleation</a>    responds and follows a healing course much like that of a
    large cyst. Recurrence is relatively unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>Multilocular ameloblastoma</strong> may be treated by
    resection which will involve a longer healing period than
    simple enucleation (2 to 4 weeks). There will be a direct
    effect on chewing if teeth in the area of the resection are
    included and may, rarely, be complicated by a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    which will have its own timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Other odontogenic benign tumours</strong> (such as adenoameloblastoma,
    myxoma, or ameloblastic fibroma) are all extremely rare.
    They are all managed by conservative excision and follow
    a similar healing path to ameloblastoma.</p>
<h1 id="bizarre-parosteal-osteochondromatous-proliferation-noras-lesion">Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (Nora’s lesion)</h1>
<p>A rare condition, which may follow a simple path like <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion/more-info">excision of a torus</a>    or be as complicated as chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis
    (see above).</p>
<h2>Giant cell granuloma of bone</h2>
<p>Simple excision usually heals with minimal residual symptoms
    within 2 to 4 weeks.</p>
<h2>Osteoma / Gardner’s syndrome / Torus</h2>
<p>These entirely benign <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bony exostoses</a>    are excised and heal uneventfully within a few weeks, but
    swelling is to be expected which can be quite dramatic for
    the first few days, then more slowly settles over a period
    of 10 to 14 days.</p>
<h1 id="malignant-neoplastic-bone-lesions-bone-cancers">Malignant neoplastic bone lesions (bone cancers)</h1>
<p><strong>Sarcoma</strong>, the malignant conditions affecting
    connective tissue are managed essentially along the same
    lines as soft tissue cancers of the head and neck. Liposarcoma
    follows the <a href="/treatment/timelines/cancer/mouth-cancer">same timeline as mouth cancer</a>    with the exception that <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    is not usually involved.</p>
<p><strong>Osteosarcoma</strong>, the malignant conditions affecting
    the jaw bones has a degree of controversy as pre-operative
    <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> is used
    for long-bone sarcoma but has never been proven to be of
    survival benefit (and if poorly handled can delay definitive
    surgery). However the data is conflicting and generally of
    poor quality.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a planned trial of pre-operative chemotherapy the
    effectiveness (or otherwise) of which can be confirmed on
    the resected specimen all carried out as part of a planned
    timeline would make sense and is practiced in some centres.
    This would usually involve two cycles of chemotherapy, closely
    monitored, followed by planned <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">ablative and reconstructive surgery</a>    which is effectively the same as that for <a href="/treatment-suregery-mouth-cancer-level1">mouth cancer</a>.
    Timelines for these conditions are included in the discussion
    of timelines for <a href="/treatment/timelines/cancer/mouth-cancer">mouth cancer</a>,
    and timelines for the treatment of <a href="/treatment/timelines/tumour/metastases">tumour metastases</a>.</p>
<p>If the chemotherapy has resulted in necrotic tumour in the excised
    specimen, it may be continued; if not and the surgical margins
    are clear there is no justifiable reason to run further risk
    of chemotherapy-induced unwanted effects such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">neuropathies</a>.
    The only disadvantage to this approach is if the chemotherapy
    is ineffective and/or produces adverse effects, definitive
    surgery (which is the primary curative treatment) has been
    delayed.</p>
