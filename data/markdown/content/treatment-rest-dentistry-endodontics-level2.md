<p>There is more than one reason why root canal treatment may become
    necessary.</p>
<p>The most common reason is due to death of the pulp of the tooth.
    The pulp runs through the centre of the roots of a tooth,
    and contains blood vessels, connective tissue and nerves.
    Once the nerve of the tooth dies, the pulp starts to break
    down causing products that discolour the tooth. This can
    explain why some dead teeth are noticeably darker. When the
    pulp is broken down, bacteria can move in to this space and
    eventually reach the tip of the tooth (the apex). The bacteria
    can cause <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>    at the apex, resulting in pain on biting but as the nerve
    is dead there is no sensitivity to cold or heat. This is
    known as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">apical periodontitis</a>.
    An <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a> may form,
    where the space at the apex becomes filled with pus (bacteria
    and white bloods cells trying to fight the infection) which
    can be extremely painful and severely tender to bite on.
    Once the nerve of the tooth is dead, the treatment options
    are to remove the dead tissue and replace it with a dental
    material (root canal treatment) or remove the tooth.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">Antibacterial agents</a>    are only indicated if the infection causes systemic illness,
    if the infection is too large to successfully apply <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">anaesthetics</a>    (pus is very acidic which can occasionally reduce the effectiveness
    of local anaesthetics used), or if there is another reason
    why treatment is not possible at the time (such as severely
    reduced mouth opening (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>),
    or any other medical contraindications to treatment). Antibacterial
    agents do not treat <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a>    and will not prevent the abscess reforming.</p>
<p>Another reason why root canal treatment may become necessary
    is following trauma. If a tooth has been knocked out, cracked
    or severely damaged, sometimes a root canal treatment is
    needed to help prevent future infection and prolong the life
    of the tooth. In these circumstances an alive tooth may be
    root treated. Orthodontic treatment can occasionally have
    an unwanted result of pulp inflammation and death.</p>
<p>If a tooth is very broken down and if somebody is having a denture
    made, it may be a good idea to keep the root of the tooth
    to sit underneath this. This may seem odd but it can retain
    alveolar bone and add some support for the denture (improving
    retention). This normally involves root canal treatment for
    the root and a filling material to seal the top of it, a
    couple of millimeters above the gum level. The denture then
    covers this up.</p>
<p>Root canal treatments seem to have a bad reputation. This is
    probably because it is a treatment option for a very painful,
    infected tooth. Most patients tolerate root canal treatment
    very well with no pain at all, once appropriate local anaesthetics
    are in place. Root canal treatments can require multiple
    appointments, especially in severe infections.</p>
<p>Once the tooth is prepared, a small hole is cut in the top or
    back of the tooth (unless access can be gained through a
    cavity once all of the decay is cleared), and the pulp of
    the tooth is found. A drill is used to do this, in the same
    way as preparing the tooth for filling material. The pulp
    is then removed with very thin files (either twisted round
    by hand or by a rotary machine). Lots of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics/more-info">chemicals</a>    are used to wash out the inside of the tooth and clean out
    any bacteria present. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiographs</a>    are needed at several stages throughout root canal treatment
    to ensure the files and materials are in the correct place.</p>
<p>Once the pulp is removed, the empty space is shaped to make it
    ideal for filling with whichever material the dentist or
    endodontist is going to use. Files are used for this as well
    and sometimes a small electronic device known as an apex
    locator is used to help the clinician locate the tip of the
    tooth (as this cannot be seen by looking at the tooth from
    the outside). Once shaped, the empty and clean canal space
    can be filled with one of several available materials. An
    example of this is gutta percha, which is a tough plastic
    substance from the latex of a specific tree. This can be
    inserted as small sticks of material or injected inside the
    tooth in a runny form. The aim is to seal the whole pulp
    chamber and prevent further bacteria getting inside.</p>
<p>After a root canal treatment, it is essential that the tooth
    is appropriately restored. Usually, a dental crown is necessary
    to strengthen the tooth and occasionally filling material
    is enough to restore the tooth. Root canal treatments are
    successful in many cases and sometimes re-treatment is possible
    if a root-treated tooth gets infected. Some dentists do root
    canal treatments using a microscope to allow them better
    visualization of the inside of the tooth and there are advanced
    ways to image the tooth (such as a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">cone beam CT scan</a>)
    which are useful in some cases.</p>

<p>Key risks of this treatment are instruments fracturing inside
    the tooth, re-infection, failure of treatment, multiple appointments
    are common and there may be obstructions inside the pulp
    canal which means the filling material cannot be optimally
    inserted into the space, reducing the chance of success of
    the treatment.</p>
