<p>When a tooth is lost, the decision may be made to replace it.
    The choice will depend on whether the loss of the tooth affects
    the way you function (such as eating and speaking) or the
    way you look (for example a tooth at the very front of your
    mouth). Even the way in which the tooth is lost may be relevant;
    a traumatically avulsed (knocked out) tooth may be best managed
    by an immediate implant whereas one lost through advanced
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal (gum) disease</a>    would not.</p>
<p>Not every lost tooth needs to be replaced and there are risks
    associated with the replacement options. One fixed option
    for some patients is a dental implant. Not everyone is suitable
    to have a dental implant, therefore a detailed examination
    is required to work out whether you are able to have one.
    Some medical conditions and medications will prevent you
    having a dental implant. Smoking or active gum disease are
    relative contraindications as the process is less likely
    to be successful.</p>
<p>Dental implants are metal posts which are screwed in to the jaw
    bone, they then normally have a false tooth on top of them
    which can be seen inside the mouth. They are usually made
    of titanium and sometimes have a coating to improve the way
    they heal in to the jaw bone. The surgeon will choose the
    right shape and style of implant to fit the space where it
    is being inserted before starting the treatment.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">Local anaesthetic</a>    is used to make the area completely numb before starting.
    There will be strange sounds and feelings during the treatment,
    but it shouldn’t be painful.</p>
<p>Normally, a small cut in the gum is made to move it out of the
    way, to prevent it from tearing. Then, a screw is drilled
    in to the jaw bone. This forms the new tooth ‘root’. The
    gum will be stitched back over and left to heal. A few months
    later, a false tooth can be put on top of the implant screw.
    In some circumstances the false tooth will be added immediately,
    other times the healing period is delayed. This is a complex
    decision in some situations and your surgeon will make this
    decision with you. Implants can still get infected (peri-implantitis),
    in the same way as a real tooth, therefore they must be kept
    extremely clean and regular dental assessments are recommended
    for maintenance.</p>
