<p>We want to encourage you to take good care of the hygiene of
    your mouth – this is one area where you yourself can easily
    make a substantial contribution to regain and to maintain
    your wellbeing! This statement goes far beyond the obvious,
    such as the prevention of dental decay or periodontal disease.</p>
<p>Some of the everyday-type brushing techniques demonstrated in
    the videos may not be suitable for everybody, for example
    if you are having problems with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">mouth opening</a>.</p>
<p>If you are recovering from major oral or maxillofacial surgery
    and are on a <a href="/help/oral-food">liquid or soft diet</a>    or are depending on a <a href="/help/non-oral-food">feeding tube</a>,
    regardless of whether you have natural teeth or not, please
    do remember that the ‘automatic’ self-cleaning mechanisms
    in the mouth for soft tissue, such as the surface of the
    tongue, do not work well under such circumstances. Gentle
    cleaning will not do any harm (teeth as well as soft tissues),
    quite in contrast: for example, it helps prevent (or combat)
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">thrush</a> and strongly
    supports the recovery of the function of your <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste buds</a>,
    on the back of the tongue. And these are vital in encouraging
    you to want to eat as the sense of taste triggers your appetite!</p>
<p>Have a look at our video demonstrations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos/brushing">Brushing teeth</a></li>
    <li><a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos/interdental-cleaning">Interdental cleaning</a></li>
    <li><a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos/interspace">Interspace brushes</a></li>
    <li><a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos/dentures">Care of dentures (and some obturators)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Try to look at some of the video material as an inspiration how
    you might be able to work around a problem. Some tools (such
    as tiny interspace brushes or soft foam lollipops) may be
    useful for more than one purpose. Also, people are quite
    good at inventing interesting alternatives if the common
    / standard approach doesn’t work – please <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos/feedback">let us know</a>    about your inventions and tricks so that we can share these
    widely.</p>
<p>Do <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos/feedback">let us know</a>    if you find oral hygiene demonstrations in videos useful
    and / or if we should add more specific, further videos to
    the collection.</p>
