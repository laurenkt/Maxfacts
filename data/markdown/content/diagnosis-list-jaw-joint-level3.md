<h1 id="temporomandibular-joint-pain-dysfunction-syndrome-tmjpds">Temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome (TMJPDS)</h1>
<p>This is a descriptive term (which often means very little is
    known about it) relating to pain arising from the joint itself
    and the muscles of mastication. It is also known as facial
    arthromyalgia and myofacial pain.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that up to 70% of the population have,
    at some time, experienced at least one episode of painful
    symptoms that can be attributed to TMJ dysfunction.</p>
<p>The aetiology of TMJPDS is unknown, although stress, often associated
    with ‘parafunctional habits’ such as bruxism (teeth clenching)
    are common features. Headaches, neck ache and back pains
    are also commonly seen with this condition. Abnormalities
    in occlusion have long been held responsible for TMJPDS,
    but this is controversial and the evidence for this is conflicting.
    There does appear to be a subgroup of people who do benefit
    from correction of a malocclusion; however this is certainly
    not the case in all people. Furthermore, it is important
    to identify TMJPDS in people who are about to undergo orthognathic
    surgery (corrective jaw surgery) as in a proportion of these,
    surgery or even orthodontics will make things worse.</p>
<p>Three cardinal features exist:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pain</li>
    <li>joint noise</li>
    <li>restricted movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Pain is the most common complaint and is by far the most difficult
    component to assess. It is characterised clinically by pain
    in and around the jaw joint, involving the muscles of mastication,
    and often radiating to the temple, jaw and into the neck.
    Patients often describe a dull, deep ache around the joint,
    which may resemble ‘earache’, along with a superimposed sharper
    component, which may radiate over the side of the face. Clicking
    of the joints with limitation of the range of mouth opening
    is also commonly reported. Joint noises, however, are quite
    common in asymptomatic people in the general population.
    Joint noises are of little clinical importance in the absence
    of pain. When mechanical symptoms predominate, the term ‘internal
    derangement’ (see below) is sometimes used, implying that
    there is a problem with the meniscus. However clicking is
    a common finding in the normal population and in the absence
    of other symptoms does not need treatment.</p>
<p>Clinical examination includes assessment for tenderness in the
    muscles of mastication (see Figure 1).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Clinical examination of muscles
        of mastication.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Areas of tenderness, trigger points, and patterns of pain referral
    should be noted. The examiner places their fingertips in
    the preauricular region just in front of the tragus of the
    ear and asks the patient to open and close the mouth – the
    fingertip should fall into a depression left by the translating
    condyle. The examination also includes listening for joint
    sounds. Mandibular function is assessed by noting whether
    the mouth opens in a straight line or deviates with jerky
    movements. Normal painless maximal opening should be around
    40-55 mm.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of TMJPDS is essentially based on clinical grounds.
    A history of limited mouth opening, which may be intermittent
    or progressive, is a key feature of temporomandibular disorders.</p>
<p>TMJPDS needs to be distinguished from other possible conditions;
    differential diagnosis:</p>
<ul>
    <li>dental pain</li>
    <li>disorders of the ears, nose, and sinuses</li>
    <li>neuralgias</li>
    <li>headaches</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">diseases of the major salivary glands</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="internal-derangement">Internal derangement</h1>
<p>As far back as 1992 the Consensus Conference for Temporomandibular
    Surgery defined internal derangement as ‘a localised mechanical
    fault in the joint which interferes with its smooth action’.
    To complicate matters, however, internal derangement may
    also occur together with TMJPDS (see above). It is essential
    therefore that the contribution of each condition to the
    symptoms is assessed because one disorder may benefit from
    surgery, whereas the other will not.</p>
<p>Normally when the mouth opens and closes the meniscus moves in
    harmony with the condyle as it translates along the articular
    eminence. In certain circumstances, however, this gliding
    movement is disrupted and the disk may become adherent to
    the fossa either by fibrous adhesions or by the so-called
    ‘suction cup effect’. The disk may also change shape. As
    a result the mandibular condyle is unable to move smoothly
    and may have to ‘jump’ over the periphery of the disk in
    order to continue moving. This movement is felt as a click.</p>
<p>Why the disk becomes sticky in the first place is not known.
    There is, however, a mounting body of evidence suggesting
    that changes in the consistency of the synovial fluid as
    a result of inflammatory processes may be responsible. This
    may occur as a result of chronic pressure applied to the
    joint (for example, resulting from constant bruxism (teeth
    grinding).</p>
<p>Untreated, clicking may, but not always, progress to locking,
    in which the disk becomes so abnormally shaped and displaced
    that it effectively acts like a door-stop, preventing the
    mandibular condyle from undertaking a full range of movements.
    This results in ‘locking’ of the jaw which may occur on either
    opening or closing of the mouth (open lock, closed lock;
    see Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint/detailed/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>        image demonstrating an anteriorly displaced temporomandibular
        joint meniscus with the teeth in occlusion (closed lock).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Pain may result from reflex muscle spasm or arise from the joint
    itself. It has been suggested that in susceptible patients,
    alterations in the synovial fluid can also result in a destructive
    arthropathy. These biochemical changes are similar to those
    seen in depression, and this helps to explain why improvement
    in symptoms can occur in patients who are <i>not</i> depressed
    and who take tricyclic anti-depressant drugs.</p>
<p>A classification system of internal derangement (based on arthrographic
    findings) was produced and includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Class I:</strong> painless clicking; no restricted
        motion; slight forward displacement of the disc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Class II:</strong> occasional painful clicking; intermittent
        locking; headaches; slight forward displacement of disc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Class III:</strong> frequent pain; joint tenderness;
        headaches; locking; restricted motion; painful chewing;
        anterior disc displacement</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Class IV:</strong> chronic pain; headaches; restricted
        motion; early to moderate degenerative changes; flattening
        of eminence; deformed condylar head; sclerosis</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Class V:</strong> variable pain; joint crepitus;
        painful function; disc perforation; gross anatomic deformity
        of disc and hard tissues with degenerative arthritic
        changes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="osteoarthrosis">Osteoarthrosis</h1>
<p>Osteoarthrosis has been described as a degenerative (wear and
    tear) disease that commonly affects weight-bearing joints
    such as the hips and knees. However, more recently the underlying
    pathology has been questioned, and a degenerative cause is
    not so clear-cut. Osteoarthrosis is now believed to be a
    systemic disease with trauma only contributing on the onset
    of symptoms. Nevertheless, changes of osteoarthrosis can
    be detected in the temporomandibular joint at <i>post mortem</i>    examination in over 40 % of middle-aged and elderly patients.
    Radiographically osteoarthrosis is often a common incidental
    finding. Despite this frequency, osteoarthrosis seldom causes
    symptoms. Clicking and limitation of movement are the most
    common symptoms; however, pain is unusual unless advanced.
    X-ray radiographs of the mandibular condyle show the typical
    changes of osteoarthrosis, namely osteophytic lipping and
    small subarticular radiolucent areas. As the condition progresses
    the articular surfaces become flattened, the articular cartilage
    becomes less elastic and cracks appear in the underlying
    bone. In localised areas there may be loss of cartilage with
    eburnation (a particular degenerative condition) of bone.</p>
<p>Symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>crepitus</li>
    <li>difficulty in chewing</li>
    <li>reduced mouth opening</li>
    <li>chronic pain</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rheumatoid-arthritis">Rheumatoid arthritis</h1>
<p>This is a multisystem disease which predominately affects the
    joints; most commonly the hands, wrists and elbows. Progressive
    damage and significant symptoms tend to be uncommon in the
    temporomandibular joint (less than 5 %). Of these the most
    common symptoms are crepitus and restriction of mouth opening.
    Rheumatoid arthritis undergoes acute phases of exacerbation,
    followed by quiescent periods. Histologically there is overgrowth
    of the synovial lining associated with dense inflammation
    (pannus). This inflamed vascular mass spreads over and progressively
    destroys the articular cartilage, with resulting adhesions
    and limitation of movement. In severe cases this may progress
    to fibrous ankyloses (see below). In the acute phase there
    may be pain and tenderness over the joints, which may be
    hot and swollen and therefore appear infected. There may
    be a deep-seated, aching pain, particularly on moving the
    jaws. In advanced cases, limitation of movement develops.
    In the acute phase, an acute infection must be excluded as
    this is severe and potentially life-threatening; however,
    it is rare.</p>
<p>Arthritis in children (juvenile arthritis), if severe, can damage
    the condyle’s growth potential which can result in facial
    asymmetry, micrognathia (undersized jaw) and malocclusion.</p>
<h1 id="infective-arthritis">Infective arthritis</h1>
<p>With the advent of antibiotics, infective arthritis has become
    rare. Most cases arose from the spread of infection from
    the ear (otitis externa, otitis media) which is nowadays
    much better diagnosed and treated. However, infective arthritis
    is a potentially very severe condition because it may spread
    into the middle cranial fossa and result in intracranial
    sepsis.</p>
<p>Symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pyrexia and systemic upset</li>
    <li>throbbing pain</li>
    <li>swelling</li>
    <li>erythema</li>
    <li>suppuration</li>
    <li>very restricted mouth opening</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ankylosis">Ankylosis</h1>
<p>Ankylosis is an abnormal union across a joint space. This may
    be either fibrous or bony in origin. Commonly, ankylosis
    is seen in the larger joints (for instance the hips and knees
    following severe injuries, or the spine in ankylosing spondylitis).</p>
<p>Normal mouth opening is said to be greater than 40mm in adults.
    In addition, it should be possible to protrude the mandible
    at least 7mm and move it side to side a similar amount. Untreated
    ankylosis results in permanent limitation of the mouth opening
    and may restrict development of the midface if it occurs
    in the very young. Bony ankylosis results in the most severe
    limitation of opening. Ankylosis may be considered as extracapsular
    or (‘false’ ankylosis) or intracapsular (‘true’ ankylosis).</p>
<h2>Causes of extracapsular ankylosis</h2>
<ol>
    <li>trauma resulting in periarticular fibrosis (e.g. lacerations,
        burns, dislocation)</li>
    <li>chronic or untreated infection next to the joint</li>
    <li>tumours (for example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma</a>)</li>
    <li>periarticular fibrosis (irradiation, prolonged immobilisation
        of the jaws)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Causes of intracapsular ankylosis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>trauma (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">intracapsular condylar fracture</a>,
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">penetrating wounds</a>,
        forceps delivery at birth)</li>
    <li>infection (otitis media, mastoiditis, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">osteomyelitis</a>,
        pyogenic arthritis)</li>
    <li>systemic disease (juvenile arthritis, psoriasis, rheumatoid
        arthritis, osteoarthritis)</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">tumours</a> (chondroma,
        osteochondroma, osteoma, sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, synovial
        sarcoma)</li>
    <li>miscellaneous (synovial chondromatosis (development of surplus
        cartilage in the joint))</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pseudoankylosis</h2>
<p>This condition is a mechanical interference with mouth opening
    which does not directly involve the joint itself. Causes
    include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>trauma (e.g. depression of the zygomatic arch impinging on
        the coronoid or insertion of temporalis muscle)</li>
    <li>myositis ossificans (muscle turning into bone tissue) within
        any of the muscles of mastication</li>
</ul>
