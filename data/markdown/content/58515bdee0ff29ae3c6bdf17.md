<p>The most commonly performed procedures in purely
    aesthetic facial surgery</p>
<ul>
    <li>rhytidectomy (face lift, of which there are many
        different varieties);</li>
    <li>blepharoplasty (addressing puffy or sagging upper
        and/or lower eye lids, related: brow lift);</li>
    <li>otoplasty (improving the appearance of prominent
        ears (‘bat ears’));</li>
    <li>rhinoplasty (a range of corrections to the nose);
    </li>
    <li>genioplasty (movement or reshaping of the chin)</li>
</ul>
<p>follow a number of strategies in order to achieve a
    rejuvenated, or otherwise, improved facial appearance.
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, rhytidectomy, upper lid blepharoplasty
    and brow lifts rely on the removal of excess skin. Lower
    lid blepharoplasty deals with a remodelling of the fat
    pads under the eyes.</p>
<p>Various otoplasty, rhinoplasty and genioplasty procedures
    generally rely on remodelling of different tissues. This
    includes re-sculpting of hard tissue (bones) and
    modifications applied to connective (cartilage) and soft
    tissues.</p>
<p>An important issue about facial aesthetic surgery is that
    the techniques can be used with other approaches in
    treating disease as well as what will always be a
    subjective indication for surgery; aesthetics.</p>
<p>There will always be an air of controversy over the use
    of invasive (and minimally invasive) surgical techniques
    in the area of aesthetics, we do not judge this but
    simply aim to provide factual accurate information where
    possible.</p>
