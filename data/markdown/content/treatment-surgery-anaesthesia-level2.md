<p>Maxillofacial surgery presents some specific issues for anaesthesia;
    below we briefly describe these.</p>
<h1 id="anaesthetic-issues-specific-to-maxillofacial-surgery">Anaesthetic issues specific to maxillofacial surgery</h1>
<h2>Shared airway</h2>
<p>Safe anaesthesia relies on an unobstructed airway to maintain
    gaseous exchange. This can be provided by the use of an endotracheal
    tube passed through the mouth or the nose into the trachea
    (windpipe). Alternatively, when isolation of the trachea
    is not essential, devices that lie on top of the larynx known
    as laryngeal masks (breathing masks) or ‘supraglottic airways’
    may be used.</p>
<p>Intraoral surgery has the potential for disturbing the unobstructed
    airway. Similarly, anaesthetic airways placed in the mouth
    reduce surgical access and may be unsuitable. The needs of
    both the anaesthetist and the surgeon need to be balanced
    safely.</p>
<p>In many circumstances the use of a nasal tracheal tube provides
    the safest airway for intraoral procedures.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for endotracheal tubes and supraglottic airways
    to become dislodged or obstructed during head and neck procedures.
    Anaesthetists must be constantly vigilant to protect the
    shared airway. Communication between anaesthetist and surgeon
    is essential for patient safety.</p>
<h2>Patient comorbidities</h2>
<p>Patients presenting for maxillofacial surgery are extremely varied.
    All age groups are represented and the very young and the
    very old present aditional challenges.</p>
<p>Anaesthetists grade patients using the 6 point ASA (American
    Society of Anaesthesiologists) score (see Table 1) which
    correlates comorbidities to mortality risk. Patients with
    high ASA scores might be declined surgery.</p>
<h2>Table 1 The ASA score for patient assessment</h2>
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th> ASA classification</th>
            <th> Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 1</td>
            <td> A normal, healthy patient</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 2</td>
            <td> A patient with mild systemic disease</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 3</td>
            <td> A patient with severe systemic disease</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 4</td>
            <td> A patient with severe systemic disease that is a
                constant threat to life</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 5</td>
            <td> A moribund patient who is not expected to survive
                with the operation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 6</td>
            <td> A declared brain-dead patient whose organs are being
                removed for donation</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<p>Oncology patients often have multiple comorbidities such as respiratory
    disease and coronary artery disease. This confers additional
    perioperative (during the operation) risks. Patients must
    be investigated prior to surgery and plans made for postoperative
    care.</p>
<h2>Difficult Intubation</h2>
<p>Difficulty with intubation and ventilation may be predicted but
    can occur unexpectedly. Patients posing problems with intubation
    include those with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>    (difficulty with opening the mouth, intraoral masses, previous
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>.</p>
<p>Difficult intubations may be predicted by examining the patient’s
    airway. The Mallampatti score (see Figure 1) assesses the
    ability to visualise anatomical structures through the mouth.
    The higher the score the more difficult are intubation and
    ventilation likely to be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Class I: the soft palate is completely visible</li>
    <li>Class II: the uvula is completely visible</li>
    <li>Class III: only the base of the uvula is visible</li>
    <li>Class IV: the soft palate if not visible at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many strategies to deal with intubation problems. Anaesthetists
    in the United Kingdom follow the <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">Difficult Airway Society Guidelines</a>.
    The final step in the guidelines is emergency surgical access
    through the cricothyroid membrane (elastic tissue in front
    of the thyroid).</p>
<h2>Postoperative care</h2>
<p>Careful consideration should be given by both surgeon and anaesthetist
    about the care of the maxillofacial patient following the
    procedure.</p>
<p>Some patients may go home the same day, others will require inpatient
    facilities. If the airway is at risk of obstruction (for
    example, by postoperative swelling), high dependency or intensive
    care is necessary. If airway obstruction is highly likely,
    it is prudent to place a temporary tracheostomy (surgical
    opening through the neck into the trachea (windpipe)). Temporary
    tracheostomies are used until intraoral swelling has subsided
    – often 4 to 6 days. Safe decannulation may be considered
    when a leak occurs around a tube when the cuff is deflated.</p>
<p>Patients with potential for airway obstruction must be nursed
    by speciality trained staff in appropriately equipped wards.</p>
