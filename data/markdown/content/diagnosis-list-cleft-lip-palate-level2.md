<h1 id="cleft-lip-and-palate">Cleft lip and palate</h1>
<p>Clefts of the lip and palate are the most common craniofacial
    malformations, and comprise 65 % of all anomalies affecting
    the head and neck. There are two useful distinct types of
    cleft anomaly, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and
    isolated cleft palate. There is a difference in the pathogenesis
    of the two.</p>
<h2>Aetiology</h2>
<p>The aetiology of clefting is multi-factorial. Some environmental
    factors such as phenytoin (an anti-epileptic drug) taken
    in pregnancy increase the risk of cleft lip and palate, other
    drugs such as retinoids (used to treat a range of skin conditions),
    folate deficiency (increased need during pregnancy) or the
    foetal alcohol syndrome also increase the incidence. Maternal
    obesity increases the risk. Folic acid supplementation has
    been shown to reduce the incidence.</p>
<p>The term for this overall failure of normal development is that
    the formation of cleft lip and palate exhibits polygenic
    inheritance with a threshold.</p>
<h2>Defects caused by the clefting process</h2>
<p>The disruption of the muscular sphincter of the mouth (<i>orbicularis oris</i>)
    may be partial, as in an incomplete cleft of the lip (see
    Figure 1), or total as in a complete unilateral cleft of
    the lip (see Figure 2).  </p>

</figure>
<p>This has a direct effect on the associated deformity. Patients
    with incomplete cleft lips often seem to have relatively
    normal alar bases and intra alar widths (wings and width
    of the nose). Patients with complete clefts will have a significant
    lateral and posterior migration of the alar base on the cleft
    side. A bulge around the region of the alar base will be
    seen where the abnormal insertion of the orbicularis oris
    muscles are and a bulge lateral to the alar base where the
    external nasal muscles are attached is seen. In complete
    clefts there will often be a defect in the alveolus (socket
    in the jaw bone to hold teeth) which may range from a slight
    notch to a complete cleft of the alveolus extending into
    the palate. In complete clefts of the lip, the nasal septum
    and collumella (skin and cartilage separating the nostrils)
    are pulled to the side opposite the cleft by the contralateral
    normally attached musculature. This leads to a deviation
    of the tip of the nose and contributes to the classical appearance.</p>
<p>Patients with bilateral clefts may exhibit more apparent symmetry
    in both incomplete (see Figure 3) and complete cases (see
    Fig 4) but the main problem is that the premaxilla (bones
    at the tip of the upper jaw) will rotate forward as it contains
    no muscle and the <i>orbicularis oris</i> muscle exerts no
    restraints on the forward growth of the premaxilla.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Complete bilateral cleft lip and
        palate showing unrestrained premaxillary growth..</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In clefts of the alveolus whether bilateral or unilateral, the
    defect in the alveolus may be either simple notching or notching
    associated with congenital absence of the lateral incisor
    (second front tooth) or presence of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">supernumeraries</a>    (extra teeth), or a rudimentary lateral incisor, or a complete
    oro-nasal <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistula</a> with
    a range of associated dental abnormalities.</p>
<p>If the defect extends between the lip and the palate, any combination
    of complete or incomplete, bilateral or unilateral clefts
    of the lip and alveolus may be associated with the cleft
    extending through the hard and soft palate. In unilateral
    cases, rotation and collapse of the segments of the maxilla
    (upper jaw) in an inward and anterior (forward) direction
    is usually seen. This is more marked on the side of the cleft.
    This part of the cleft maxilla is referred to as the lesser
    segment. In bilateral clefts, both the lateral segments are
    collapsed behind the prominent premaxilla.</p>
<p>Isolated clefts of the palate may affect the soft palate or the
    hard palate, or a combination of both, or the uvula (soft
    tissue structure at the back of the soft palate) in isolation.
    There is also a condition known as submucous clefting where
    the oral mucosa (lining) of the palate, and often the oral
    and nasal mucosa of the palate are intact, but there is no
    underlying bone or muscle. This condition can be easily missed
    and may only become obvious once the child has had its adenoids
    (tonsils) removed and develops marked hyponasality in speech.
    The usual finding is a widening of the dental arch posterioraly
    (to the back), associated with the cleft and significant
    eustachian tube (structure connecting the middle ear to the
    part of the throat behind the nose) dysfunction which frequently
    results in otitis media (glue ear) and hearing impairment.</p>
<p>The common marks of cleft lip and palate include problems with
    feeding due to a communication between the mouth and the
    nasal cavity, decreasing the baby’s ability to suck. This
    can be overcome by positional feeding and the use of appropriate
    bottles to deliver feed.</p>
<h3>Problems with hearing</h3>
<p>Eustachian tube dysfunction as a result of cleft palate inhibits
    adequate ventilation of the middle ear and this causes secretory
    otitis media (glue ear) and can result in deafness. This
    contributes to a child’s difficulty in learning speech as
    hearing oneself talk is part of the natural bio-feedback
    of learning to communicate.</p>
<h3>Direct speech problems</h3>
<p>Learning to speak with lip or alveolar defects, defects in the
    hard and soft palate, and in later life dental anomalies
    have an obvious impact and require early assessment and,
    if necessary, intervention by <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapists</a>.</p>
<p>The anatomical problems related to the nose can result in a poor
    nasal airway with resulting speech, breathing and sinus related
    problems.</p>
<h2>Principles of management</h2>
<p>In many centres, neonatal detection by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound scans</a>    is possible as the shape of the face is detectable by the
    14<sup>th</sup> week <i>in utero</i> and the parents may
    well be advised that their child will have a cleft. This
    may help to come to terms with the shock of having a child
    with a cleft. It is however common for parents to experience
    feelings of guilt and regret, and often requires time to
    effectively grieve for the loss of the anticipated ‘normal’
    child. It is sometimes helpful to take photographs of the
    child with the cleft as this child effectively vanishes once
    the initial cleft repair has been carried out.</p>
<p>At the point of diagnosis, home support by a specialist health
    visitor to assist with bonding between parents and child
    and help with feeding can be useful. Directed flow of milk
    into the mouth using soft bottles and positioning the child
    will allow the child to be adequately nourished. A range
    of useful bottles and teats are available and can be obtained
    in the UK from the Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA),
    a cleft support group.</p>
<p>Most centres in the UK have limited active intervention at this
    early time although world-wide a variety of pre-surgical
    orthopaedic techniques have been advocated at this point.
    Although practice varies throughout the world these are not
    currently in vogue in the UK.</p>
<h3>Timing of surgery</h3>
<p>The precise details of the timing of surgery will vary depending
    on the individual. A commonly used protocol includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>lip +/- alveolus +/- soft palate repair at three to six months
        old;</li>
    <li>repair of residual palatal defect at nine to twelve months
        old;</li>
    <li>audiology (hearing assessment) +/- myringotomy Intervention
        to release pressure on middle ear) either at this time
        or as indicated by audiological assessment;</li>
    <li>formal speech assessment around two-years old;</li>
    <li>pharyngeal (throat) surgery if indicated by <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapy assessment</a>        at four to five-years old;</li>
    <li>alveolar bone grafting assessment at age eight years, followed
        by actual <a href="/treatment/surgery/cleft-lip-palate">alveolar bone grafting</a>        between the ages of nine and eleven;</li>
    <li>definitive <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">orthodontics</a>        (treatment of irregularities of teeth) +/- <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic surgery</a>        (corrective jaw surgery) between the ages of 15 and 18
        years old;</li>
    <li>definitive <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">rhinoplasty</a>        (corrective nose surgery) plus definitive <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative dentistry</a>        age 18 years plus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Primary dentition and speech assessment</h3>
<p>The development of the primary dentition should be allowed to
    progress essentially naturally with good paediatric dentistry
    in order to maintain space. No orthodontic intervention in
    the primary dentition is warranted, good preventive dentistry
    is. A joint ENT (ear, nose &amp; throat) and speech therapy
    assessment should be carried out to detect middle ear effusions
    and appropriate development of speech patterns. Hypernasal
    speech and/or glue ear should be addressed, either by therapy
    or <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">surgery</a>    such as pharyngoplasty or myringotomy (for glue ear).</p>
<h3>Mixed dentition</h3>
<p>At this stage the growth retarding effects of initial surgery
    become more evident, this is predominately side to side in
    the top jaw, and then front to back as growth in this dimension
    predominates with age. The eruption of the permanent incisors
    demonstrates defects in enamel formation and position, and
    the upper incisors may erupt into <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-disproportion">lingual occlusion</a>.
    Orthodontic preparation for alveolar bone grafting can usefully
    be combined with limited alignment of the incisors in the
    mixed dentition.</p>
<h3>Alveolar bone grafting</h3>
<p>This technique provides bone through which a permanent canine
    and lateral incisor can erupt into the arch which unifies
    the maxilla, providing a stable intact arch, improve the
    alar base support, closes the residual oro-nasal fistula
    and provides a palatal base for later orthognathic surgery.</p>
<h3>Permanent dentition</h3>
<p>The establishment of the permanent dentition including guiding
    of the canines, which have to be exposed in about 15 % of
    cases, will basically be a decision as to whether or not
    orthodontic camouflage or orthognathic surgery is indicated.</p>
<h3>Rhinoplasty</h3>
<p>Rhinoplasty should be performed at the end of treatment rather
    than as an intermediary as the final position of the nose
    can only be predicted once the maxilla is in a stable position.</p>
<h3>Definitive restorative dentistry</h3>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">Implant-borne</a> permanent
    prosthesis, or fixed-bridge prosthesis which can allow optimal
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a> should allow
    full and final rehabilitation of cleft patients.</p>
