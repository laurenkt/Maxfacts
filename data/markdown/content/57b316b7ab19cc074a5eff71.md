<p>We are acutely aware that we are much in danger of being accused
    of being preachy when we include a section about oral hygiene
    on our website. However, the fact is: keeping good oral hygiene
    is eminently important for overall health and well-being,
    far beyond the obvious benefits of preventing <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a>    and/or <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>.
    This is true ‘in sickness and in health’ and maintaining
    the best possible oral hygiene regime is definitely an area
    where you can take control and help yourself.</p>
<p>There are many, often less well known aspects, to the topic of
    oral hygiene. For example, we explain in fair detail the
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">role of saliva</a>    in keeping teeth and soft tissue of the mouth healthy. Indirectly,
    of course, this also illustrates the importance of strict
    oral hygiene when you suffer from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>.</p>
<p>We demonstrate good brushing and cleaning techniques in <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">videos</a>    and a <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/practical-guide">written practical guide</a>    gives more detailed information. We include information about
    everyday routines as well as comments about more difficult
    situations such as after major oral or maxillofacial <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy to the head and neck region</a>,
    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">difficulties with opening the mouth</a>.</p>
