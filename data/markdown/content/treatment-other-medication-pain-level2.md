<p>To understand better <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">how pain can be managed</a>,
    it is helpful to understand the mechanisms and processing
    of pain signals and sensations within the body. This is regulated
    by the nervous system, with the pain signal being carried
    by nerve cells called neurons to the body’s signal processing
    centres, generally referred to as the central nervous system
    (the spinal cord and the brain).</p>
<p>There are two different types of pain, both following different
    mechanisms of pain sensation. Acute pain follows a well understood
    mechanism and can be predicted and managed with relative
    ease. The mechanisms of chronic pain are less well understood
    and so chronic pain can be more difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Below we provide a brief view of the important parts, steps and
    mechanisms in pain signalling. We think that this is important
    for understanding how pain is managed (for example, in
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local or general anaesthesia</a>), where these mechanisms
        can go wrong and, for example, may result in chronic
        pain, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">neuropathies</a>,
        or a range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">facial pain syndromes</a>.</p>
<h1 id="mechanics-neurons-and-general-principles">Mechanics, neurons and general principles</h1>
<p>Pain signals follow a general mechanistic pathway through the
    body from the source to the processing centres (Figure 1).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Schematic flow of a pain signal
        from detection of the stimulus to processing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When a stimulus is applied, specialised nerve cells (neurons)
    in the peripheral nervous system detect the signal and propagate
    it through the spinal cord to the brain. The spinal cord
    and brain process the information as part of the functions
    of the central nervous system, causing the actual pain sensation.</p>
<p>Neurons are found throughout the body. Their structures are well
    adapted to detect stimuli and transfer the resulting signal
    through the body (Figure 2).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> General structural features of
        a neuron.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Nociceptors are specialised sensory detectors on free nerve endings,
    dendrites, which detect noxious (unpleasant) stimuli. These
    stimuli are converted to electrical signals by the nociceptors.
    The (minor) energy input from the stimulus alters the membrane
    permeability, allowing small ions, such as Na<sup>+</sup>    ions, to permeate the membrane more easily. This produces
    a tiny depolarisation on the interior of the dendrite, which
    is the primary electrical event. The electrical signals are
    then passed down the axon to the axon terminus, and on to
    the next neuron unit</p>
<p>Neurons are classed as excitable cells. All excitable cells have
    a negative voltage inside the cell compared to the voltage
    outside the cell (Figure 3). This voltage is established
    by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>potassium ions, K<sup>+</sup>, moving out of the cell through
        the cell membrane <i>via</i> non-gated (not controlled
        and happening all the time) K<sup>+</sup> ion channels
        along a K<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient;</li>
    <li>sodium ions, Na<sup>+</sup>, being present outside the cell
        but not being able to move in through the membrane as
        its gated (controlled) transport channels are closed.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Membrane channels under normal
        cell conditions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the body, the different ions tend to be spread out evenly.
    As a consequence, ions will move from an area of high concentration
    to low concentration, along the concentration gradient, without
    any stimulus being required. This is similar to the increasingly
    even distribution over time of sugar in a hot drink, even
    if the brew is not stirred. Initially, there will be a higher
    sugar concentration where it was added, over time the dissolved
    sugar molecules will spread throughout the liquid and eventually
    will be evenly distributed. The same principles of dissolution
    of electrolytes applies in the body (which for this aspect
    may be seen as behaving like a liquid; not an unreasonable
    view given that a body consists of approximately 80 percent
    water). Gradients are used in the ion channels passing through
    cell membranes where ions move from a high concentration
    to a low concentration area without stimulus.</p>
<p>With K<sup>+</sup> ions moving out of the cell constantly through
    non-gated K<sup>+</sup> ion channels and no positive ions
    moving in under normal conditions, overall this leaves the
    inside of the cell with a lack of positive ions compared
    to the outside of the cell. There are also voltage-gated
    K<sup>+</sup> ion channels in the cell, which can be used
    to move K<sup>+</sup> ions faster out of the cell; the voltage
    (charge) of the cell controls these gated channels.</p>
<p>The voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels work in a similar
    way to the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and are also
    controlled by the voltage of the cell. They contain a voltage-sensing
    region that is positive and is attracted to the negative
    region either inside or outside the cell. In normal conditions,
    it is attracted to the negative inside of the cell and sits
    towards the inside of the cell causing the channel to be
    closed (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Conformational change of the voltage-gated
        Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels that allows Na<sup>+</sup>        ions into the cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Neurons harness these gradients of ions when it comes to propagating
    a signal along its length. When a signal is detected by the
    nociceptors of the neuron, the neuron undergoes a small depolarisation.
    Over this depolarisation, the inside of the cell becomes
    more positively charged than the outside of the cell, the
    opposite of how it was before. As this depolarisation makes
    the outside of the cell more negative, the voltage-sensing
    regions in the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels
    move towards the outside of the cell. This causes a conformational
    change in the channel, opening it and allowing Na<sup>+</sup>    ions to move into the cell through the channel. This movement
    makes the inside of the cell more positive, increasing the
    depolarisation and passing it along to the next section of
    the axon where there are more closed voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>    ion channels. These channels react in the same way to the
    depolarisation and the signal is thus passed along the axon
    (Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Movement of a signal along an
        axon by the opening of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> ion
        channels due to depolarisation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels have a segment
    called the channel-inactivating segment, which, once the
    channel has been opened, moves into the open channel to inactivate
    it and stop more / too many Na<sup>+</sup> ions entering
    the cell (Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Inactivation of the voltage-gated
        Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The inactivating segment remains in place while that part of
    the membrane is still depolarised, stopping more signals
    being sent through that part of the neuron. This allows distinction
    of different signals, and attenuation of each signal to give
    the correct level of response for the stimulus. The duration
    of signal transmission is the same, only the number of signals
    changes to indicate the level of pain.</p>
<p>The cell voltage must be reset, back to normal after the depolarisation.
    This is achieved through the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup>    ion channels, which open when the inside of the cell is positively
    charged, allowing more K<sup>+</sup> ions to be removed from
    the cell. This removes the excess of positive charge from
    the inside of the cell, restoring the normal voltage of the
    cell.</p>
<p>An unmyelinated neuron (see Figure 2) propagates the signal in
    the way described above, with a signal passing through an
    axon at speeds of up to 1 m/s. Unmyelinated neurons are typically
    C fibres (see Table 1) and are generally responsible for
    the detection of temperature changes, such as noxious heat
    or cold. Complex movements, such as those needed to run,
    require much faster signal propagation. This is achieved
    through myelination of the neurons. Myelination is the partial
    covering of the length of the neuron with a lipid (a fatty
    acid) called myelin. There are gaps in the myelination called
    the nodes of Ranvier where no myelin is present and where
    the transmitted signal can ‘jump along’. The myelin sheath
    acts as insulation on the neuron and increases the rate of
    signal transmission along the neuron (Figure 7).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> General structure of a myelinated
        neuron.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The myelin sheath prevents any movement of ions in or out of
    the cell. Only in the regions not covered by myelin, the
    nodes of Ranvier, can ions move in or out of the cell. All
    of the voltage-gated channels are located in these nodes
    in such neurons. This speeds up propagation of the signal,
    as depolarisation at one node causes an excess of positive
    ions in that region. That surplus diffuses down the axon
    rapidly to the next node causing depolarisation there. This
    allows the signal to effectively jump along the axon, causing
    it to conduct the signal at speeds of 10 to 100 m/s, much
    faster than the unmyelinated neurons conduct. The nodes of
    Ranvier and the ‘jump along’ mechanism are relevant in the
    context of effective <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">local anaesthetic nerve blocks</a>    and the underlying mechanism of blocking pain signals from
    spreading at these <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">locations</a>.</p>
<p>There is a threshold the signal must surpass for it to cause
    a depolarisation in neurons and to be detected. This is required
    to make sure that small fluctuations in the voltage do not
    cause a signal for pain. The activation threshold is different
    for each fibre and is based on what they are meant to detect.
    Only a small stimulus is needed for non-noxious signals.
    These are sensations that are felt but not painful, such
    as the light touch of someone putting their hand on your
    shoulder. A large activation threshold is needed for fibres
    that detect more serious pain to ensure they are not stimulated
    by anything other than the serious pain they are meant to
    detect.</p>
<p>Afferent fibres are the nerve fibres that carry a pain/sensation-inducing
    signal towards the central nervous system. Of these afferent
    fibres, there are three main classes of fibres detecting
    stimuli:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A<i>β</i> fibres;</li>
    <li>A<i>δ</i> fibres;</li>
    <li>C fibres.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these different classes detects different types of stimuli.</p>
<p>A<i>β</i> fibres differ from the other two classes, as they are
    the only class that detects non-noxious stimuli (A<i>δ</i>    fibres and C fibres detect noxious stimuli). A<i>β</i> fibres
    respond to light touch and do not create a pain signal upon
    stimulation, so are not relevant in transmitting pain signals.
    They are included in Table 1 (below) as a comparison to the
    pain detecting fibres.</p>

<p>There are three different general classes of stimuli that cause
    a pain sensation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>mechanical;</li>
    <li>thermal;</li>
    <li>chemical.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different afferent neuron fibres respond to different stimuli,
    with A<i>δ</i> fibres responding to mechanical and thermal
    stimuli, and C fibres responding to all three classes.</p>
<p>The greater the degree of myelination of a nerve fibre, the faster
    is its speed of signal conduction; A<i>δ</i> fibres conduct
    pain signals faster than C fibres. C fibres have a larger
    activation threshold, as stimulation of these fibres causes
    more serious pain, so it needs to be ensured that C fibres
    are not stimulated by any irrelevant stimuli.</p>
<p>Once the signal reaches the end of the axon, it reaches the synapses
    to the dendrites of other neurons to pass on the signal.
    Synapses are the gaps between the neurons where the signal
    must pass through. The signal has been conducted electrically
    in the neurons, however, to cross the synapse, it becomes
    a chemical signal. The electrical signal stimulates the release
    of the chemical messenger molecules. There are vesicles in
    the axons containing these chemical messenger compounds,
    known as neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are small, water-soluble molecules (such as
    acetylcholine, L-glutamate or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/dopamine">dopamine</a>),
    which can diffuse around the body or, in this case, across
    a synapse. There are specific receptors for each neurotransmitter,
    with binding causing localised charge changes in the neighbouring
    neuron, turning the signal back to electrical and thus propagating
    the signal along the nerve fibre. The receptors are specific
    for a particular neurotransmitter (the key and lock principle
    of mutual fit). When the electrical signal reaches the end
    of the axon, the vesicles undergo exocytosis (they burst),
    releasing the neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse
    (Figure 8). The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse
    very quickly and bind to the receptors on the dendrites of
    the next neuron.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Chemical signalling in the synapse
        between two neurons to pass on the pain signal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Neurotransmitters are chemical signals in many different processes.
    While they conduct the pain signal in synapses, they can
    also disrupt or block the travel of a pain signal. For example,
    this can occur by different neurotransmitter molecules blocking
    a receptor site. This principle can be used to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">modulate pain</a>.</p>
<p>The neurons in the peripheral nervous system synapse to neurons
    in the spinal cord, passing the signal to the central nervous
    system where it is further processed (Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure9.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Overview of how the pain signal
        is detected and moves through the peripheral nervous
        system.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the neurons from the peripheral nervous system synapse to
    the neurons in the spinal cord, the signal is propagated
    up the spinal cord and to the brain’s processing centres.
    The signals commonly pass through three areas of the brain.
    First, the signal goes through the brain stem, known as the
    medulla, which connects the spinal cord to the brain. From
    here, the neuron from the medulla synapses to neurons in
    the thalamus of the brain, which is a sensory interpretation
    area of the brain, passing on the signal. Finally, the thalamus
    synapses to the somatosensory cortex of the brain, which
    are the particular regions of the brain that specialise in
    processing pain.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about these centres in the brain,
        this information is on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The pain-processing areas in the brain can interpret the incoming
    signals and cause the corresponding pain sensation to be
    felt elsewhere in the body (Figure 10).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Overview of how the pain signal
        moves through key areas of the brain.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The general pathway for pain sensation, following the route from
    peripheral nervous system, to the spinal cord and then to
    the brain, is known as the spinothalamic tract (Figure 11).
    There is another tract known as the spinoreticular tract.
    However, that tract is more involved in the emotional aspects
    of pain than the sensation itself.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure11.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Pain pathway of the spinothalamic
        tract.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The body has its own mechanisms of inhibiting pain. These can
    sometimes be involved in pain modulation. One well-known
    example is the scenario of bumping one’s head. When we bump
    our head, we feel pain, but when we rub it, it feels better.
    This is due to activation of the A<i>β</i> fibres, which
    detect the rubbing as a non-noxious stimulus. This stimulates
    inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, which have a
    blocking effect, inhibiting (some of) the pain signal from
    the C fibres by hyperpolarising the neuron that would have
    passed the pain signal to the brain (Figure 12).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level2-figure12.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> Effect of inhibitory interneurons
        in stopping pain signal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This blocking effect is due to neurotransmitters in the synapse
    between the inhibitory interneuron and the neuron in the
    spinal cord that takes information to the brain (to the somatosensory
    cortex). The inhibitory interneuron releases neurotransmitters
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/gaba">GABA</a>    and glycine, rather than the usual neurotransmitters. These
    ‘wrong’ neurotransmitters interrupt the pain signalling to
    some extent.  </p>
<p>Another way the body naturally inhibits pain is <i>via</i> descending
    pathways. These occur after stimulation of the grey matter
    in the brain and descend from the brain stem to the spinal
    cord, having an analgesic effect. This is thought to be due
    to the release of natural opioid-like substances, known as
    endogenous opioids, (which act as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesics</a>).
    Endogenous opioids, such as <i>β</i>-endorphins and enkephalins,
    bind to <i>µ</i>-opioid receptors on neurons. This binding
    supresses the pain signal as these endogenous opioids act
    as inhibitors of excitatory neurotransmitters.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the dual role of opioids
        as recreational and medicinal drugs, this is discussed
        on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/other">recreational drugs</a>        as well as on the following page about <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">pain medication</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="acute-pain">Acute pain</h1>
<p>Acute pain occurs as and when needed, when the pain-signalling
    system is functioning correctly. It is a widely accepted
    view that acute pain is designed to protect the body from
    further damage. The mechanisms described above are at work
    to create this alert system and require the correct functioning
    of all the sub-systems to work correctly. With these mechanisms
    of pain sensation being well understood for acute pain, it
    is easier to manage as certain parts of the mechanism can
    be targeted to reduce or eliminate the pain sensation felt.</p>
<p>In general, acute pain mainly acts when an injury (or other lesion)
    occurs, and gradually ramps down during the healing phase.
    During the healing phase, its main protective role is to
    prevent over-usage of an injured part of the body. This can
    be a disadvantage when it stops the use of the area for too
    long and so may hamper recovery. If the mechanisms for acute
    pain sensation malfunction in some way(s), this is one potential
    origin for chronic pain.</p>
<p>The simple concept of acute pain as a warning mechanism becomes
    quite confused when one considers acute pain examples from
    the maxillofacial region:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Toothache – 32 nerve and blood vessel complexes (in a fully
        dentate adult), completely surrounded by dense, non-expandable
        tissue. The only subjective cerebral response to stimulation
        of this complex is pain. The healing response of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>        can quickly result in terminal ischaemia (inadequate
        blood supply) of the complex, rendering it highly susceptible
        to subsequent <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>.
        It is quite difficult to see the evolutionary advantage
        to acute pain in this context.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">Oral ulceration</a>        – oddly, benign mucosal ulceration is often temporarily
        exquisitely painful, whereas the ulceration of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oral cancer</a>        is often not painful. The evolutionary advantage of acute
        pain here is almost oxymoronic.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">Fractures of the jaws</a>        – here the acute pain is functioning as it should. Displacement
        and movement of the fractured bone ends are painful.
        Restoration of correct position (known as reduction)
        and fixation to prevent movement provides good pain relief
        and the optimal healing environment.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">Trigeminal neuralgia</a>        – effectively a sensory form of epilepsy, giving rise
        to extreme acute pain of absolutely no benefit to the
        sufferer. This can have a chronic pre- or post-neuralgic
        type of pain but in its commonest form is simply acute
        pain in a pure but entirely dysfunctional form.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chronic-pain">Chronic pain</h1>
<p>Chronic pain has no protective role and it occurs when the pain-signalling
    system is malfunctioning. There are many different ways the
    system can malfunction. There is no useful function to chronic
    pain, with it simply causing pain when there should not be
    any. Because of this, chronic pain is also sometimes referred
    to as neuropathic pain and may be considered a disease in
    its own right.</p>
<p>There are three main areas where pain-signalling malfunction
    can occur:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the peripheral nervous system;</li>
    <li>the transmitting nerve fibres;</li>
    <li>the processing of pain signal in the brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Table 2 summarises some of the main categories and types of chronic
    pain. These most common examples of sub-types of chronic
    pain are given clinical names. There are some common causes
    of failure for these pain syndromes. All of these malfunctions
    can be categorised as inhibition malfunctions, where the
    system fails to stop pain signals being sent at the wrong
    time, for too long, or from the wrong place.</p>

<p>Chronic pain follows complicated and in part poorly understood
    mechanisms. Such long-term pain syndromes are hardly predictable
    and may be very hard to manage satisfactorily.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">Facial arthromyalgia</a>    is probably the commonest form of chronic facial pain syndromes
    seen clinically. This is a combination of myofascial pain
    from inappropriate stimulus of muscle causing painful spasm,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">neuropathic response</a>,
    and is often associated with affect changes suggesting changes
    in higher cognitive processing of the chronic painful stimuli.</p>
<p>Pain, in particular chronic pain, is an all-encompassing sensation.
    It can affect the whole body, making it difficult or impossible
    to go about daily life. It can also be hard to explain to
    others who have not experienced it why it has such an effect
    on life, potentially making it a very isolating experience
    as well. In particular chronic pain affects different people
    in different ways.</p>
<p>There is no objective or simple way of classifying or ‘measuring’
    pain (acute or chronic pain, for that matter). There are
    a widely used subjective systems of describing how bad the
    pain is by using numerical systems with a scale of 1 to 10
    (or similar), or other variants of a visual analogue scale,
    or a scale of smiling to crying faces for children. However,
    such attempts really cannot get around the problem that pain
    cannot be measured in such simplistic ways. The problem can
    be communicated to a certain extent with the help of language
    (including body language) and that also helps to identify
    the quality of pain sensation rather than just its intensity.</p>
