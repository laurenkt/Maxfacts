<p>Carnoy’s solution is a caustic mixture of chemicals (by volume:
    60 % ethanol, 30 % chloroform, 10 % concentrated acetic acid).
    It is named after J.P. Carnoy, a 19<sup>th</sup> century
    Belgian cytologist who developed the mixture as a fixative
    for tissue samples. In some preparations a small amount of
    ferric chloride, FeCl<sub>3</sub>, is added to the mixture.
    More recently an alternative formulation of Carnoy’s solution,
    omitting chloroform (by volume: 75 % ethanol, 25 % concentrated
    acetic acid) has been used in medical applications (see below).
    Chloroform is suspected to be a potentially carcinogenic
    substance for humans and, therefore is considered as problematic
    in applications on humans.</p>
<p>Tissue fixation in the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histology / pathology laboratory</a>    for a fair range of tissue types and purposes remains the
    main application of Carnoy’s solution.</p>
<p>In addition, the chemical properties of Carnoy’s solution make
    it a chemical agent for cauterization (‘chemical curettage’)
    of living tissues. In this capacity Carnoy’s solution is
    used as an additional topical treatment after <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">surgical enucleation of bone cysts</a>,
    in particular in the treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">keratocysts / keratocystic tumours</a>    of the jaws and some other benign tumours of the jaws (
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">ameloblastoma</a>). The epithelial lining of keratocysts
        is difficult to remove completely and recurrence is therefore
        a common problem. Treating the surgical bed after enucleation
        with Carnoy’s solution appears to decrease recurrence
        rates compared with enucleation alone.</p>
<p>Application of Carnoy’s solution is thought to eliminate any
    remaining epithelial lining of a cyst and/or local microcycsts;
    the solution causes superficial local <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrosis</a>.
    In this way, it appears that enucleation combined with chemical
    cauterization can achieve recurrence rates similar to those
    of more radical surgical resection, with reduced morbidity.
    It is currently unclear if the ‘modified’ version of Carnoy’s
    solution without chloroform is as effective as the original
    composition.</p>
