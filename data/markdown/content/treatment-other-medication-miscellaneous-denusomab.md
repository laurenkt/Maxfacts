<p>Denusomab belongs to a class of drugs called <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive agents</a>.
    These agents interfere with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">regular bone remodelling</a>    by hindering the bone resorption step in this process. Denusomab
    inhibits the activation of the osteoclasts (the cells driving
    the resorption part of the bone renewal process). Denusomab
    is used in the treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastatic bone disease</a>,
    other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone malignancies</a>,
    such as multiple myeloma, hypercalcaemia (too high a concentration
    of calcium ions, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in plasma) secondary to
    a malignancy, and severe osteoporosis.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the regular bone remodelling
        processes and how these are disturbed by <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        or a range of medications, this is discussed on our
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">detailed page about bone necrosis</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Denusomab is relevant in a maxillofacial context because of its
    adverse effects. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">Antiresorptive agents</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>    as well denusomab are nowadays the most common cause of medication-related
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">osteonecrosis of the jaws</a>,
    a debilitating condition often in need of surgical intervention,
    including major <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>.</p>
<p>Denusomab is a monoclonal antibody (a protein with a strong affinity
    to a specific receptor), designed such that it outcompetes
    the signalling protein (RANKL) that initiates the bone resorption
    stage of bone renewal. Denusomab has a high affinity for
    the target receptor, RANK, of RANKL. By preventing the RANKL/RANK
    interaction, denusomab inhibits the formation of osteoclasts
    (the cells responsible for bone resorption) from their precursor
    cells as well as inhibiting the survival of mature osteoclasts.
    This leads to overall reduced bone resorption. The mechanism
    of action of denusomab as an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive agent</a>    differs from that of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>.</p>
<p>Clinical studies have shown similarities and differences between
    denusomab and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">(third generation) bisphosphonates</a>    . Denusomab appears to lead to a more profound inhibition
    of bone remodelling, probably because of a more even distribution
    across all skeletal sites. This may explain the higher gain
    of bone mass density after one year of treatment with denusomab.
    When treatment is discontinued, the effects of denusomab
    are more rapidly reversed (within a few months) than for
    bisphosphonates (where persistence of more than 10 years
    has been observed). The concept of ‘drug holidays’ for denusomab
    to reduce the risk of developing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteonecrosis</a>    after invasive dental treatment (dentoalveolar procedures),
    is potentially useful but is not a realistic option for bisphosphonate
    treatment schemes. ‘Drug holidays’ for denusomab have to
    be carefully managed as overcompensating / rebound effects
    (including pathological fractures) have been observed after
    termination of denusomab treatment.</p>
<p>Despite these clinical differences and different biochemical
    mechanisms of action, the association of denusomab and bisphosphonates
    with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">necrosis of the jaw bones</a>    is very similar, if not identical. This finding strongly
    indicates that overall the inhibition of osteoclasts is a
    crucial component in the pathology of osteonecrosis: other
    medicinal agents (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/calcitonin">calcitonin</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/steroids">oestrogen</a>)
    that also reduce bone resorption rates, albeit by different
    mechanisms, have no such association with osteonecrosis of
    the jaws.</p>
