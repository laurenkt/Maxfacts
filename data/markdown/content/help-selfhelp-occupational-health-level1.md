<p>It is such good news that more and more people survive
    major head trauma, or head &amp; neck malignancies and
    other serious maxillofacial conditions, and after a
    recovery period are able to take back control over their
    life, albeit in many cases in a ‘new normal’ mode of
    operation. The burden of consequences of disease, injury
    and/or treatment can be considerable and is highly
    individual, so support with finding individual and
    practical ways to deal with, and work around, lasting
    dysfunctions is vital in the process of returning to
    normality. This is even more important given that more
    people after such serious episodes want to, and do
    return to work.</p>
<p>Many maxillofacial patients in this group have very
    specific difficulties and needs for support to manage
    everyday life. It seems difficult to find specialised
    occupational health support to meet these needs. We have
    tried to find established and easily accessible sources
    and centres of specialised support and have failed. In
    fact, it seems that in many cases patients and carers
    are the experts who can educate the professionals. We
    believe that there are occupational health experts out
    there, somewhere, who specialise in maxillofacial
    conditions but we have not found them. We speculate that
    some larger centres engaged in major maxillofacial and
    head &amp; neck surgery and aftercare may have working
    contacts with specialised occupational health experts.
    Alternatively, professional bodies such as the <a href="//rcot.co.uk">Royal College of Occupational
        Therapists</a> in the UK may be able to help and
    give advice.</p>
<p>Below we report briefly from experience and signpost
    other areas of the website, sharing some tips &amp;
    tricks and ideas that may we worth exploring (keeping in
    mind that different people will have different needs).
    Some, probably most, practical solutions and
    work-arounds will apply to home and the work place, but
    depending on somebody’s profession there may be
    additional specific practicalities to consider at the
    work place.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A common set of problems, and typically of the
        highest priority as reported by patients, are
        difficulties with <strong>oral food intake</strong>
        (or <a href="/help/non-oral-food">non-oral
            feeding</a>) and with <strong>speech</strong>.
    </li>
</ul>
<aside>
    <p>Our <a href="/help/oral-food">extensive pages about
            oral food intake</a> include many practical
        tips, in addition to background information and a
        large and ever increasing collection of recipes.</p>
</aside>
<aside>
    <p>Our pages about <a href="/help/non-oral-food">non-oral food
            intake</a> cover many aspects of short- and
        long-term enteral (tube) feeding.</p>
</aside>
<aside>
    <p>Our pages about <a href="/help/salt">speech and
            language therapy</a> cover many aspects of
        swallowing and speech rehabilitation.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Mobility and strengths</strong> of various
        affected body regions can usually be much improved
        by <a href="/help/physiotherapy">physiotherapy</a>
        and specific exercises, when combined with a degree
        of perseverance and patience.</li>
    <li>Some people are concerned about their facial scars
        and <strong>appearance</strong> when going out or to
        work. If that is a concern, using camouflage make-up
        can help. Learning how to use it and how to perfect
        its application also has some beneficial effects in
        becoming less concerned about ‘appearances’ as one
        literally pastes over the issue and can watch it
        being made invisible, not hiding from it. The
        individually best strategies to deal with
        ‘appearances’ cover a whole spectrum, from said
        camouflage make-up all the way to actually
        highlighting a problem area. An anecdote may
        illustrate this. Like most people after major
        surgery and radiotherapy treatment to the head &amp;
        neck region, a middle-aged lady found herself with
        dry mouth and lips and the need to keep mouth and
        lips moist. Apparently following some initial
        impulse, an impressive collection of lipsticks
        quickly built up, including some bold colours (she
        convincingly explained that previously she would
        have never worn some very bright pink lipstick). But
        she also observed that her affirmative, almost
        aggressive ways to ‘wear’ her disfigurement and
        problems appeared to have helped others not to look
        the other way and being less afraid of talking with
        her, after some initial confusion. Spare a thought
        for men who are concerned about appearances and
        disfigurement: it is much easier for women to deal
        with such concerns, as that is socially accepted /
        expected behaviour but much harder for men! Common
        sense and creative ways is what is needed – and
        absolutely nothing should knock down confidence or
        the drive to deal with the issue, in whichever way
        works best.</li>
    <li>On a slightly more technical note, and equally a
        source of frustration at home and at work are
        telephones. <strong>Telephone conversations</strong>
        are notoriously difficult, especially using some
        mobile phones with poor quality microphones. This
        makes speech with characteristic distortions after
        some major maxillofacial surgery difficult to
        understand. Somebody who can have a face-to-face
        conversation in a quiet environment without too many
        problems may find themselves unable to talk over the
        phone and make themselves understood. Sometimes a
        good quality landline phone may be all that is
        needed. However, for most struggling with telephone
        conversations this will remain a problem, a
        particularly frustrating problem when somebody wants
        to stay in touch and would normally use the
        telephone to make contact. We do not know of any
        convincing technical work-around for resolving the
        incomprehensible speech issue on the phone, other
        than considering a switch to text messaging or
        email, or similar non-speech platforms (and in the
        process learning to touch-type at the speed of
        light) for communication in remote. Perhaps a video
        phone-call <i>via</i> some computer platform /
        software is a practical compromise (even if
        microphones on standard computer hardware are even
        worse than those on mobile phones) because in this
        way the conversation can be enhanced by body
        language: the reason why for communication
        face-to-face there tend to be fewer problems, is
        mainly because body language is an additional
        helpful communication feature. For speech
        difficulties in face-to-face conversations, most
        people give it a try, opt for pragmatic solutions
        and if the conversation gets stuck, resort to pen
        and paper, or an electronic equivalent (a small note
        pad may be a useful gadget as it allows handwriting
        and drawing on the screen) to resolve the
        communication gap. Some people carry ready-made
        little notes as back-up. Conversation partners can
        make a very good – or a very bad contribution: if it
        is difficult to understand what somebody is saying,
        please DO NOT say ‘yes, yes’ to gloss over the
        situation. Maxillofacial patients are very good at
        sensing when the conversation gets stuck and the
        ‘yes, yes’ approach is deeply frustrating for
        somebody who tries hard to make themselves
        understood. Please DO persevere and keep on asking
        until the conversation is unstuck and all messages
        in both directions are fully exchanged, it is the
        best help one can give to somebody who is working
        hard on making their spoken communication work. A
        good way to get a conversation back on track, is to
        ask questions that can be answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’
        to find out how &amp; where the communication got
        stuck. In this way it is usually possible to get the
        conversation unstuck – and not have wasted too much
        talking efforts that are then much better spent on
        the re-started conversation.</li>
    <li><strong>At the work place</strong>, some larger
        employers may have an in-house occupational health
        support team. It is a little bit of a hit &amp; miss
        situation if such an in-house support team will be
        able to offer competent support for the specific
        needs of maxillofacial patients (such teams are
        typically more used to dealing with the most common
        office worker problems such as back pain, stiff neck
        or other consequences of non-ergonomically sound
        desk and computer arrangements in the office). It is
        worth a try to engage with such a support team, but
        maxillofacial patients will have to be prepared to
        explain all of their difficulties in detail, and
        hope that in this way the occupational health team
        will be able and willing to make helpful
        recommendations about workplace adjustments to the
        employer. For example, it seems to be difficult to
        understand that for some talking is hard work and a
        role adjustment with less need for that makes a huge
        difference. Or, installing an air humidifier at the
        work place can make a big difference, as dry air is
        problematic for many. Individually flexible office /
        work hours can have a major impact on somebody’s
        work life. A flexible and individual work schedule
        is a very good mechanism to manage difficult (and
        slow) eating circumstances, be it oral or non-oral
        food-intake. For some people, travel on business is
        a welcome distraction and interesting challenge,
        others seriously dislike it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overwhelmingly, all of the considerations here are about
    enabling participation.</p>
