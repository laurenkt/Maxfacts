<p>Treatment of postoperative (and post-injury) problems affecting
    the orbit (eye socket) ranges from the very urgent to long-term,
    less urgent issues and includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loss of vision. Orbital compartment syndrome (condition arising
        from increased pressure in the orbital space) is one
        of a small number of genuine maxillofacial emergencies.
        In a recently operated patient simply all the sutures
        closing the wound are removed and whatever is causing
        the increased pressure is let out. In a traumatic orbital
        compartment syndrome, a procedure called lateral cantholysis
        (making an incision around the outside attachments of
        the eyelids and opening the thick fascia) will allow
        release of the cause of compression (usually an accumulation
        of arterial blood). A drain is placed for 24 hours. An
        avulsed globe (knocked-out eyeball) can not be treated,
        any direct damage to the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">optic nerve</a>        is regarded as permanent (the fibres of the optic nerve
        are special, they behave like brain cells).</li>
    <li>Disturbance of vision. Change in the position of the globe
        of the eye or disturbance of the function of the relevant
        muscles leads to double vision. Correction is aimed at
        releasing any factors restricting movement of the relevant
        muscle (usually the inferior rectus muscle). This is
        usually done by reconstruction of the orbital floor with
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">bone or cartilage grafts</a>,
        titanium plates or PEEK (synthetic material) implants.
        In cases where reconstitution of the orbit does not improve
        vision, opthalmological input is necessary.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Disturbance in sensation</a>        . The nerve supplying feeling to the area of cheek below
        the eye runs in the floor of the orbit. This is a typical
        area for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">complex fractures of the cheekbone (zygoma or malar)</a>        as the bone in the area is so thin. Altered sensation
        in this area is common after <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage/getting-started">injury of soft</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">hard tissue</a>        or <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>. ‘Decompressing’
        the infra-orbital nerve as part of reducing the fracture
        may improve recovery. Surgically removing bone around
        a nerve giving rise to altered sensation may help although
        the benefits can not be promised. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiepileptics">Carbamazepine and gabapentin/pregabalin</a>        may help posttraumatic or postoperative <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">neuropathic pain</a>.</li>
    <li>Appearance. Basically, leave alone, mostly things settle
        down. Even ectropion (lower eyelid sagging outward) caused
        by scarring can improve with time, although scar revision
        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">full-thickness skin graft</a>        may be needed.</li>
</ul>
