<p>A variety of conditions ranging from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">unusual immune responses</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">unwanted effects of medications</a>    through to exposure to <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">high-energy radiation</a>    can cause necrosis (cell death). In bone this appears as
    sequestration where mineralised bits of bone with no blood
    supply are being shed out through the lining of the mouth.</p>
<p>Tiny pieces can appear following infection – even after something
    relatively simple like a tooth extraction followed by a severe
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">‘dry socket’</a>.</p>
<p>Rare responses to low grade irritation can cause a mixture of
    extra bone production and painful sequestration.</p>
<p>Medications such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">antiresorptive agents</a>    (like the group of bisphosphonate drugs commonly prescribed
    to treat osteoporosis (brittle bones)) have been clearly
    shown to predispose to chemical osteonecrosis of the jaws
    (ONJ). In fact these drugs can also cause abnormalities of
    the mucosa of the mouth but are better known for causing
    bone necrosis.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</a>, in particular
    radical irradiation with high doses (over 60 Gy) and especially
    when combined with <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>,
    can cause osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaws and other
    target bones. The jaws are exceptionally vulnerable in having
    structures embedded in the bone that also transgress a contaminated
    mucosa (the lining of the mouth) – teeth or implants.</p>
