<p>Here we contrast the normal joint function with general signs
    and symptoms of abnormal temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the diagnosis, signs and
        symptoms of specific temporomandibular joint disorders,
        this information is on our detailed page about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint/detailed">diagnosis of jaw joint disorders</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The TMJ is a synovial joint (a capsule connecting bones and filled
    with synovial fluid (lubricant for the joint)) in which the
    mandibular condyle (head of the mandible) articulates with
    the base of the skull at the glenoid fossa and articular
    eminence. Interposed between the two is the articular disc
    (or meniscus), the function of which is to contribute to
    the smooth action of the joint. The disc is also believed
    to be involved in many of the disorders commonly seen. The
    disk is divided into three zones: a thick posterior band,
    a thin intermediate zone and a slightly thicker but narrow
    anterior band.</p>
<p>The TMJ nerve supply arises from the mandibular division of the
    <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">trigeminal nerve</a>.
    The auriculotemporal nerve innervates most of the TMJ mainly
    anterolaterally (front/side) and small branches of the masseteric
    and deep temporal nerves supply the posterior (back) aspect.
    The TMJ vascular supply arises from the external carotid
    artery via the internal maxillary artery and the superficial
    temporal artery.</p>
<h1 id="normal-function-of-the-jaw-joint">Normal function of the jaw joint</h1>
<p>Normal movement in the temporomandibular joint should be smooth
    and pain free. Both jaw joints are almost (bone does have
    some plasticity) rigidly linked together by the horseshoe-shaped
    mandible and therefore move together - it is not possible
    for one joint to move without affecting the other. Consequently,
    any disorder of movement involving one joint will by necessity
    effect the opposite one.</p>
<p>Initial mouth opening (up to 1 cm) involves a hinge-type movement,
    analogous to that seen in the knee or phalanges (the bones
    making up hands and toes). However, the remainder (and the
    majority) of mouth opening involves a bodily shift, or translation,
    of the condyle (head of the mandible) as it moves down the
    articular eminence (the opposite part of the joint, involving
    the temporal bone, underneath the temple). Closure is essentially
    the reverse of this. Side to side movements of the mandible
    involves a mixture of rotation of each condyle through a
    vertical axis and a minor degree of lateral shift.</p>
<p>In the normal temporomandibular joint the meniscus (the disc
    that enables smooth movements of the joint) is placed on
    top of the condyle and the two move in harmony as the mandible
    moves. Movement of the disc is possible due to its elastic
    attachments and the attachment of the lateral pterygoid -
    an important muscle in mouth opening.</p>
<h1 id="symptoms-and-signs-of-abnormal-jaw-joint-function">Symptoms and signs of abnormal jaw joint function</h1>
<p><strong>Pain</strong> - this is probably the most common symptom.
    Pain may arise from the joint capsule, from ‘retrodiscal’
    tissues or associated muscles such as the lateral pterygoid
    or masseter. Often the pain can be well localised to the
    joint, making diagnosis relatively straight forward. However,
    referred pain or pain arising within the muscles can be experienced
    elsewhere. Pain aggravated by chewing or stressing the joint
    points heavily to a musculoskeletal cause.</p>
<p><strong>Joint noises</strong> – these are usually experienced
    as clicking and grating. They can occur in otherwise asymptomatic
    jaw joints. Grating noises may be experienced s a result
    of some destructive processes resulting in loss of the smooth
    articular surfaces and irregular joint movement. In mild
    cases no cause can be found, although arthroscopically (internal
    optical inspection) there may be evidence of mild degenerative
    changes with debris in the synovial fluid. The noises can
    be heard without the use of stethoscope amplification.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation of mouth opening,</strong> <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus"><strong>trismus</strong></a>    - it is important to draw a distinction between limitation
    of movement resulting from obstruction within the joint and
    that caused by muscle spasm.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint/more-info/figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example of trismus, opening less
        than 40 mm.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Deviation on mouth opening</strong> – normal mouth opening
    should be symmetrical and pain free, interincisal opening
    should approach 40 mm although this varies with height, occlusion
    and dentition (see Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint/more-info/figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Normal interincisal opening.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deviation may result from mechanical interference or pain. When
    deviation is prolonged, this new movement becomes subconscious
    and automatic and may continue after the initial cause has
    resolved (see Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint/more-info/figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Deviation on opening.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Clicking</strong> – distortion of the meniscus in the
    jaw joint prevents smooth movement of the condyle. The condyle
    may have to ‘jump’ over the periphery of the meniscus to
    continue moving. This is felt as a click.</p>
<p><strong>Locking</strong> – untreated, clicking may progress to
    locking: the meniscus becomes so abnormally shaped and displaces
    that is effectively acts like a door stop. This results in
    ‘locking’ of the jaw.</p>
<h1 id="imaging-studies-of-the-temporomandibular-joint">Imaging studies of the temporomandibular joint</h1>
<p>Plain X-ray radiographs are relatively easy to obtain in the
    clinic but they really play a minor role in detecting pathology
    of the jaw joint (see Figure 4 for examples).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint/more-info/figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Plain X-ray radiographs of a normal
        temporomandibular joint. Left: mouth open; right: mouth
        closed. Neither of these views is easy to interpret.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The temporomandibular joint is a complex three-dimensional structure
    and conventional radiographs only show a two-dimensional
    projection view, taken through one part of the joint. Only
    gross pathology can be picked up in this way (see Figure
    5 for an example).</p>

        a severely resorbed right condyle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>TMJ arthrography involves the direct injection of a contrast
    medium into one or both of the joint spaces and provides
    information on joint function, particularly that of the meniscus.
    TMJ arthrography is a technically demanding investigation
    (see Figure 6).</p>

        than plain X-ray radiographs but more readily interpreted.</figcaption>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>)
    is increasingly used in the study of the temporomandibular
    joint because it is particularly useful for visualising the
    associated soft tissues (for example disc, lateral pterygoid
    muscle <i>etc</i>.). MRI is also useful in studying the vascularity
    of the condyle. Currently MRI is the imaging modality of
    choice, although recent reports suggest an increasing role
    for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound scans</a>    in imaging of the temporomandibular joint.</p>
