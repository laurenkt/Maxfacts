<p>Facial appearance is unique amongst the topics discussed on this
    website in that it does not refer to any condition, or signs
    &amp; symptoms of a disease requiring medical treatment.
    Instead, facial appearance reflects somebody’s individual
    and subjective wish to have their facial appearance changed
    for aesthetic reasons alone. In this sense, facial aesthetic
    surgery raises pertinent questions. The mere fact of somebody’s
    desire to seek invasive surgical interventions to achieve
    some (perceived) degree of aesthetic improvement of facial
    features (for example, ‘westernisation’ of Asian faces, or
    unwillingness to embrace any visible signs of ageing) sometimes
    does put a spotlight on our societal mechanisms and values.</p>
<p>The branch of surgery concerned with body appearance, aesthetic
    (or cosmetic) surgery, overlaps with maxillofacial surgery
    when dealing with aesthetic facial surgery. For example,
    scar revision or some corrections of traumatic defects such
    as torn earlobes sit somewhere between the two fields. There
    are further overlaps of aesthetic facial surgery with fringe
    areas of <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery</a>    where functional <i>and</i> aesthetic reconstruction of the
    mouth, jaws or face after trauma (by accident or treatment
    modalities) or as a consequence of disease are in the centre
    of attention. Surgical treatment of some of the many different
    aspects of congenital head and neck malformations, such as
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">clefts of lip and palate</a>,
    also straddle the two surgical specialties.</p>
<p>Commonly performed procedures in purely aesthetic facial surgery
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>rhytidectomy (face lift, of which there are many different
        varieties)</li>
    <li>blepharoplasty (addressing puffy or sagging upper and/or
        lower eyelids, related: brow lift)</li>
    <li>otoplasty (improving the appearance of prominent ears (‘bat
        ears’))</li>
    <li>rhinoplasty (a range of corrections to the nose)</li>
    <li>genioplasty (movement or reshaping of the chin).</li>
</ul>
