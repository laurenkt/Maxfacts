<p>However strange it may sound, there are clear upsides to our
    ability to experience pain: some forms of pain provide a
    powerful protective mechanism for the body and are an effective
    part of nature’s strategy to support survival (in a supposedly
    dangerous environment).</p>
<p>The International Association for the Study of Pain defines pain
    as ‘an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated
    with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms
    of such damage’. This qualifies pain indirectly as a symptom,
    which in turn makes the tacit assumption of an underlying
    and identifiable physical pathological condition. When looking
    a little closer into the slightly mysterious multitude of
    conditions called pain, one can see that this definition
    could do with some slightly more imaginative and encompassing
    expansion. But one can also see that it is hard to define
    ‘this thing called pain’.</p>
<p>It is currently not possible to measure or otherwise quantify
    pain by any diagnostic tests or measurements (with some possible
    exceptions emerging from recent pre-clinical <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    studies of brain function and a range of <a href="/treatment/other/further-reading">further studies ongoing worldwide</a>),
    yet everybody will agree that intense pain is an all-consuming
    experience and requires urgent intervention. Verbal communication
    (where possible) about type and intensity of pain is at the
    centre of any attempts to curb pain.</p>
<p>Worldwide, analgesics (drugs to treat pain) are the most widely
    used medications (with a close second being <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotic agents</a>    for the treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>),
    yet for the treatment of some forms of pain we currently
    only have rather blunt instruments with limited efficiency
    and often a severe burden of unwanted effects. On the other
    hand, <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">anaesthesia</a>    has been developed to a very high level of control and is
    the major enabling mechanism for any <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>.</p>
<p>Broadly, two different types of pain need to be distinguished:
    acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain is part of the body’s
    alert and protection system, with a high and adaptive threshold
    for activation. An intense sudden cause (such as heat, cold,
    mechanical injury, irritating chemicals) triggers this immediate
    nociceptive pain sensation which typically overrides all
    other activities and initiates a withdrawal reflex. This
    nociceptive pain is essential in protecting the body from
    harm. There is a further variety of adaptive and protective
    pain experience which functions over a slightly more extended
    time scale and is sometimes referred to as inflammatory pain.
    Its protective role kicks in during the healing phase after
    tissue injury or infection; essentially a heightened sensitivity
    to stimuli reminds the body not to overuse a body part that
    is currently being repaired / healing and thus prevents further
    tissue damage and can promote healing. Both of the expressions
    of acute pain are transient, albeit on different time scales
    of action.</p>
<p>The second category of pain is chronic, not adaptive, and essentially
    results from some form of malfunction of the nervous system.
    The malfunction can be in the peripheral nervous system (where
    pain signal receptors are located), in the transmitting nerve
    fibres, or in the central processing of pain signals in the
    brain. This type of chronic pain is commonly referred to
    as neuropathic or pathological pain. It has no initiation
    threshold similar to that of acute pain as it is usually
    not triggered by an external signal (with a few noticeable
    exceptions), it has no protective function and typically
    is a lasting condition. One could thus argue that neuropathic
    pain should not be considered solely as a symptom but as
    a disease.</p>
<p>Clearly, these different types of pain require different control
    strategies and treatments, with the currently most unmet
    needs in the area of chronic pathological / <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">neuropathic pain</a>.</p>
<p>First, we will have a closer look at the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">mechanisms of pain sensation</a>,
    the mechanisms of local recording, transmission and central
    (brain) processing of pain signals and sensations. Equipped
    with this insight, we can discuss the different types of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesics</a>    and their working for different types of pain, including
    the many different options for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">delivery of medications</a>.
    In addition, we consider a range of other options for the
    management of pain conditions, including placebo effect,
    <a href="/help/mental-health">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/acupuncture">acupuncture</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/tens">nerve stimulation by electrodes</a>.</p>
