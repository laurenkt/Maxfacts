<p>Natural vitamin E is a mixture of a number of closely related
    compounds, tocopherols and tocotrienols (Figure 1). The fat-soluble
    vitamin E is found in high concentrations in plant-derived
    oils and fats. In these inanimate substances, the role of
    this mixture of tocopherols and tocotrienols is to act as
    antioxidants preventing the oils / fats from going rancid.
    Vitamin E, together with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), is well
    researched in this role as chemical food preservative. Synthetic
    ‘vitamin E’ is made up of a single component, <i>α</i>-tocopherol.</p>

<p>The exact role of tocopherols and/or tocotrienols in living biological
    systems, including humans, is much less clear and a matter
    of debate with a wide range of opinions. The only point where
    there is consensus, is that <i>α</i>-tocopherol is the one
    component of vitamin E that is most readily absorbed in the
    human intestines, although there is no clear agreement as
    to why that is the case. There is also general agreement
    that vitamin E deficiency is very rare. If it occurs, it
    causes neuronal dysfunctions, but any vitamin E deficiency
    is easily counteracted by appropriate dietary adjustments.</p>
<p>The views on the biochemical mechanism and physiological role(s)
    of vitamin E / tocopherol(s) in the human body are extremely
    diverse. Views include those that translate the purely antioxidative
    chemical role of tocopherols in inanimate substances to an
    analogous function in the living human body. Other views
    highlight anti-inflammatory properties, potential neuroprotection,
    immunomodulation and antiallergic effects, where overall
    the antioxidative properties are taken as secondary. A logical
    argument supporting this view is that there are many regulated
    controls in the body’s healthy physiology that maintain the
    correct levels of antioxidant substances. It is important
    to keep these concentrations in an appropriate range as there
    are many physiological functions that depend on radicals
    (for example, the <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">role of NO in haemostasis</a>)
    and are essential for the functioning of the body. This may
    explain, for example, the fast metabolization of several
    of the vitamin E components after ingestion. Many arguments
    are derived from <i>in vitro</i> laboratory experiments,
    often employing tocopherol / tocotrienol concentrations much
    higher than under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the views on the potential advantages and disadvantages
    of tocopherols / tocotrienols in the prevention and treatment
    of diseases is equally conflicted.</p>
<p>We discuss tocopherol here because it is one of the three components
    in the so called ‘triple therapy’ (or PENTOCLO), a controversial
    medication scheme originally proposed for the treatment of
    soft-tissue necrosis following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy treatment</a>    for breast cancer  and later also advertised for the treatment
    of <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue/detailed">osteoradionecrosis</a>.
    Osteoradionecrosis is a severe long-term (life-long) risk
    following radiotherapy in the head &amp; neck region. The
    cocktail of drugs consists of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/pentoxifylline">pentoxifylline</a>,
    tocopherol and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/clodronate">clodronate</a>.
    The argument to include tocopherol in the cocktail is based
    on its assumed antioxidative properties. The evidence base
    about the working principles of this <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">medication scheme</a>    and the related hypotheses about the pathology of osteoradionecrosis
    are conflicted. It is worth mentioning that in the UK the
    National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
    only recommends PENTOCLO / ‘triple therapy’ for the treatment
    of osteoradonecrosis of the jaws in the framework of clinical
    trials but not otherwise.</p>
