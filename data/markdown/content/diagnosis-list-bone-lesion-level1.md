<p>The bones that form our skeleton are the major structural organ
    that supports our bodies. The hard bone tissue supports the
    soft tissue of other internal organs; bones provide anchor
    points for most skeletal muscles and thus enable movement.
    In addition, bones protect the internal organs from injury
    (for example, the brain is protected by the skull), bones
    act as storage of minerals (and help the body balance its
    mineral metabolism) and the bone marrow plays an essential
    role in the production of red blood cells.</p>
<p>In line with the multiple tasks of bones in our bodies, bones
    consist of various different tissues: compact (cortical)
    and spongy (cancellous) bone tissue, as well as bone marrow,
    nerves, small blood vessels and epithelium (lining tissue)
    and a dense layer of connective tissue enveloping bones (periosteum).
    The compact, cortical bone tissue forms the outer layer of
    all bones; it is a dense and strong material.</p>
<p>Bones continually renew themselves, similar to the ongoing renewal
    of skin. There are two types of bone cells involved in this
    renewal process: osteoclasts break down bone tissue, and
    osteoblasts build new bone tissue. Osteoblasts form the mineralised
    connective tissue that we usually call bone; the mineralised
    material is a slightly disordered crystalline phosphate mineral,
    called hydroxyapatite.</p>
<p>Like any other organ in the body, bones also develop diseases
    and lesions. Excluding <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures (broken bones)</a>    here (discussed separately), bone lesions can be broadly
    divided into three groups:</p>
<ul>
    <li>inflammatory (including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bone infections</a>)
        and other non-neoplastic lesions</li>
    <li>benign neoplastic lesions (benign lumps)</li>
    <li>malignant neoplastic lesions (bone cancers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary malignant bone lesions are rare. Inflammatory bone lesions
    cover a fair range of conditions, as do benign neoplastic
    bone lesions â€“ and nearly all of these non-malignant bone
    conditions have considerable overlap with other systemic
    or local conditions (ranging from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">jaw cysts</a>    to rheumatoid arthritis, and everything in between).</p>
