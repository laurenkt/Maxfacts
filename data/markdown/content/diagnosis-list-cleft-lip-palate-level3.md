<h1 id="classification">Classification</h1>
<p>Numerous classifications exist but the most useful is to describe
    the actual deformity in words and these deformities have
    matching Read and ICD (International Classification of Diseases)
    codes. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cleft lip and palate – unspecified Read code P9, ICD code
        749</li>
    <li>cleft lip – Read code P91, ICD code 749.1</li>
    <li>cleft palate – Read code P90, ICD code 749.0</li>
    <li>cleft lip and palate – Read code P92, ICD code 749.2</li>
    <li>unilateral complete cleft lip and palate – Read code P921,
        ICD code 749.21</li>
    <li>bilateral complete cleft lip and palate – Read code P923,
        ICD code 749.23.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage in describing the actual deformity is that it links
    both the prognosis and treatment for the cleft. One of the
    disadvantages, however, is that the description may not be
    entirely accurate: cleft palate can mean anything from a
    cleft uvula through a cleft soft palate to cleft of the soft
    and hard palate. A small cleft of the soft palate is a relatively
    simple surgical problem with an extremely good long-term
    prognosis in most instances, whereas a wide complete cleft
    of the palate may be both difficult to close, particularly
    in the hard palate / soft palate junction, and can result
    in significant speech impediment and long-term growth disturbance
    due to scarring.</p>
<h1 id="prevalence">Prevalence</h1>
<p>Clefts of the lip and palate are the most common craniofacial
    malformations, and comprise 65 % of all anomalies affecting
    the head and neck. There are two useful distinct types of
    cleft anomaly, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and
    isolated cleft palate. There is a difference in the pathogenesis
    (see below) of the two.</p>
<h2>Cleft lip and palate</h2>
<p>Amongst white people there is an incidence of approximately 1
    : 750 live births, with an increase in prevalence. In Germany
    it is well accepted that there is an incidence of 1 : 500.
    The figure 1 : 1000 has been used in international terms
    as incidence varies between races and nationalities. The
    difficulty of accurate data collection in international terms
    has been discussed at length in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">specialist texts</a>.</p>
<p>Family history can be found in around 40 % of cases although
    the actual genetics of cleft lip and palate are extremely
    complex. The commonly quoted statistic is that the risk for
    unaffected parents having a second child with the anomaly
    is around 1 : 20. Clefts of lip and palate are commoner in
    males than females and more often affect the left side. The
    cleft is often more severe if it arises in the less common
    variant, that is in a female on the right. It should be noted
    that the prevalent statistics for cleft lip and palate vary
    widely both geographically and between different racial groups
    (orientals approximately 1 : 425 live births, afro-caribbeans
    approximately 1 : 3000 live births).</p>
<h2>Isolated cleft palate</h2>
<p>This cleft occurs in around 1 : 2000 live births and is commoner
    in females than males. A genetic history is less clear in
    these, there is said to be a family history in approximately
    20 % of cases, and the risk to further offspring is around
    1 : 80. Isolated cleft palate is often found in other syndromes
    such as Down syndrome, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies">craniofacial syndromes</a>    such as Treacher-Collins syndrome and Pierre Robin syndrome,
    and bone disorders such as Klippel-Feil syndrome.</p>
<h1 id="aetiology">Aetiology</h1>
<p>The aetiology of cleft is multi-factorial. The mechanics of clefting
    are thought to be a failure of fusion of the embryological
    processes that comprise the upper lip at the sixth week of
    intrauterine life.</p>
<p>The hard and soft palates are formed by a different mechanism.
    The process described is a ‘flip up’ of the palatal shelf
    from a vertical to a horizontal position, followed by fusion
    to form the secondary palate around the eighth week <i>in utero</i>.
    This requires these embryological processes both to move
    into position by the process of ‘flip up’ and to grow until
    they come into contact. Failure of growth, the ‘flip up’
    process or breakdown of the overlying epithelium to allow
    the flow of mesenchyme (early, foetal undifferentiated cells
    that develop into connective tissues) to create a solid structure
    can all result in clefting of the palate.</p>
<p>One of the suggestions to explain why isolated cleft palate is
    more common in females than males is because the process
    of transposition of the palatal shelves occurs later in the
    female foetus, therefore a greater opportunity exists for
    environmental insult to affect successful ‘flip up’.</p>
<p>Submucous clefts have been reported to be the most common form
    of cleft in the posterior palate – 1 : 1200 normal children.
    Common abnormalities include hyper-nasality, chronic otitis
    media, nasal regurgitation. The signs that may be indicative
    of a submucous cleft include: bifid uvula, translucent palatal
    raphe area, palpable notch in the midline of the posterior
    hard palate and triangular muscle ridging on palatal elevation.
    The most common reason for treating a person with a submucous
    cleft palate is because of abnormal, nasal-sounding speech.</p>
<h1 id="issues-in-the-management-of-cleft-lip-and-palate">Issues in the management of cleft lip and palate</h1>
<p>Approximately 20 % of babies with clefts, particularly those
    with isolated cleft palates, will have associated congenital
    abnormalities often of the heart or extremities.</p>
<p>Failure of growth and the pre-existing cleft lead to clear aesthetic
    issues. The growth problems have also in the past been made
    remarkably worse by post-surgical scarring and distortion.
    Concerns highlighted by the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">Eurocleft Study</a>    around multiple interventions in cleft children in a disjointed
    and discordant fashion coupled with observations on the adequate
    growth patterns in individuals with unoperated clefts, raised
    concerns that in some instances post-surgical distortion
    due to scarring and inappropriately timed or performed surgery
    created defects to rival the clefts themselves.</p>
<p>In the UK this problem has been addressed by a national recommendation
    that the treatment of cleft lip and palate should be centralised
    to centres which could be adequately audited and consisted
    of a team, cleft surgeon, orthodontist, speech and language
    therapist, otorhinolaryngologist, specialised nursing, clinical
    genetics advice, paediatric intensive care facilities and
    the opportunity for neo-natal counselling and specialist
    health visitors. Adequate access to paediatric dentistry
    and restorative dentistry were essential as was access to
    appropriate psychological support. Within the UK there has
    been a very gradual move towards co-ordinated teams such
    as these managing all cleft patients in a region, creating
    the opportunity for high volume auditable outcomes. The opportunities
    for development of individual expertise and training become
    self-evident as does the restriction of practice to a very
    limited number of people with the inherent potential problems
    this could create.</p>
<p>In Germany there are no regulations concerning treatment of cleft
    lip and palate. It is the patient (parent) who has to make
    the decision where the child is to be treated. Of course,
    there are chatrooms, brochures and a lot of information,
    especially via the internet. Usually these patients are treated
    at university hospitals or at least hospitals with major
    oral &amp; maxillofacial surgery units. There is competition
    between the hospitals to treat these patients. Competition
    is felt to be one precondition for good results. Given the
    ‘centralisation’ concept now solidified into the UK NHS system
    was based on the results of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">Eurocleft Study</a>,
    it is fascinating to see how the major European country has
    responded.</p>
<p>In the USA, while degrees of specialisation are widely accepted,
    it would be hard to imagine the state dictating to parents
    or patients where and how they or their child should be treated.
    There are few areas of elective surgical practice that have
    been subjected to what is clearly a political differentiation
    rather than one based on objective outcome criteria. One
    can see, at least in this instance, the common Northern American
    criticism of the UK NHS as ‘socialised medicine’. What will
    be genuinely fascinating will be the long-term outcomes produced
    by such a process compared to similar centralised systems
    for example in China, compared to outcomes from Germany and
    the USA - objectively and independently assessed.</p>
<h2>Lip repair</h2>
<p>In general, neo-natal lip repair, that is very early lip repair
    has fallen into disrepute, most surgeons will undertake lip
    repair between three and six months old. The classical rule
    was the rule of 10 which is still referred to (the child
    is 10 weeks old, 10 kg in weight, and has a haemoglobin above
    10 g/dl). Even allowing for generalisation this seems to
    suggest rather obese babies. In Germany the rule is that
    operation is not before 3 months of age and not under 5 kg
    in weight. Usually at the age of 3 months the babies have
    7 or 8 kg of maximum weight.</p>
<h2>Palate repair</h2>
<p>Closure of the palate in the UK is generally relatively early;
    the principle here is to attempt to close the palate before
    the development of speech and a hyper-nasal speech pattern.
    In some European countries closure of the hard palate is
    delayed in order to minimise the unwanted effects of early
    surgery upon growth. This may improve transverse growth of
    the maxilla but there is an obvious compromise in terms of
    speech development. In Germany there are also a lot of different
    concepts concerning sequence and timing of the operation.
    The common opinion is that the palate should be closed latest
    at the age of 2 years.</p>
