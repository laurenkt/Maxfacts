<p>Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid (Figure 1), is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)</a>.
    It works similarly to other NSAIDs as an analgesic but has
    additional effects on <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">blood clotting</a>    and is a widely prescribed <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiplatelet">antiplatelet medication</a>,
    prescribed for example to prevent arterial thrombosis, or
    as prophylaxis after stroke.</p>

<p>For 3500 years, willow bark was used as an analgesic with the
    active agent in it being salicin. The metabolism/oxidation
    of salicin leads to salicylic acid (Figure 2), the precursor
    of aspirin. Salicylic acid has the same analgesic properties
    as salicin but causes gastric irritation and so is not tolerated
    well as a drug.</p>

<p>In 1852, Charles Gerhardt, a French chemist, attempted to modify
    salicylic acid to give acetylsalicylic acid but his product
    was not stable and hence was not used as a medicinal drug.
    In the 1890s, a pharmaceutical company began research into
    making a drug that had the same analgesic action as salicylic
    acid but lacked the adverse gastrointestinal effects. They
    managed to modify salicylic acid to give a stable form of
    acetylsalicylic acid (Figure 3) in 1897 and named it aspirin.
    Aspirin is a 100 times more potent analgesic than salicylic
    acid.</p>

<p>Aspirin fell in and out of favour over the years as new <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesic agents</a>    with (assumed) fewer side effects, such as paracetamol and
    ibuprofen, were discovered. Aspirin, however, remains in
    use, in part due to its antiplatelet effects.</p>
<p>Like other NSAIDs, aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase (COX)
    enzymes. Blocking or inhibiting COX enzymes inhibits the
    production of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">prostaglandins and thromboxanes</a>,
    which are key contributors in the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammatory response</a>.
    Thromboxanes promote aggregation of platelets and clotting.
    Inhibition of their production is thought to produce an analgesic
    effect.</p>
<p>The COX enzymes insert into the lipid membrane of a cell and
    form hydrophobic channels to a catalytic site. Aspirin blocks
    this catalytic site or channel irreversibly which gives long-lasting
    inhibitory action on the COX enzymes. Aspirin also specifically
    redirects the metabolic activity of the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">COX-2 enzyme</a>    to the formation of aspirin-triggered so-called lipoxins
    (short-lived, biochemically active metabolites) with anti-inflammatory
    effects. One of these lipoxins is known to reduce inflammatory
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">hyperalgesia</a>    (increased sensitivity to pain); some lipoxins are thought
    to be important in the resolution of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal disease</a>.</p>
<p>In its function as an antiplatelet agent, aspirin supresses the
    normal function of platelets also by (long-lasting) inhibition
    of the COX enzymes. This inhibits thromboxane synthesis for
    several days, stopping the production of platelet aggregation
    factors. As the inhibition is long-lasting, the effect on
    the platelet aggregation factor is over the lifetime of the
    affected platelet (8 to 9 days). Inhibiting the formation
    of platelet aggregation factors hinders the normal <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">clotting process</a>.</p>
<p>Aspirin has similar adverse effects as do other NSAIDs, including
    the risk of gastric ulcers and an increased risk of bleeding
    in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
