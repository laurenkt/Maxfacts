<p>Most diagnoses can be established by a combination of a thorough
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">examination</a>    with evidence from a variety of tests (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/urine-tests">urine</a>, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microbiology</a>)
    and imaging information (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>) as
    required. In some cases additional examination of samples
    of tissue or cells, a biopsy, is necessary either to confirm
    or to exclude certain conditions. A biopsy is not usually
    the first line of investigation because of its invasive nature.</p>
<p>In a maxillofacial clinic the most common reasons for a biopsy
    are to exclude serious pathology (often in patches of white
    mucosa or other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">growths of mucosa</a>)
    or to obtain further and/or definitive diagnostic information
    about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">suspected cysts</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems</a>    and all kinds of lumps, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump">benign</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">malignant</a>. The purpose
    of a biopsy is to confirm absence or presence of certain
    conditions, in addition to examining the extent of certain
    conditions.</p>
<p>There are various kinds of biopsies, almost all of them can be
    undertaken in a clinic or outpatient setting. Biopsies can
    be taken of hard (bone) and soft tissues, or can be used
    to extract cells and/or fluids. In most cases biopsies are
    carried out under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local anaesthesia</a>.</p>
<p>An <strong>excisional biopsy</strong> is the most comprehensive
    variety: the entire lesion is removed and the removed tissue
    is investigated afterwards. Logic suggests that an excisional
    biopsy is the method of choice if the lesion needs removing
    and can be removed in a straightforward way, irrespective
    of its exact nature. This combined diagnostic and therapeutic
    approach saves a second surgical intervention later on.</p>
<p>An <strong>incisional biopsy</strong> or a <strong>core needle biopsy</strong>    remove only some of the tissue of a lesion but do not aim
    to remove the entire lesion in the session. It is obviously
    important to choose a representative area of the lesion for
    taking specimen tissue; it is mainly for this reason that
    often more than one small sample is taken.</p>
<p>An incisional biopsy for lesions on or near the body surface
    uses a small incision to extract a tissue sample, or several
    samples. A scalpel or some special cutting device (which
    functions similarly to a cookie cutter, called a punch biopsy)
    may be used to obtain the sample<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>A core needle biopsy uses a range of needles to extract an intact
    rod of lesion tissue (similar to extracting columns of arctic
    ice, core samples, by drilling with – very large – core needles
    into the arctic ice sheet in climate research). Needle biopsies
    may require guiding by imaging methods usually to ensure
    optimal placement of the needle in the lesion. A common such
    imaging guide for needle biopsies in the head and neck region
    is <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound scanning</a>    but other imaging techniques (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT (X-ray)</a>) in
    principle are also available for the purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Fine needle aspiration biopsies</strong> (also called
    fine needle aspiration cytology, FNAC) differ in that these
    biopsies do not extract a preserved small specimen of tissue
    but only draw cells or fluids by means of a thin needle connected
    to a syringe.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histopathological examinations</a>    also have a role during and after surgery. All surgically
    removed specimens are sent to the pathology laboratory for
    final assessment. When malignant lesions are surgically removed,
    a quick ‘on the fly’ examination (under a microscope) of
    frozen sections of the resected tissue from the margin of
    the specimen can help to determine if the surgical margin
    is clear (‘negative margin’, that is healthy issue) or if
    a wider excision is necessary if a ‘positive margin’ is found.
    This is popular in some countries and can be useful in circumstances
    where it is important to keep the excision margin safe but
    at a minimum. Mohs’ surgery in the treatment of <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer">facial skin cancer</a>    is a very specialised variation of the principle where chemically
    prepared sections are examined.   </p>
<p>A thorough pathological and histological examination of a tissue
    sample from a biopsy usually takes several days and involves
    a range of investigations. The aim of these investigations
    is to unambiguously classify the lesion tissue. In the vast
    majority of cases this classification (diagnosis) is achieved
    but some conditions do present a challenge for definitive
    clinical and histological / pathological diagnosis (for example,
    polymorphous low grade <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">adenocarcinoma of salivary glands</a>    may need several expert reviews).</p>
<p>Pathology and histology (microscopic structure of tissues) examination
    includes assessment of the tissue under a microscope and
    requires preparations of small parts of the sample for microscopic
    (histology) and further biochemical investigations. The pathology
    laboratory reports back to the surgeon who will share and
    explain the results in a follow-up meeting.</p>
