<p>Treatments of postoperative problems affecting the thigh include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scar management of the primarily closed flap donor site,
        including <a href="/help/physiotherapy">scar massage</a>.</li>
    <li>Skin graft. Painful raw superficial wound is left to granulate,
        so the wrap around dressing is very important. The area
        will look and feel raw for at least 10 days even if not
        infected or irritated. If that happens it will be raw
        and painful for longer. Long term wound management for
        scarring, discomfort and altered sensation may be needed.</li>
    <li>Evacuation of seroma (a build-up of clear fluid in tissue).
        The thigh as a donor site is actually quite minimal in
        terms of impeding mobility. This means that the potential
        for creating a seroma is quite high. These sometimes
        need to be aspirated and a compression dressing placed
        while keeping mobile.</li>
    <li>Vastus / anterolateral thigh flap will benefit from <a href="/help/physiotherapy">physiotherapy and suitable exercises</a>.</li>
</ul>
