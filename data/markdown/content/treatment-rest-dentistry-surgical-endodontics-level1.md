<p><a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">Non-surgical endodontics</a>,
    also known as root canal treatment, is the first-line treatment
    option to deal with dental pulp that is <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflamed</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infected</a>.
    It is a common dental treatment technique that accesses the
    pulp and the root canals through the crown of the tooth.
    The aim of root canal treatment is to access and clean up
    these infected areas by removing the pulp, and afterwards
    to seal the cleaned cavity (root filling) to prevent further
    infection in the future. It follows the philosophy that wherever
    reasonably possible, natural teeth and their structures should
    be preserved.</p>
<p>Even if nowadays the success rates for root canal treatment are
    high, failed conventional root canal treatments remain the
    main indication for surgical endodontics, essentially as
    a salvage option only to be considered if a second, conventional
    root canal treatment attempt is not possible (or also failed).
    Obviously, the cause of failure of the initial root canal
    treatment needs to be established before considering surgical
    endodontics. However, there are further indications for surgical
    endodontic interventions, including</p>
<ul>
    <li>obtaining a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>        from a lesion in the area near the tip (periapical) of
        a tooth root;</li>
    <li>repairing defects of, or damage to, a tooth root;</li>
    <li>resecting / removing parts of a tooth with complicated multiple
        roots that are inaccessible to conventional, non-surgical
        endodontics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The surgical endodontics approach is a different access route
    to the dental root canals and pulp and as a result is less
    useful in obtunding the entire root canal system. Rather
    than through the crown of a tooth, access is gained through
    an incision in the gingiva (gums), a flap is raised to access
    the tip of the tooth root(s) directly. There are several
    stages of the procedure (the majority of which are carried
    out in an outpatient setting):</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local analgesia</a>;</li>
    <li>incision and raising of a suitable flap for access;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">haemostasis</a>        (reducing bleeding) to maintain good visibility in the
        area;</li>
    <li>identification of the root apex (tip of the root);</li>
    <li>periapical curettage (clearing the area surrounding the tip
        of the root);</li>
    <li>root end resection (removal of the tip of the root);</li>
    <li>root and cavity preparation;</li>
    <li>root end (retrograde) filling;</li>
    <li>wound closure.</li>
</ul>
