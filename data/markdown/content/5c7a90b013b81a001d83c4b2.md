<h1 id="impacted-or-ectopic-teeth">Impacted or ectopic teeth</h1>
<p>Although any tooth may become impacted (its path of eruption
    is obstructed), those affected commonly are the lower third
    molars, upper canines, upper second premolars and upper incisors.
    These teeth may also be ectopically placed (their follicle
    develops in a remote position). Untreated, many impacted
    or ectopic teeth cause no problems and remain largely asymptomatic.
    However, a significant number may either develop complications
    or, if an anterior tooth is affected, may cause aesthetic
    or functional problems.</p>
<p>If a decision is taken not to undertake active intervention,
    the affected tooth must be kept under close observation,
    both clinically and where appropriate <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiographically</a>.
    Complications of impacted or ectopic teeth include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>prevention of eruption of adjacent tooth;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cystic</a> change in associated
        follicle, a rare occurrence;</li>
    <li>resorption of adjacent teeth with loss of vitality; this
        most commonly occurs with upper canines resorbing the
        roots of upper lateral and central incisors. Initiation
        of this process is however extremely rare after 15 years
        of age.</li>
</ul>
<p>In view of these rare complications, the value of routine
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiographic screening</a> of impacted or ectopic teeth is
        controversial, especially in view of recent radiation
        exposure guidelines. As complications are relatively
        rare the benefit of repeated radiographs is limited.
        Therefore, the decision to regularly radiograph such
        teeth is a difficult one, especially if they have been
        quiescent and asymptomatic for a number of years.</p>
<p>If ectopic or impacted teeth are partially erupted then they
    are at risk of the usual complications, particularly if their
    position prevents adequate <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    measures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>advanced <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">caries</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal">periodontal disease</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third molar teeth (wisdom teeth)</h2>
<p>The commonest cause for failure of a tooth to erupt is lack of
    space into which it can pass. Other reasons include malposition
    of the follicle or congenital absence. Rarely other associated
    pathology such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>,
    odontomes (irregularly grown dental tissue) or tumours will
    prevent eruption. Treatment is then directed at this underlying
    pathology. Developmental conditions such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies">cleidocranial dysostosis</a>    (a congenital condition affecting mostly bones and teeth)
    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft lip and palate</a>    are associated with an increased incidence of unerupted third
    molars. In the presence of an obstruction (such as another
    tooth), the unerupted tooth is said to be impacted.</p>
<p>Third molars normally erupt between the ages of 17 and 21 although
    later eruption can occur. Because they are the last teeth
    to erupt, they have the least space available and therefore
    they commonly impact. Soft western diets have also been implicated,
    as the absence of attrition between the adjacent lower teeth
    does not provide any additional space for the teeth to erupt
    into. It is often possible to assess the potential for eruption
    by the age of 16 on the basis of clinical examination and
    the use of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiographs</a>.</p>
<p>Prophylactic removal of third molars is no longer considered
    justifiable in the UK (although this is not so clear cut
    in terms of recommendations by representative bodies in some
    other countries) and the concept of “lateral trepanation”
    (removal of the third molar as a follicle) has passed into
    history. The decision to remove third molars depends on a
    balance between symptoms or pathology and relative risks
    in removing them (such as injury to inferior alveolar and/or
    lingual nerve, risk of fracture). If one third molar needs
    removing under a <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthetic</a>    it may be worth considering whether the opposite side should
    be removed at the same time. This is a balance of avoiding
    a second general anaesthetic in the future and the risks
    of complications in otherwise asymptomatic teeth. Table 1
    summarises indications and contraindications for removal
    of third molar teeth.</p>

<p>The commonest indication is recurrent pericoronitis. Pericoronitis
    is <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a> of the
    mucosal flap (operculum) overlying a partially erupted tooth,
    usually the lower third molar (Figure 1). Pericoronitis may
    be acute or chronic.</p>

        through the lower left third molar. Note the apical area
        around the lower right second molar tooth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Assessment of the tooth is both clinical and radiographic. If
    somebody presents in pain, it is important to establish that
    this is coming from the third molar and not elsewhere. Pain
    is often vague, poorly localised and may be referred from
    another tooth, or as part of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">facial arthromyalgia</a>    (condition affecting the jaw joint). A <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">dental panoramic radiograph</a>    is ideal as it helps to assess all the teeth at once. The
    health of the adjacent molars may influence the decision
    whether to remove the third molar or not. Large crowns or
    old restorations are all at risk of dislodgement during surgery.
    It is also worth considering whether alternative treatment
    options are available. For instance, pericoronitis due to
    an over-erupted upper third molar may be dealt with by extracting
    that tooth only, with or without operculectomy. In the presence
    of other teeth of poor prognosis, will it be better in the
    long term to save the third molar which may be used as a
    denture or bridge abutment in the future?</p>
<p>Having established that the wisdom tooth needs to be removed,
    other points in the assessment include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>tooth position (vertical, mesioangular, distoangular, horizontal
        or across the arch).</li>
    <li>depth and degree of impaction;</li>
    <li>obstruction to eruption (what is the tooth impacted against?);</li>
    <li>root morphology (the curvature of the roots controls the
        path of withdrawal);</li>
    <li>relationship to the inferior dental nerve canal;</li>
    <li>associated pathology (for example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>);</li>
    <li>bone density;</li>
    <li>status of second molar tooth (in selected cases where this
        tooth has a poor prognosis it may be better to extract
        it and leave the third molar).</li>
</ul>
<p>These points help to determine whether the tooth can be simply
    elevated or will need a <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth">surgical approach</a>.
    A series of radiographs depicted in Figure 4 to Figure 8
    illustrate these points further.</p>

<h2>Canines</h2>
<p>The incidence of impaction of the maxillary canine is between
    0.9 and 2.2 %. It is twice as common in females as in males,
    and is much more common palatally (toward the palate) than
    buccally (toward the cheek). The incidence of impacted lower
    canines is low. Many aetiological factors have been cited
    including generalised systemic causes, crowding, prolonged
    retention or early loss of the deciduous canine, ectopic
    development of the tooth bud, presence of an alveolar cleft,
    ankyloses (joint or other bone fusion, including fusion of
    a tooth with bone), formation of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump">neoplasms</a>, or
    dilacerations of the root. Palatal impaction is known to
    be more common in individuals with diminutive or absent lateral
    incisors. This has led to the theory that the lateral incisor
    root is important to guide the canine into position, although
    this theory is unproven and perhaps simplistic. Impacted
    upper canines, both palatal and buccal, are often causes
    of lateral incisor resorption and this tends to be initiated
    relatively early before the age of 11 (Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Top: radiograph showing severe
        resorption of both upper lateral incisors by ectopic
        canines; bottom: appearance of the upper lateral incisors
        after their removal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Permanent upper canines normally erupt around 11 to 12 years
    of age. If they cannot be palpated in the buccal sulcus by
    9 to 10 years of age, then a thorough clinical and radiographic
    investigation should be undertaken to accurately locate them.
    If the canine is buccally placed it can usually be palpated
    and the lateral incisor may appear proclined, as its root
    has had to take up a relatively palatal position in order
    to accommodate the buccally placed root. If, however, the
    canine is palatally placed then the lateral root is usually
    in a normal position. A bulge may be palpable palatally,
    although this is often only present when the canine is relatively
    superficial in older patients. Radiographic investigations
    should be used in order to localise the canines and to assess
    the condition of the roots of adjacent teeth. In a significant
    proportion of cases some root resorption occurs, although
    this is rarely severe.</p>
<p>If ectopic canine development is identified at an early stage,
    interceptive treatment can be instigated in order to correct
    the canine’s eruptive path. This involves the removal of
    the deciduous predecessor and has a good success rate especially
    in less severe cases where there is no crowding.</p>
<h2>Failure of incisor eruption</h2>
<p>Failure of eruption of upper incisors is relatively rare and
    can occur for many reasons including previous trauma, root
    dilacerations (distorted shape; see Figure 10), presence
    of a supernumerary tooth, local failure of eruptive mechanisms,
    or the presence of pathology. If an upper central incisor
    is noted to be delayed in its eruption, then a thorough clinical
    and radiographic examination is warranted. This would be
    the case if it remains unerupted significantly after their
    expected time of eruption (at 6 to 7 years of age), if one
    incisor is unerupted over six months after its contra-lateral
    partner, or if it is unerupted after the eruption of the
    lateral incisors.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Radiographic views of a dilacerated
        upper central incisor.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clinical examination should note the status of the primary dentition,
    the position and angulation of adjacent teeth, and involve
    the palpation of the buccal sulcus and palatal vault. Primary
    radiographic investigation of the area should identify the
    reason for failure of eruption and an upper anterior occlusal
    is a useful view to do this. Radiographs should be examined
    for evidence of supernumerary teeth, root dilacerations,
    and to ensure an intact periodontal ligament. If failure
    of eruption is due to dilaceration of the root, orthodontic
    alignment will only be possible if the degree of dilaceration
    is not severe.</p>
<p>If failure of eruption is due to severe dilaceration, ankylosis
    or resorption (internal or external) then the only option
    is to extract the tooth. This should be undertaken in the
    same manner as for any unerupted tooth; accurate localization,
    adequate surgical exposure and careful removal. If the unerupted
    incisor(s) appear(s) of normal morphology with no obvious
    cause for their failure of eruption, then they should be
    exposed and given the opportunity to erupt.</p>
<h2>Other ectopic teeth</h2>
<p>The same principles used in the treatment of ectopic canines
    can be applied to other ectopic or impacted teeth. The underlying
    principle to consider is whether it is possible, desirable
    and necessary to align the tooth. If greater harm or little
    benefit will accrue, then it is probable that another course
    of action should be undertaken</p>
<h2>Infraoccluded primary teeth</h2>
<p>Infraocclusion (insufficient projection to reach normal occlusal
    plane) of primary teeth is relatively common and is caused
    by a focal area of ankylosis preventing normal eruption occurring
    during dentoalvelor development. It is often self-limiting
    with the tooth either re-erupting or being exfoliated prior
    to the eruption of its permanent successor.</p>
<p>Occasionally severe infraocclusion occurs. This is defined as
    when the marginal ridge of the primary tooth is below the
    level of the gingival margin. In these situations, the tooth
    should be extracted. These extractions are usually uneventful
    with the area of ankylosis not causing any significant problem.
    Occasionally, when the infraocclusion occurs early, the deciduous
    tooth totally submerges and not only prevents eruption of
    its successor but may cause adjacent teeth to tip towards
    the infraoccluded tooth, restrict development of the dentoalveolus
    (leading to lateral open bites), or, because of its continued
    communication with the oral cavity, may lead to <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">decay</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal">periodontal disease</a>    or <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/surgical-endodontics">periapical pathology</a>.
    In these cases, it will be appropriate to remove the tooth
    and the technique employed will depend on accurate localization
    of the tooth by clinical and radiographic examination (Figure
    11 and Figure 12).</p>

        right second primary molar (URE) preventing eruption

</figure>
<h1 id="supernumerary-teeth">Supernumerary teeth</h1>
<p>Supernumerary teeth are relatively rare with an incidence of
    1 to 3 % in the permanent dentition and 0.3 to 0.6 % in the
    primary dentition. The vast majority are located in the maxilla
    (90 to 98 %) with most of these found in the premaxilla.</p>
<p>Supernumerary teeth can be described by their morphology, being
    either rudimentary or supplemental. Supplemental supernumeraries
    tend to erupt and are then usually extracted to allow normal
    alignment of neighbouring teeth.</p>
<p>There are three types of rudimentary supernumeraries:</p>
<ul>
    <li>conical – these have normal root development and can be inverted.
        They are usually positioned between the upper incisors
        but can become palatally placed as the rest of the dentition
        develops forwards and downwards;</li>
    <li>tuberculate – these are barrel-shaped teeth with little or
        no root formation:</li>
    <li>complex/compound odontomes (irregularly grown dental tissue).</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision on whether treatment is required is dependent on
    the site of the supernumerary and whether they will affect
    the eruption or development of adjacent teeth. In order to
    localise the position of the supernumerary, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray images</a>    are required. This could be a panoramic radiograph in combination
    with a second plain film X-ray image to provide a second
    viewing angle, or a CBCT scan (Figure 13).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Supernumerary teeth preventing
        the eruption of the upper left incisor (UL1).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Conical supernumeraries</strong> often erupt and in these
    cases often have no effect on adjacent tooth eruption but
    may affect tooth position. They can also be a rare cause
    of a median diastema (gap between front teeth). If they erupt
    then they should be extracted. Inverted conical supernumeraries
    will not erupt and may, depending on their position, affect
    adjacent tooth development. If this is the case then they
    should be <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth">surgically extracted</a>.
    <strong>Tuberculate supernumeraries</strong> often develop
    in the cingulum area (region at the base of the crown of
    the tooth) of the upper central incisors and are a common
    cause of the failure of upper incisors to erupt.</p>
<p>If a supernumerary is present and preventing tooth eruption it
    requires removal. The decision as to how and when to undertake
    treatment involves thorough assessment of the severity of
    the problem, general factors including somebody’s attitude
    to treatment, and what other treatment may be required. Both
    immediate and delayed removal of supernumerary teeth has
    been advocated.</p>
<p>Immediate or early intervention for all supernumerary teeth has
    the advantage that it prevents or minimises disturbance of
    the development of surrounding teeth. However, it does place
    adjacent teeth at risk of damage and may not be necessary
    as no problems may ensue. Delayed treatment ensures there
    is less risk of damage to adjacent teeth, a significant risk
    in younger patients with incomplete root formation.</p>
<p>The decision as to whether to undertake immediate or delayed
    treatment has therefore caused much debate. Conical supernumeraries
    should be left under observation unless they are causing
    developmental disturbance. Tuberculate and inverted conical
    supernumeraries should be removed immediately if this can
    be achieved with no harm to adjacent teeth. If, however,
    the upper central incisors have erupted, treatment should
    be delayed until after the eruption of the lateral incisors,
    as early treatment will not have any significant effect on
    tooth position.</p>
<h1 id="factors-to-consider-in-conjunction-with-orthodontic-treatment-planning">Factors to consider in conjunction with orthodontic treatment
    planning</h1>
<p>Orthodontic treatment is primarily concerned with the growth
    of the face, development of the dentition and the prevention
    and correction of malocclusion. As such, there is much that
    oral (and/or maxillofacial) surgeons and orthodontists can
    offer each other when treating patients, with very often
    a joint approach being necessary. Surgical techniques that
    may help the orthodontist include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>removal of impacted or ectopic teeth (Figure 14);</li>
    <li>treatment of impacted supernumerary teeth;</li>
    <li>removal of infraoccluded primary teeth;</li>
    <li>exposure of unerupted teeth;</li>
    <li>tooth transplantation;</li>
    <li>single tooth osteotomy;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic surgery</a>        .</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 14:</strong> An extreme example of a migrating
        ectopic tooth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The presence of a malocclusion as such does not indicate a need
    for treatment. Also, there are often many different treatment
    options and only by consideration of all factors can the
    most appropriate treatment be determined. These factors include:</p>
<ul>

<p>In determining the most appropriate treatment when a combination
    of <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth">dentoalveolar surgery</a>    and orthodontics may be required, it is imperative that the
    patient and those undertaking both the surgery and orthodontics
    all have a full understanding of the aims of treatment. This
    is best achieved by undertaking a joint consultation where
    the risks and benefits of all options can be discussed and
    considered. While the age at which treatment starts seems
    to vary from country to country, there seem to be little
    differences in clinical practice.</p>
