<p>Prostheses are adapted to craniofacial implants with
    either magnets or retentive buttons, or in some
    instances custom fitted bars to provide retention and
    anchorage points for the ear, eye or nasal prosthesis
    being used.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to describe the process of
    placing craniofacial implants and the more <a href="/treatment-surgery-implants-level3">time
        consuming and complex process of creating the
        prosthesis</a> is by illustration. Here are some
    examples. We briefly describe rehabilitation by a
    prosthetic nose, by a more complicated prosthesis after
    extensive loss of mixed tissues, by repair of an orbital
    fracture, and by prosthetic replacement of a large skull
    bone defect.</p>
<h1 id="a-prosthetic-nose">A prosthetic nose</h1>
<p>If part of the face has to be removed, for example the
    nose (Figure 1), in treatment with curative intent of
    skin cancer, such as an extended <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer">squamous
        cell carcinoma</a> of the nose, the first stage,
    after wound healing, is to make an impression of the
    part of the body where the resection took place.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> An impression is
        taken of the wound after healing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then craniofacial implants (shorter length than <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental
        implants</a>) are inserted in suitable bone matrix
    (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-implants-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> An example of
        inserted craniofacial implants in remaining nasal
        bone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next, a <a href="/treatment-surgery-implants-level3">specialist
        maxillofacial technician</a> creates the nose on a
    plaster model (Figure 4) and finally colours the
    prosthesis. In this case, magnets are used to retain the
    new nose to the implants (Figure 5; the magnets used for
    such purposes are tiny, yet powerful, permanent
    magnets).</p>

    resection</h1>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">Maxillectomy</a>
    (removal of parts of the upper jaw) with orbital
    exenteration (removal of the eye ball and other soft
    tissues in the eye socket) in tumour surgery can create
    a complex combination defect which requires a
    combination of <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/detailed">reconstructive
        flap techniques</a> and rehabilitation with
    craniofacial implants and prosthesis (Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-implants-level2-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The complex issue
        of multiple missing tissues and irreplaceable
        structures (such as the eye) can be partly
        alleviated by combining free-flap reconstructive
        surgery with craniofacial implants and a masking
        prosthesis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Again, the prosthesis is held by craniofacial implants
    with magnetic attachments. Depending on the type and
    size of the defect, finding suitable anchor points for
    prosthesis can be a challenge. In this case, the upper
    implants are inserted into the intact supraorbital
    (upper) ridge and the lower implants are inserted into a
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/detailed">microvascular
        bony flap</a> (Figure 7).</p>

</figure>
<p>Following the creation of models and fitting and
    colouring the prosthesis, the final result (Figure 8)
    has high aesthetic standards because these body
    replacement parts can be fabricated to extremely high
    standards in the laboratory.</p>

<h1 id="rehabilitation-/-repair-after-orbital-eye-socket-fracture">Rehabilitation / repair after orbital (eye socket)
    fracture</h1>
<p>Some consider titanium implants used in the <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed">repair
        of orbital fractures</a> a form of craniofacial
    implants.</p>
<p>After a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scan</a>
    the healthy orbit is mirrored to the fractured one. The
    mirrored orbital floor is used as guide for a custom
    made craniofacial implant. The implant is designed on
    the computer and then 3D printed in titanium. The
    implant is inserted to the orbital floor and fixed with
    screws to the lower orbital rim (Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-implants-level2-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> A custom-made
        titanium implant inserted to reconstruct the
        fractured orbital floor. The implant is retained
        with screws in the lower orbital rim.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The aim is to nearly normalise the orbital volume and
    remove adhesions to the fracture which can <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">cause
        double vision</a> by impacting the optic nerve.
    Clinical evaluation of eye movement and vision is used
    to assess the outcome and a CT scan is performed to
    assess the fit of the implant (Figure 10).</p>

        CT scan illustrating the position of the custom-made

<h1 id="prosthetic-rehabilitation-of-a-large-skull-defect">Prosthetic rehabilitation of a large skull defect</h1>
<p>A further variant of craniofacial implants are implants
    to reconstruct the skull. Cranioplasty with both acrylic
    and titanium implants are very common after
    neurosurgical procedures where the skull has been lost,
    such as after <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed">severe
        trauma</a>.</p>
<p>In cases of elective resection of the skull, for example
    in tumour surgery, a combination of resection guides and
    customised cranial implants can be helpful (Figure 11).
</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> A pre-planned
        resection guide to optimize retention of healthy
        skull bone as much as possible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The removal of the affected part of the skull is planned
    based on a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT
        scan</a>. To aid precise excision while minimising
    unnecessary bone loss, a resection guide is 3D printed
    from the high-resolution CT data. After resection along
    the resection guide, an implant exactly fitting into the
    defect is placed to protect the brain (Figure 12).</p>

        placed in the defect of the skull and fixed by
        screws.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the end of surgery, the skull implant has to be
    covered by a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/detailed">soft
        tissue flap</a> to protect the implant from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">infection</a>.
    Here the soft tissue coverage is provided by an
    anterolateral thigh free flap (Figure13).</p>
