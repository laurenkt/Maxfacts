<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the thyroid (gland
    in the neck) include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the residual function of the gland is too high or too
        low, this has to be balanced by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/thyroid">medication</a>.</li>
    <li>Postoperative bleeding can compress the underlying windpipe
        by formation of a haematoma. This needs to be decompressed
        immediately, usually by removing skin staples or a rapid
        to remove ‘pull through’ suture.  </li>
    <li>Accidental damage to, or removal of the underlying parathyroid
        glands necessitates life-long <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/pth">substitution of parathyroid hormone (PTH)</a>.</li>
    <li>Damage to the recurrent <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">laryngeal nerve</a>        leaving a hoarse voice, can be improved by <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapy</a>        or else should be seen in an ear, nose and throat (ENT)
        clinic.</li>
    <li>Minor difficulties in swallowing are best dealt with in line
        with treatment of postoperative problems affecting the
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/hypopharynx">hypopharynx</a>        and/or <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/larynx">larynx</a>.</li>
</ul>
