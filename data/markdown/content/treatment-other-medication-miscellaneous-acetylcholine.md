<p>Acetylcholine is a small molecule (Figure 1) that has many different
    functions as a neurotransmitter (a messenger molecule for
    the functioning of the nervous system and numerous actions
    of the body triggered by nervous impulses to other cells,
    including muscle and gland cells, and neurons) in all areas
    of the body. In the body, acetylcholine is synthesised in
    certain neurons (so called cholinergic neurons) by the enzyme
    choline acetyltransferase from choline and acetyl coenzyme
    A. It is stored in vesicles in cholinergic neurons and released
    into the synapse by a nerve impulse. Free acetylcholine in
    the body is rapidly deactivated by the action of the enzyme
    acetyl cholinesterase.</p>

<p>Acetylcholine itself is not a medication. However, a large number
    of medications and other drugs interfere in some way with
    the synthesis, release and/or function of acetylcholine.
    Given the ubiquitous role of acetylcholine, such agents then
    carry a potential burden of significant and wide-ranging
    adverse effects from blocking, mimicking or enhancing the
    physiological effects of acetylcholine. The only exception
    where acetylcholine in low dose is actually used as a local
    medication, is in ophthalmology where in cataract surgery
    acetylcholine eye drops are used.</p>
<p>One place where acetylcholine acts is at the neuromuscular junctions
    of the peripheral nervous system. It is released into the
    synapses between motor neurons and muscle cells. Release
    of acetylcholine activates muscular contractions in the skeletal
    muscles and this enables motion. Acetylcholine also acts
    in the autonomic nervous system, with effects on numerous
    involuntary and unconscious functions of internal organs.
    Acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter in both branches
    of the autonomic nervous system, in the sympathetic and the
    parasympathetic nervous system, with different effects. The
    sympathetic nervous system uses acetylcholine to cause the
    release of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/adrenaline">noradrenaline</a>,
    which activates adrenergic receptors on target tissues. The
    parasympathetic nervous system uses acetylcholine to mediate
    the increasing or slowing of heart rate among other effects.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is involved in the regulation of the contraction
    of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal system (increasing
    peristalsis) and in the urinary tract, it has effects on
    the respiratory system, activates the secretions of all glands
    that are connected with the parasympathetic nervous system,
    in the central nervous system it aids memory and learning,
    and has wide-ranging effects on the cardiovascular system
    where it acts as a <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-vasoconstrictor-and-vasodilator">vasodilator</a>    and down-regulates heart beat rate and contraction of the
    heart muscle. The acetylcholine receptors in the brain are
    associated with <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">nicotine addiction</a>:
    nicotine binds to this type of acetylcholine receptor and
    acts as an acetylcholine agonist.</p>
<p>Accordingly, any drugs that interfere with this neurotransmitter
    system can have drastic and dangerous effects, ranging from
    paralysis to convulsions. Many toxins in nature, produced
    by plants, animals or microbes, act on the cholinergic system,
    an example being <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/botulinum">botulinum toxin</a>    causing paralysis. Some medicinal drugs, in particular some
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>    such as clindamycin, some <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/anticonvulsant">anticonvulsants</a>    and some diuretics, reduce the release of acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Some agents act by inhibiting cholinesterase and thus increase
    the levels of acetylcholine. High doses of cholinesterase
    inhibitors can cause fatal convulsions. Examples of cholinesterase
    inhibitors are nerve agents (Sarin) or some pesticides (organophosphates).
    More benign clinical uses of cholinesterase inhibitors in
    low doses include the reversal of the action of muscle relaxants,
    the improvement of muscle activity in some gastrointestinal
    conditions and the treatment of the <a href="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2 ">autoimmune condition</a>    myasthenia gravis (where antibodies inhibit the functioning
    of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions by destroying
    the receptors involved). Some symptoms of Alzheimerâ€™s disease
    may be reduced by cholinesterase inhibitors.</p>
