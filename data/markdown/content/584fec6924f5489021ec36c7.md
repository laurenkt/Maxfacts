<p>Cell growth is controlled via various mechanisms involving DNA
    and a variety of proteins. Healthy adult cells do not normally
    replicate extensively. However, mutations can lead to uncontrolled
    cell propagation and therefore growth of tumours. Chemotherapy
    drugs generally aim to kill malignant cells by targeting
    the molecules and mechanisms involved in cell division.</p>
<p>This is not to say only malignant cells are affected by chemotherapy;
    the substances used are intrinsically cytotoxic (toxic to
    living cells). Hair growth, maintenance of mucosa and blood
    cell production are processes in which healthy cells are
    also constantly dividing fairly rapidly and so are also affected
    by chemotherapy. Consequently side effects, such as hair
    loss, mouth ulcers or anaemia, can occur.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows a sketch of two drug molecules commonly used in
    chemotherapy: cisplatin and carboplatin. Both are drugs that
    target genetic material in a living cell.</p>

        of cisplatin (left) and carboplatin (right).</figcaption>

<p>Cisplatin and carboplatin belong to the class of DNA crosslinking
    chemotherapy agents. They bond to DNA and in this way prohibit
    further cell division, and thus induce cell death (apoptosis).
    This mechanism, identical for cisplatin and carboplatin,
    is shown in Figure 2. Carboplatin is used in cases when cisplatin
    is not appropriate, such as where kidney function is impaired
    in a patient as carboplatin is slightly less nephrotoxic
    (harmful to the kidney) than cisplatin.</p>

<p>Methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil are chemotherapy drugs that belong
    to the class of drugs known as antimetabolites. By closely
    mimicking molecules that are ordinarily consumed by the normal
    healthy cell cycle, these substances prevent the cycle from
    continuing and so induce apoptosis. Antimetabolites typically
    differ only very slightly in their molecular composition
    and structure from the molecules ordinarily used by the cell
    (see Figure 3). Yet these minute differences are enough to
    prevent normal cell function. As can be seen in Figure 3,
    the normal natural substrate uracil (left) differs from the
    chemotherapy drug molecule 5-fluorouracil (right) by just
    having replaced one H atom by a fluorine atom. Uracil is
    one of the four building blocks of RNA.</p>

<p>Some chemotherapy drugs interact with various specific proteins
    to inhibit cell processes involved in replication. Epidermal
    growth factor receptors (EGFR) regulate cell-signalling pathways,
    which are responsible for cellular propagation. When mutated
    this receptor can often be overactive. Cetuximab is a drug
    that inhibits the action of this protein and consequently
    suppresses cell proliferation. It is the only such drug currently
    used in head and neck cancer treatments.</p>
<p>Taxanes are a class of chemotherapy drugs that inhibit the function
    of microtubules (units that maintain the structure of cells
    and help with the assembly of new cells) in mitosis (the
    late stage of cell division where a new cell nucleus is formed)
    therefore preventing the successful completion of cell division.</p>
<p>Only limited roles have been identified for these two substances
    in the context of head and neck cancer.</p>
