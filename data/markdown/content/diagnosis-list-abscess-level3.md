<p>The following conditions are effectively an extension of the
    pathological process initiated by the “simple” dental abscess.
    This information is worth considering in relation to the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">other maxillofacial infections</a>.</p>
<h1 id="cervicofacial-abscess">Cervicofacial abscess</h1>
<p>A far more substantial problem than a “simple” dental abscess
    as here the infection has tracked through the fascial spaces
    of the neck and collected in particular areas. A cervicofacial
    abscess may develop from dental decay, from a dental abscess
    or from jaw injury.</p>
<h1 id="ludwigs-angina">Ludwig’s angina</h1>
<p>This is a dangerous condition in which there is bilateral involvement
    of the sublingual and submandibular spaces. This results
    in elevation of the floor of the mouth and tongue and marked
    oedema of the soft tissues of the neck. Ludwig’s angina is
    most commonly the consequence of dental sepsis but may complicate
    submandibular gland infection, infection of a mandibular
    fracture or of an intraoral wound. There is marked systemic
    upset and hard swelling of the neck and floor of mouth. Inability
    to swallow ones own saliva is a major indicator of deterioration.
    The airway is at definite risk. A variety of oral commensal
    bacteria have been implicated.</p>
<h1 id="necrotising-fasciitis">Necrotising fasciitis</h1>
<p>This is an uncommon, but life-threatening condition, which may
    affect the head and neck and be rapidly fulminant. The mortality
    approaches 40%. The term necrotising soft tissue infection
    is preferred by some. This is because it is felt that this
    more accurately reflects the process as the fascial boundaries
    are frequently transgressed by the infection. It also overcomes
    arguments about whether or not there are involved “deep fascial
    components” in the face as in reality it is more frequently
    a necrosis of muscle, fat and skin in the head and neck,
    with necrotic muscle causing the classical undermining skin
    infection and necrosis.</p>
<p>It is frequently a polymicrobial infection, with group A streptococci
    most commonly isolated (s. Milleri is frequently found).
    It is felt to be more common in patients with some form of
    immunocompromise. The initial site of infection may be so
    trivial as to be unnoticed by the patient. The subsequent
    systemic upset and tissue destruction is disproportionate
    to the initial infection. The soft tissue destruction is
    characterised by liquefaction of the subcutaneous fat and
    connective tissue. Small vessel thrombosis gives rise to
    a mottled appearance of the affected skin. A rapidly progressive
    systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with multiorgan
    failure is frequent.</p>
