<p>Once a biopsy is taken in an outpatient setting or in operating
    theatre, the specimen must be examined by a trained histopathologist
    (in this context, histology is the process of examining a
    human tissue specimen; veterinary surgeons and anthropologists
    also use histopathology techniques). Before it can be examined
    under a microscope, the specimen must be prepared. This preparation
    usually follows a typical, standardised general process through
    the laboratory with many of the steps done as an automated
    batch process by machines, improving efficiency. Figure 1
    outlines the numerous, almost algorithmic steps necessary
    to get a typical biopsy specimen ready for examination. Below
    we describe this process step by step. This journey through
    the laboratory is for typical cases of mostly soft tissue
    samples. Some samples, such as frozen sections and cytology
    specimens (examination of individual cells in biopsy specimen)
    such as samples obtained by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">fine needle aspiration biopsies</a>,
    are processed slightly differently and are discussed separately.</p>

        prepare a biopsy specimen for microscopic examination.</figcaption>

<h1 id="the-biopsy-sample-on-the-way-to-the-laboratory">The biopsy sample on the way to the laboratory</h1>
<p>The course of action before sending the biopsy specimen on its
    way to the laboratory depends on the kind of biopsy taken.
    That is whether a diagnostic incision or core biopsy, a cellular
    sample (by aspiration with a needle), or a therapeutic excision
    biopsy were taken.</p>
<p>A core biopsy and a liquid / cellular sample collected with a
    needle cannot be orientated. The specimen is placed directly
    into the transport or fixation medium (see below) and transported
    to the laboratory.</p>
<p>For an incision biopsy, knowing the orientation of the specimen
    and sharing this information with the pathologist is important.
    Defining orientation of the specimen is usually achieved
    by placing at least two marker stitches on the sample, and
    relating this to a drawing of the specimen, and where it
    came from.</p>
<p>For an excision biopsy, knowing the orientation of the specimen
    and sharing this information with the pathologist is essential.
    In some cases this can be achieved in similar ways as for
    incision biopsies. Some complex specimens can be oriented
    by suturing to a diagram board (this is used in <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">neck dissection</a>    and is especially important if no real anatomical landmarks
    are available in the specimen). Some surgeons cut the specimen
    in theatre themselves and use marker stitches and diagrams
    at each level to orientate the specimen. This, plus the written
    information sent along, is the only routine means a surgeon
    has to communicate with the pathologist. As this information
    is essential, this process should not be delegated to anyone
    not capable of understanding and acting on the information.</p>
<h1 id="the-biopsy-sample-in-the-laboratory-cutting-the-specimen-and-preparing-sections-for-slicing-thinly">The biopsy sample in the laboratory: cutting the specimen and
    preparing sections for slicing thinly</h1>
<p>When the specimen arrives at the laboratory (Figure 2), it may
    or may not be in a fixative already. If it is not in a fixative,
    it will be in a buffer solution (a solution that stops the
    specimen from becoming more acidic or more alkaline, preserving
    the state the specimen was in when it was taken) and needs
    to be moved into a fixative. Fixatives are chemical solutions
    that preserve the structure and cells of the specimen by
    hardening the tissue and inactivating the enzymes, so preventing
    the tissue from degrading. The most common fixative is formaldehyde,
    often in a buffered solution referred to as formalin, although
    others such as ethanol are also used.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Typical biopsy samples of brain
        tissue as they arrive in the histopathology laboratory,
        immersed in fixative.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A macroscopic evaluation of the specimen is carried out to note
    the appearance before processing occurs. The specimen is
    trimmed at this stage and needs to provide sections that
    are representative of the whole specimen (Figure 3). This
    is sometimes done by the surgeon in theatre (see above).
    These sections will need to be cut again before they can
    be examined with a microscope. To prevent tissue damage caused
    by cutting, the specimen must be hardened further before
    cutting it.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A biopsy sample of brain tissue,
        cut up before further processing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the specimen has been in the fixative, it must be prepared
    for embedding in wax so it can be cut. The specimen contains
    water, as the human body is made up of approximately 50 to
    60 % water, however wax is not soluble in water. The water
    must therefore be removed from the specimen and replaced
    with a solvent that wax is soluble in. The specimen is transferred
    through a series of baths with water-alcohol mixtures with
    increasing concentrations of alcohol (Table 1; Figure 4).
    This dilutes and eventually (at absolute alcohol level) replaces
    the water in the specimen. The absolute alcohol is replaced
    several times to ensure it is not contaminated and that all
    water is replaced. Delicate specimens are transferred through
    more concentrations of alcohol (Table 1) to minimise tissue
    distortion.</p>

<p>Using series of baths with increasing alcohol concentrations
    minimises tissue distortion by gently reducing the tissue
    water content in a stepwise manner. This prevents artefacts
    in the final sample preparation. Specimens may be agitated
    (shaken) whilst they are being dehydrated to speed up the
    process.</p>
<p>The tissue must be ‘cleared’ before it can be embedded in wax.
    This is done by placing the specimen in an organic solvent
    such as xylene or toluene, known as a clearing agent (as
    the specimen often looks completely clear when immersed in
    the clearing agent), which replaces the alcohol in the specimen.
    The specimen is then placed in warm wax, most often paraffin
    wax, in a mould (Figure 5). The wax is soluble in the clearing
    agents allowing it to permeate the specimen. When it cools,
    the wax hardens, allowing the specimen to be cut into thin
    slices. If electron microscopy is going to be needed, synthetic
    resin must be the embedding medium. Resin is much harder
    than wax, allowing very thin sections to be cut which are
    needed for electron microscopy.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Equipment (top) and sample holders
        (bottom left) used for embedding biopsy specimens in
        wax (bottom right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whilst soft specimens must be hardened before cutting, hard specimens,
    such as bone or tooth samples, are too hard to cut. They
    must be softened after they are fixed but before they are
    dehydrated, cleared and embedded. This is done by removing
    some / most of the inorganic salts in these hard tissues
    (demineralisation). Exactly which inorganic components need
    to be removed depends of the type of specimen and its composition.
    Any fixative needs to be removed before demineralisation
    to avoid chemical reactions between the various chemicals.
    Bone and tooth specimens are calcified (contain calcium ions).
    These calcium salts make them hard. They are softened in
    a process called decalcification, by dissolution of the calcium
    salts. This process mostly relies on treating the specimen
    with suitable acids or with chelating agents (chemical compounds
    with a particular ability to bond with calcium ions).</p>
<p>Once the specimen is suitably softened, it needs to be dehydrated,
    cleared and embedded. Embedding media for hard tissue samples,
    such as bone and teeth, are different from those used for
    soft tissues. Nitrocellulose and low-viscosity nitrocellulose
    are often used to embed hard tissues. These cellulose derivatives
    provide better support for cutting hard specimens. Also,
    there is less shrinkage and distortion than with paraffin
    wax, although in principle wax can be used to embed decalcified
    specimens. Nitrocellulose can make the cutting process more
    difficult because these samples normally need to be cut wet,
    and the cutting is slower than for wax embedded samples.
    Sometimes a double embedding of nitrocellulose and paraffin
    wax is used to make cutting the sample easier.</p>
<p>Cutting is done by a knife called a microtome (a precision mechanical
    instrument that is used to cut specimens into very thin uniform
    sections / slices; Figure 6). For examination of the sample
    by light microscopy, the thickness of the sections can vary
    between 1 and 10 µm, whereas for electron microscopy, the
    thickness of the sections must be around 0.01 µm, an ultra-thin
    section.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> A rotary microtome used for cutting

        view; bottom: series of thin sections as they are produced
        by the microtome.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are many different types of microtomes, with the two basic
    types of microtome employing rotary (Figure 6) and sliding
    (Figure 7) cutting mechanisms, respectively. These standard
    microtomes are used to cut semi-thin to thin sections from
    paraffin wax-embedded and resin-embedded specimens for light
    microscopy. The sliding microtome was originally designed
    for cutting celloidin-embedded sections of mostly hard tissue
    samples.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Demonstration of the working of
        a simple bench-top microtome with a sliding cutting mechanism.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In a rotary microtome, the knife is fixed in place and the specimen
    is moved towards and away from the fixed knife. In a sliding
    microtome, the knife moves and the specimen is fixed. Rotary
    and sliding microtomes are often not suitable for cutting
    harder tissues, particularly bone if it is undecalcified.
    Undecalcified bone is cut with a saw microtome, which has
    a diamond coated fast-rotating blade. Bone cannot be cut
    into thin sections using this method. The ultra-thin sections
    required for electron microscopy are cut using an ultra-microtome,
    which has a knife made from glass or diamond.</p>
<p>Once the sections have been cut, they are either floated in a
    water bath (Figure 8) until they are needed or are put directly
    onto a glass slide. The ‘parked’ floating sections later
    also need to be put onto a glass slide before further processing.</p>

    plates and staining them</h1>
<p>The cut wax sections are laid onto glass microscope slides (Figure
    9). This literally involves fishing out, with a glass slide,
    from the water bath the floating thin sections.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Thin section positioned on a glass
        slide.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this pristine condition, the cellular structures are not easily
    visible in detail under a microscope, so the specimen needs
    to be stained. The stains that are used are all aqueous solutions,
    meaning that now the wax needs to be dissolved and the specimen
    rehydrated (the wax replaced with water) for the stain to
    be able to penetrate the specimen. A clearing agent is used
    to replace the wax and then the specimen is submerged in
    a series of baths with decreasing concentrations of alcohol
    ending at 0 % alcohol concentration, pure water. This is
    the reverse of the previous dehydration steps.</p>
<p>Once rehydrated, the most common method of staining is called
    <strong>haematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E)</strong> but there
    are hundreds of more specific stains and dyes. Haematoxylin
    and eosin use acid - base chemical reactions to stain specimens.
    Acidic compounds form an ion that has a positive charge (H<sup>+</sup>),
    leaving the molecule with an overall negative charge. Basic
    compounds form an ion that has a negative charge (OH<sup>-</sup>),
    leaving the molecule with an overall positive charge. Positively
    and negatively charged molecules tend to react with each
    other in a neutralisation reaction. Acidic and basic compounds
    can be classified using acid - base indicators such as the
    universal indicator. The universal indicator changes colour
    when probing a compound, based on how acidic or basic it
    is (Figure 10).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Universal indicator colour scale
        for acidic and basic (alkaline) compounds.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Haematoxylin and eosin molecules have a chromophore bound to
    the acidic or basic region in the molecules, respectively.
    A chromophore is a functional group in a molecule that is
    responsible for the colour of the compound, and this is how
    the stains produce colouring of biopsy specimen, after binding
    to specific types of cell components.</p>
<p>Haematoxylin can only be used as a dye in its oxidised form,
    haematein (Figure 11). It is a basic dye, which binds to
    acidic structures within the specimen, such as the nucleus
    of the cell, DNA or RNA (genetic material) or cartilage,
    staining them a purple or blue colour.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure11.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> The molecular structures of haematoxylin
        and haematein.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Eosin is a negatively charged acidic dye, which binds to basic
    components within the specimen, such as proteins, staining
    them a red or pink colour. There are two different types
    of eosin, eosin Y and eosin B. Eosin Y is the most commonly
    used type (Figure 12).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure12.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> The molecular structure of eosin
        (X = Br: eosin Y, X = NO2: eosin B).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Specimens are stained first with the oxidised form of haematoxylin,
    haematein, then washed, stained with eosin and then washed
    again. The two types of stains are complementary and when
    used together, highlight all the most important cell structures
    in easily distinguishable bright colours (Figure 13).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> A range of different H &amp;
        E stained tissue samples.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>More specific stains can be used to visualise specific cell-surface
    proteins or disease-specific characteristics. Examples of
    more specific staining procedures are antibody or fluorescent
    staining (see below). Over the past decade such specific
    stains have become more widely used.</p>
<p><strong>Fluorescent staining</strong> is most commonly used in
    fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridisation (FISH), which uses
    fluorescent probes (fluorophores) that bind to complementary
    sequences of DNA or RNA. Fluorescence is the visible (or
    invisible, to the eye) light given off by some chemical compounds
    when irradiated with UV light. Such chemical compounds are
    typically organic molecules with a flat molecular structure
    and a resulting delocalised electronic structure within the
    molecules.</p>
<p>Staining a sample with a fluorescent probe allows locating and
    quantifying those structures in the specimen that the fluorescent
    probe bonded to, typically some target sequences in DNA or
    RNA looking for highly specific information. This is done
    by using fluorescently labelled strands (probes) of DNA or
    RNA, which are complimentary (and so will bind to) to a target
    sequence in the DNA or RNA of the specimen (Figure 14).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure14.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 14:</strong> The working principle of fluorescent
        staining.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The fluorescent probes are applied to the specimen and then the
    specimen is washed to remove any of the unbound probe. Only
    probes that have bonded to the complimentary target sequence
    will be left on the specimen, so any fluorescence shows the
    location and number of there complementary target sequences.
    An example of an application for this staining technique
    is the identification of a range of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">bacterial infections</a>,
    identifying specific DNA/RNA sequences of the infecting agent(s).</p>
<p><strong>Immunohistochemistry</strong> uses <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">antibodies</a>    that are specific to certain cell-surface proteins. Immunohistochemistry
    is based on the affinity between antigens and antibodies.
    Antigens can be present on cell surfaces, in cells or on
    proteins, and have a specific shape. A diagnostic antibody,
    which is complimentary to the shape of a target antigen (like
    a key is complimentary to the shape of a lock), can be introduced
    and, if the target antigen is present, will form an antigen-antibody
    complex (Figure 15).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure15.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 15:</strong> Antigen - antibody complex.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Often, an indirect technique is used for visualisation. This
    involves using two antibodies. The first (primary) antibody
    recognises the specific antigen of interest in the specimen,
    and the second (secondary) antibody recognises the primary
    antibody. The secondary antibody is most often labelled with
    horseradish peroxidase which turns brown upon binding to
    the primary antibody (Figure 16). A counterstain is sometimes
    used to provide contrast, helping the primary stain to stand
    out. The complex formation can be visualised by a colour
    reaction on the slide.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure16.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 16:</strong> Indirect immunohistochemistry
        – working principle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fixing, dehydration and wax embedding can destroy or mask antigens,
    which means antibody staining may not always work. There
    are ways to ‘unmask’ the antigens from some specimens, such
    as using microwave ovens or pressure cookers.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry can be combined with fluorescent staining,
    in a process called immunofluorescence, with two main methods
    used. Direct immunofluorescence uses one fluorescently labelled
    antibody to bind to its target sequence (Figure 17).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure17.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 17:</strong> Direct immunofluorescence.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Indirect immunofluorescence is similar to the indirect technique
    for immunohistochemistry (see above). It uses two antibodies
    where the first antibody binds to the antigen target and
    the second antibody binds to the first antibody. In this
    method, the secondary antibody is fluorescently labelled
    instead of being labelled with horseradish peroxidase (Figure
    18).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure18.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 18:</strong> Indirect immunofluorescence.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Generally, once all the preparation steps have been carried out
    and staining is complete, the specimen must be dehydrated
    again. This follows the same approach as in the first dehydration
    step when preparing the specimen to be embedded in wax for
    cutting. Now the specimen is embedded in a mounting medium
    (a solution that stabilises the specimen and which does not
    affect the staining of the specimen and also helps to keep
    the coverslip in place). The mounting medium must be soluble
    in the organic solvent used to clear the specimen. The choice
    of mounting medium will vary depending on whether it is a
    hard or soft tissue sample. The choice includes resins (synthetic,
    semi-synthetic or natural), glycerol gel or fructose syrup.
    The specimen in the mounting medium on the microscope slide
    is finally covered by a thin glass coverslip to protect and
    preserve it.</p>
<h1 id="the-biopsy-sample-under-the-microscope">The biopsy sample under the microscope</h1>
<p>Once the specimen has been stained, dehydrated, cleared and mounted,
    it is ready to be inspected with a microscope. The type of
    microscope depends upon the type of staining used on the
    sample and the detail and type of information needed.</p>
<p>The general choice of microscope is the <strong>light microscope</strong>    where visible light is focused on the sample, which is observed
    through an eyepiece. Different magnifications can be achieved
    depending on the magnifications of the eyepiece lens and
    the objective lens, with the magnifications being multiplied
    together to give the overall magnification. This can be used
    to visualise most specimens, including those with haematoxylin
    and eosin staining and antibody staining with horseradish
    peroxidase (Figure 19). A light microscope is not suitable
    to examine fluorescent staining or very small structures
    within the specimen. The best resolution a light microscope
    can achieve is approximately 0.2 µm. As cells tend to be
    about 20 to 40 µm in diameter, these can be seen easily using
    a light microscope. Structures within cells, which are smaller
    than 0.2 µm, cannot be seen however.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure19.jpg">

        under a light microscope. Image courtesy of L. Baxter,
        Sheffield.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To be able to investigate structures smaller than 0.2 µm, an
    <strong>electron microscope</strong> is used. This uses a
    beam of electrons, instead of a (visible to the eye) light
    source. The electron beam has a much shorter wavelength than
    visible light, allowing for increased resolution. The resolution
    of a standard electron microscope is about 1 to 2 nm (equivalent
    to 0.001 to 0.002 µm). Much finer structural detail can be
    seen by electron microscopy than by light microscopy.</p>
<p>When fluorescent staining is used, a <strong>fluorescence</strong>    or <strong>confocal microscope</strong> is needed for examination
    of the stained structures. Fluorophores absorb light at a
    specific wavelength and re-emit light at a different (usually
    longer) wavelength. This is a similar principle to how objects
    are seen as a specific colour in the visible range of light.
    Objects appear as the colour of the wavelength of light they
    do not absorb (Figure 20).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure20.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 20:</strong> Wavelengths of visible light.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, a red apple absorbs light at all wavelengths except
    for the wavelength for red light, which it reflects, so appearing
    red in colour. The difference between this and fluorescence
    is that light absorbed is not in the visible region of the
    spectrum (UV light is often used) and, instead of reflecting
    light, it re-emits the light at a longer wavelength (in the
    visible light region). A fluorescence microscope uses this
    principle, using UV light to excite fluorophores within the
    specimen and causing the re-emission of light at a longer
    wavelength by the stained specimen. The microscope then uses
    an emission filter, which filters out all light except light
    at the wavelength emitted by the fluorophores, meaning only
    the emitted light from the specimen can be visualised. Due
    to this filtering, fluorescing materials appear bright (the

<p>A histopathologist examines the slides under the relevant microscope.
    Experience is a crucial ingredient in the process to identify
    structures within the specimen, to form conclusions about
    the specimen, and to suggest a diagnosis (or exclude one).
    Much of this process may be considered as pattern recognition
    by a very highly trained human eye. The results of the examination
    are summarised in a written report for the surgeon. In urgent
    cases, this is by same day internal delivery but a definitive
    report may take over a week. This is (in the UK) largely
    dependent on availability of trained pathology technicians.</p>
<p>Identification of rare entities requires specialisation by the
    histopathologist (in much the same way as surgery has become
    anatomical site specific, and even disease specific). The
    role of centralisation and international expert groups is
    relevant here and can greatly increase the time taken for
    a definitive result to come back and enable the surgeon to
    inform their patient.</p>
<h1 id="frozen-section">Frozen section</h1>
<p>When analysis of a specimen is needed rapidly, frozen sections
    are often taken. Examination of frozen sections must be pre-arranged
    with the histopathology laboratory. Once taken, the biopsy
    sample is transferred immediately to the laboratory for preparation
    and interpretation. Like with most general specimens, knowing
    the orientation of the frozen section is important and so
    this information must be conveyed with the sample. Frozen
    sections are used for solid tumour surgery where the aim
    is to resect as little healthy tissue as possible whilst
    ensuring a clear surgical margin (microscopically usually
    defined as 5 mm although this varies by site and disease).
    The frozen section specimen is used to determine if the surgical
    margin is clear or whether more tissue needs to be excised.</p>
<p>When the sample arrives in the lab, it may or may not be in a
    fixative. The sample is frozen and cut using either a freezing
    microtome or a cryostat (a microtome mounted in a freezing
    cabinet). Freezing the sample hardens it such that it can
    be sliced.</p>
<p>The freezing microtome is connected to a cylinder of carbon dioxide
    which is used to rapidly freeze the specimen. The knife of
    the freezing microtome is moved whilst the specimen remains
    static to cut sections from the frozen block. However, this
    method cannot produce very thin sections. For thin frozen
    sections, a cryostat is used. In the cryostat, a microtome
    of any type is enclosed within a deep-freeze cabinet. The
    specimen is snap frozen at a very low temperature (either
    using liquid nitrogen or isopentane cooled to -80 °C) with
    the temperature of the cryostat regulated between -10 °C
    and -30 °C and thin sections cut from the frozen specimen.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-tests-biopsy-level3-figure22.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 22:</strong> Equipment (top) and closer view
        of microtome (bottom) used to prepare frozen thin sections.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The frozen thin sections can then be applied to slides, stained,
    and mounted more rapidly than in the general method. Generally,
    staining and mounting techniques for frozen sections are
    very similar to those for normal sections.</p>
<p>Whilst frozen sections provide rapid results, they are notoriously
    inaccurate. In the process of freezing the sample, the water
    expands as it becomes ice, causing cells to burst and destroying
    tissue structures (an effect that is used in <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">cryotherapy</a>    with the intent to destroy tissue). This causes the presence
    of freezing artefacts in the sample. Also, air bubbles can
    get into the sections, which can be difficult to distinguish
    from other areas within the specimen. Staining quality can
    also be affected. Arriving at an accurate and reliable diagnosis
    can be difficult. Alternative real-time technologies for
    the in-theatre assessment of surgical margins are being explored.
    Potential alternatives include rapid evaporation <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/mass-spectrometry">mass spectroscopy</a>    or the use of <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/raman-spectroscopy">vibrational spectroscopy</a>    for rapid ‘finger printing’ of tissue samples.</p>
<h1 id="cytology">Cytology</h1>
<p>Cytology is the process of examination of individual cells of
    the body, unlike the usual method of studying human tissue
    (histology). Specimens for cytology often come from <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">fine needle aspiration biopsies</a>    or from swiping a body surface (in this case usually oral
    mucosa).</p>
<p>The method of processing cytology specimens depends on the type
    of specimen and the concentration of cells in the collected
    fluid. If there is a high concentration of cells in the fluid,
    the specimen can be smeared on a glass microscope slide directly
    and then dipped in a series of stains, similar to the ones
    used for histological samples. If there is a low concentration
    of cells in the fluid, the cells must first be concentrated
    before they are stained. The cell samples can then be examined
    under a microscope, looking for the presence of abnormal
    cells.</p>
<h1 id="common-uses-of-biopsies-in-oral-and-maxillofacial-surgery">Common uses of biopsies in oral &amp; maxillofacial surgery</h1>
<h2>Excisional biopsy</h2>
<p>This is simply the detailed examination of the margins of a resected
    diseased part of the body. If the lesion removed is benign,
    then the examination may be limited to confirming the diagnosis
    and that no part of the lesion has been left behind in the
    patient. In malignant disease not only must the disease be
    confirmed so a diagnosis and prognosis can be offered, but
    detailed examination of adequate clear margins at every point
    of a three-dimensional structure must be confirmed. Debate
    exists about what constitutes an ‘adequate safe margin’.
    In many malignancies a macroscopic margin (what the surgeon
    sees and plans and the patient loses) is around 1 cm of apparently
    healthy normal looking and feeling tissue at all points of
    the relevant anatomy. A microscopic safe margin is often
    considered to be 5 mm (after the fixation process described
    above, which always results in tissue shrinkage). Larger
    margins have in the past been seen as desirable for certain
    disease, for example <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">malignant melanoma</a>.
    Over the years the recognition that cancer is a cellular
    disease and that greater degrees of radicality did not improve
    overall survival but did reduce patients quality of life,
    has resulted in smaller accepted ‘adequate safe margins’
    and some evidence suggests as little as 2 mm microscopically
    equates to similar overall survival as 5 mm, although the
    evidence is mixed. These figures certainly represent the
    minimum safe amount of healthy normal tissue to be removed
    in continuity with a cancer. An example would be excision
    of a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">tongue cancer</a>.</p>
<h2>Incisional biopsy</h2>
<p>This is a diagnostic technique used for all lesions where uncertainty
    about the diagnosis exists. If a lesion is suspected of being
    malignant then a small area of the suspect pathology and
    normal surrounding tissue is cut out, usually in the form
    of an ellipse and the wound is closed with sutures. This
    allows orientation of the specimen for the examining pathologist
    and a diagnosis to be established. Punch biopsies may allow
    diagnosis but are harder to interpret because no normal tissue
    is seen. An example would be the incisional biopsy of a persisting
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">mouth ulcer</a>.</p>
<h2>Core needle biopsy</h2>
<p>In maxillofacial practice, there has been a long tradition of
    deriding this biopsy technique as either unnecessary (a properly
    performed incision biopsy yields more information and the
    wound can be closed) or dangerous. The latter was because
    it was believed a thick core biopsy needle carried a risk
    of seeding tumour cells. An example of this was <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-glands-summary">parotid tumour</a>    core biopsy, where it was felt that seeding a benign tumour
    could convert a benign, surgically curable lesion to a multifocal
    incurable one. More recently several studies have failed
    to demonstrate any truth to this belief and there is no doubt
    that it is far easier for the pathologist to make an accurate
    diagnosis on a core tissue sample than on a cytological sample,
    especially in highly complex tumours such as salivary gland
    tumours.</p>
<h2>Fine needle aspiration biopsy</h2>
<p>This tends to be used either where cytology is very well established
    with high sensitivity and specificity and the lesions to
    be diagnosed are common and may not have to be treated surgically
    (thyroid lumps, especially cystic swellings are a common
    example), or difficult or potentially dangerous to access
    lesions (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-glands-summary">deep lobe parotid tumours</a>    are an example). <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">Ultrasound imaging</a>    guidance often improves the diagnostic yield of fine needle
    aspiration biopsies.</p>
<h1 id="the-communication-channels-pathologist-gt-surgeon-gt-patient">The communication channels: pathologist =&gt; surgeon =&gt; patient</h1>
<p>The histopathologist conveys the information about the biopsy
    sample(s) to the surgeon. Specialisation and super-specialisation
    may mean that these individuals know each other and can easily
    pick up the phone, get immediate access and have a sensible
    conversation. However, if that is not the case the surgeon
    in informing their patient has to rely on the written word,
    the report received from the histopathologist. It is convenient
    for a histopathologist to literally describe what they see
    (‘pink and blue splotches on a purple background’) in their
    own jargon, but this will be difficult to decipher and interpret
    even for a well-informed surgeon.</p>
<p>What is actually helpful for the surgeon, is if the histopathologist
    makes an effort to ‘translate’ the description of their findings
    to a language that is clear to a surgeon. For example, what
    entity the pathologist believes the specimen to be, how it
    appears to be behaving, has all abnormal tissue been removed,
    and if so by how much, if not at which point in the specimen
    is it not, and relate that to the biopsy diagram provided.
    This is a pretty antediluvian way of communicating complex
    three-dimensional information about relatively rare and unpredictable
    disease. So one would think this aspect could be an area
    for development of more contemporary and more inclusive communication
    methods. In reality the two groups tend to work away in their
    own silos and simply do not communicate or have enough joint
    learning time together.</p>
<p>One way of trying to overcome this communication problem is the
    presence of specialist pathologists (and all other relevant
    specialists) at multidisciplinary clinical meetings. This
    helps but is, obviously, extraordinarily expensive in terms
    of specialists’ time. Some common sense approaches are needed
    here (there has been a national directive in the UK to promote
    a common sense approach in managing these multidisciplinary
    clinical meetings so that they are maximally effective).</p>
<p>In practical terms, both quality and speed of communication between
    surgeons and histopathologists are of great significance.
    For example, outpatient clinic appointments are often made
    for patients to return for suture removal and confirmation
    of a suspected diagnosis, or confirmation of complete excision.
    Typically, such specific clinics occur at weekly intervals.
    The diagnosis of cancer, for example, should be given face
    to face in a supportive environment, not over the phone by
    whoever happens to see the result. But if pathology takes
    10 days and clinics are every week - is speed more important
    than the right person and place to provide information to
    patients? What has been said about the quality of communication
    between histopathologists and surgeons, also applies to communication
    between surgeons and patients. Again, both parties have their
    roles to play in promoting good and helpful channels for
    information exchange.</p>
