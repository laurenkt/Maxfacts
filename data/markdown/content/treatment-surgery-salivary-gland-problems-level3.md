<h1 id="developmental-disorders-and-cysts">Developmental disorders and cysts</h1>
<p>Most disorders with ectopic (extra) salivary gland tissue, such
    as Stafne’s bone cavity, that do not cause clinical signs
    do not require treatment.</p>
<p>The surgical treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>    of the salivary glands, most commonly lymphoepithelial cysts
    of the parotid gland, consists of initial <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">aspiration and cytology</a>    followed by simple extracapsular dissection (removal) if
    they recur.</p>
<p>An example of a very common procedure is the excision of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">mucocele</a>,
    a type of cyst that is associated with the minor salivary
    glands.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A mucocele of the lower lip –
        the most common site. A supposed ‘mucocele’ of the upper
        lip is usually a tumour.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Similar to the surgical <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">treatment of other cysts</a>,
    also the surgical treatment of mucocele aims for the complete
    removal of the cyst. It requires adequate <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/detailed">local analgesia</a>,
    usually <i>via</i> bilateral mental nerve blocks. Excision
    is then accomplished by performing a mucosal wedge excision
    that avoids resecting the vermilion border (demarcation between
    lip and adjacent normal skin). Alternatively, the cyst itself
    can be dissected out submucosally. Most mucoceles are cured
    by mucosal wedge incision and removal of the associated damaged
    minor salivary glands. However, there is a small risk of
    recurrence.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">Ranula</a> is a mucous
    extravasation cyst at the floor of the mouth and will reform
    if the associated sublingual gland is not removed (see Figure
    2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A ranula marked out for excision
        with the associated sublingual gland. The submandibular
        duct should be preserved.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a risk for an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">altered sensation</a>    of the anterior (front) two thirds of the tongue and bleeding
    from the thin-walled veins that envelope the lingual nerve.</p>
<p>The sublingual gland lies in the anterior aspect of the floor
    of the mouth between the mucous membrane and the mylohyoid
    muscle. This gland can be difficult to approach because of
    the proximity of the anterior mandible (front of lower jaw).
    Lingual inclination of teeth (leaning toward the tongue)
    can make the lateral (side) aspect of the gland difficult
    to identify and visualise. The sublingual gland has numerous
    ducts and can open either directly into the overlying mucous
    membrane or into the terminal part of the duct of the submandibular
    gland.</p>
<p><strong>Excision of the sublingual gland</strong> is performed
    in conjunction with excision of the ranula, under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">general anaesthesia</a>.
    Haemostasis (stopping bleeding) is helped by infiltrating
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/adrenaline">adrenaline</a>    solution and meticulous <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">bipolar diathermy</a>.
    The position of the submandibular duct can be found by identifying
    its opening, and a small cuff of mucosa around the opening
    should be incised both to identify and to allow mobilisation
    of the duct (see Figure 3). This procedure retains adequate
    drainage for the submandibular gland, which does not need
    to be removed.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Submandibular duct repositioning
        with sublingual gland excision.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The intact ranula can then be dissected by a combination of scissors
    and swabs. The sublingual gland is identified as it envelopes
    the submandibular duct and is excised. The remnants of sublingual
    gland closest to the submandibular gland are often difficult
    to identify and to separate completely. It may be necessary
    to leave small remnants of sublingual gland tissue in the
    area. Obvious residual sublingual gland tissue should be
    <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">cauterised</a>    to minimise leakage of saliva. Adequate haemostasis should
    be ensured at this point because postoperative bleeding can
    be a real problem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, excision of both sublingual glands is the most common
    treatment for severe cases of <strong>drooling</strong>:
    the two sublingual glands are removed and the submandibular
    ducts are redirected so that saliva from the submandibular
    glands is emptied into the oropharynx (rather than the mouth).
    Careful preoperative assessment is required as not all patients
    may be suitable. This treatment does not usually eliminate
    the problem completely but reduces it such that it becomes
    more manageable (less frequent bib changes). Applying
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/botulinum">botulinum alpha toxin</a> directly into the submandibular
        gland can provide a temporary solution if reduction of
        <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">‘resting’ salivary</a>        flow (that is – when not eating; usually from the submandibular
        glands) is helpful. Aspiration of saliva can be a serious
        complication of severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia/more-info">dysphagia</a>.
        This problem is not helped by duct transposition of the
        submandibular gland and the old-fashioned, but effective,
        remedy of <a href="/treatment/surgery/dysphagia">bilateral sublingual and submandibular gland excision</a>        is more helpful in that case.</p>
<h1 id="obstructive-disease">Obstructive disease</h1>
<p>The ductal system of the major salivary glands may be blocked
    by calculi (stones), mucus (thick secretions) or strictures
    (narrowing or other limitations).</p>
<p>Obstructive disease, mostly affecting the ducts of the submandibular
    gland may be acute or chronic. In either case, there may
    be a swollen gland with bacterial infection, mandating treatment
    with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial medication</a>,
    typically a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">penicillin</a>,
    which is sometimes needed <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">intravenously</a>.
    An acute obstructive condition may be painful and require
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesia</a>.
    After an acute episode, removal of the calculus or the submandibular
    gland is required. It is often the case that the submandibular
    gland will have suffered irreversible damage and requires
    removal following a severe infection. Chronic obstruction
    of the submandibular gland can result in a fibrosed (irreversibly
    scarred) gland and also requires removal of the gland (see
    below).</p>
<p>The parotid gland survives acute infective episodes better than
    the submandibular gland. Removal of the obstruction in a
    parotid gland usually results in recovery of normal function.
    Typically, a sudden bad, often salty, taste in the mouth
    will be related to quite sudden relief of symptoms.</p>
<p>Calculi of the salivary glands may be dealt with in several ways.
    In the submandibular gland, if the calculus is visible in
    the duct on an <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiograph</a>    and is relatively anterior (to the front) and palpable, it
    may be removed using <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/getting-started">local anaesthesia</a>    in a procedure called transoral sialolithotomy. The area
    is infiltrated with a local <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">anaesthetic agent</a>,
    and a stay suture is placed beneath the duct proximal (near)
    to the palpable calculus (see Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Silk suture passed behind a submandibular
        duct calculus.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Traction is applied to the suture to tent up the tissues, and
    it also prevents the calculus from moving backward toward
    the gland (in fact, fibrosis around calculi and their irregular
    shape mean that they often do not move). A longitudinal incision
    is made over the calculus, thus exposing it. It can now be
    teased out of the duct. Mucosal (lining tissue) closure is
    all that is needed; stenting the duct or duct repair does
    not improve the outcome. Anterior defects should be left
    open because this produces a wider meatus (canal-like opening).
    Parotid calculi may be dealt with in a similar fashion. In
    either case the papilla (projection of the opening of the
    duct into the mouth) should not be incised as this may form
    a stricture.</p>
<p>If a calculus is very proximal in the duct at the junction of
    the duct and gland, or within the gland, removal of the gland
    is usually indicated (see below).</p>
<p>In certain cases calculi are amenable to other treatment options
    such as a basket retrieval (using a device that allows capture
    and ‘fishing’ out the calculus) or lithotripsy (a treatment
    where typically <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>    shocks are used to fragment a calculus such that it can be
    shed naturally, a well-established treatment modality in
    particular for kidney stones). Strictures may be treatable
    with balloon dilation. Sialoendoscopy and other minimally
    invasive procedures have become popular in some areas but
    have yet to gain widespread acceptance.</p>
<h1 id="infections"><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">Infections</a></h1>
<h2>Acute bacterial sialadenitis (inflammation of a salivary gland)</h2>
<p>This condition usually affects the parotid gland. Initial treatment
    involves <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>,
    rehydration and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesia</a>.
    Sialogogues (substances that promote salivary flow) such
    as simple lemon drops may be used. If an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>    has formed incision and drainage may be required. However,
    abscess formation is a rare complication, and incision and
    drainage should be avoided if possible because of inevitable
    damage to the parotid gland. This damage may create a salivary
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistula</a> which can then
    necessitate excision of the parotid gland (see below).</p>
<p>Following recovery from the acute phase a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">sialogram</a>    will be required to investigate any underlying abnormality
    and often this investigation is therapeutic due to the mechanical
    irrigation with an antiseptic (the contrast agent usually
    contains iodine).</p>
<h2>Chronic sialadenitis and submandibular gland excision</h2>
<p>This inflammatory condition tends to affect the submandibular
    glands (probably due to the more viscous secretion being
    more difficult to clear than that of the parotid gland, and
    the propensity for calculi to form in the submandibular duct).
    Chronic bacterial sialadenitis usually occurs in a gland
    that has had a history of an acute infective or obstructive
    episode.</p>
<p>Treatment is by removal of the offending gland. In the case of
    the parotid gland, a ‘total’ parotidectomy (see below) with
    facial nerve sparing and ligation of the duct will eradicate
    most cases. This involves morselisation (breaking up into
    small pieces) of the gland around the facial nerve and removal
    of the vast majority of saliva producing acini (secreting
    cells). Some surgeons attempt duct ligation alone, usually
    with some method of suppressing saliva production (for example
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/propantheline">propantheline</a>    and/or <a href="/help/non-oral-food/ng-tube">nasogastric feeding</a>).
    The hope with this method is that the gland will undergo
    atrophy (will waste away). This often makes for a very unpleasant
    initial few weeks and the overall long-term success is questionable.</p>
<p><strong>Submandibular gland excision</strong> is required after
    the gland has suffered irreparable damage from infection
    and/or obstructive disease. The surgical approach is by trans-cervical
    (from the neck) approach. The incision is two finger-breadths
    below the lower border of the mandible. A 3 to 4 cm incision
    is made. The incision is then deepened through fat that bleeds;
    bleeding needs to be controlled using <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">bipolar diathermy</a>    to expose the platysma muscle (a broad sheet of muscle covering
    front and sides of the neck; see Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Submandibular gland excision.
        The incision is two finger-breadths below the lower border
        of the mandible. After skin incision, control of bleeding
        and sweeping aside fat, the platysma muscle is exposed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Platysma is divided and the lower border of the submandibular
    gland identified, enveloped in the submandibular fascia.
    The fascia is incised and an upper flap developed. The flap
    includes submandibular fascia, platysma, fat and skin. This
    approach and adhering to the gland will preserve the function
    of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. The
    superficial pole of the gland is mobilised posteriorly (on
    the back; see Figure 6), if need be by ligating the facial
    vessels (but this is not always needed), anteriorly by counter-traction
    and inferiorly by finger dissection.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The submandibular gland lies immediately
        underneath platysma enveloped in fascia. Sticking to
        the glandular surface (in glands without <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/salivary-gland-cancer">tumour</a>)
        is a safe way to protect the marginal mandibular branch
        of the facial nerve.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The mylohyoid muscle (a pair of muscles running along the front
    of the neck from the floor of the mouth downward) is then
    retracted and the gland placed on traction. Finger dissection
    usually frees the gland up and the lingual nerve (in the
    floor of the mouth) is pulled down by counter-traction, exposing
    the submandibular ganglion (part of the involuntary nerve
    system of the head &amp; neck region) and the associated
    thin walled veins. The ganglion should undergo <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">bipolar haemostasis</a>    and then is dissected free. This allows the lingual nerve
    to spring free, and the gland will be adherent by a few fascial
    attachments and the submandibular duct. The submandibular
    duct should be traced as far forward on the floor of the
    mouth as possible, ligated and divided. Bipolar haemostasis
    is carried out, the defect has a drain placed and is closed
    in two layers.</p>
<h1 id="sjgrens-syndrome">Sjögren’s syndrome</h1>
<p>Sjögren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterised by
    a dry mouth (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>)
    and dry eyes. There is no cure for it and the management
    of Sjögren’s syndrome is largely directed toward symptom
    control. Involvement of a rheumatologist and ophthalmologist
    will often be required. There are some tried and tested strategies
    to find relief of the symptoms of <a href="/treatment/surgery/xerostomia/more-info">xerostomia</a>    but not all of these work for everybody.</p>
<p>The decreased salivary flow increases the risk of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">caries</a>    and mandates meticulous <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>,
    regular dental attendance and fluoride supplements. All patients
    with xerostomia are at higher risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">oral fungal infection</a>,
    candidiasis. This tends to exacerbate the discomfort and
    should be treated aggressively (often a higher dose of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">fluconazole</a> than normal, possibly with additional
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">miconazole</a> in recalcitrant cases as there will be
            a small number of cases of fluconazole-resistant
            <i>candida</i>). The lack of tears is treated with
            methylcellulose eye drops. An increased risk of
            <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">lymphoma</a> formation should be borne in mind, especially
                if a lump develops in the parotid glands.</p>
<h1 id="salivary-neoplasms--benign-tumours">Salivary neoplasms – benign tumours</h1>
<p>There is a huge and bewildering range of salivary neoplasms as
    described at length in the section dealing with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">diagnoses of salivary gland conditions</a>.
    The most common of these neoplasms, pleomorphic salivary
    adenoma, in the majority of cases occurs in the parotid gland,
    and there it usually occurs in the superficial lobe of the
    gland. Although benign, the pleomorphic salivary adenoma
    is poorly encapsulated and requires excision with a small
    margin of normal tissue.</p>
<p>Therefore, superficial or total conservative parotidectomy (see
    below) has been the standard of care for many years. More
    recently the use of magnification and the technique of ‘extracapsular
    dissection’ has become popular at the ultraconservative end
    of surgical treatment strategies. A more common approach
    is the selective superficial parotidectomy, where only the
    branches of the facial nerve above and below the tumour are
    dissected. A segment of tumour and normal parotid is excised
    under direct visual control of the facial nerve and a greater
    or smaller portion of normal gland is left in place. There
    can be significant mucus-filled cystic areas to these tumours
    and these must be handled carefully at surgery as any spillage
    can produce recurrence. Recurrence of pleomorphic salivary
    adenoma is often multifocal and very difficult to treat,
    with options ranging from total parotidectomy with <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    to isolated removal of recurrence, depending on individual
    circumstance.</p>
<p>Another location where salivary gland pleomorphic adenoma may
    occur is in the palate area, most often at the junction of
    hard and soft palates (see Figure 7).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Palatal pleomorphic adenoma arising
        at a typical site.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Excision of palatal pleomorphic
        adenoma by using a cleft palate gag to aid access. Subperiosteal
        stripping provides an adequate margin and heals well
        by allowing simple granulation to occur.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For all tumours which overlay the hard palate, simple subperiosteal
    excision with a mucosal margin is adequate (see Figure 8).
    Healing by secondary intention (leaving the wound as is)
    of the palate is excellent and can be achieved by using a
    dressing plate with a sedative and soothing dressing. If
    the tumour extends into the soft palate, the capsule of the
    tumour can be elevated from the underlying levator aponeurosis
    (a thin structure that connects the levator muscle (the muscle
    responsible for lifting up the soft palate when saying ‘ahhh’)
    . The soft palate defect will granulate with good functional
    result. If the levator aponeurosis is breached, however,
    this has to be repaired and should be reconstituted with
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">vascularised tissue</a>,
    such as a buccal fat pad flap, or a temporoparietal fascial
    flap.</p>
<h1 id="parotidectomy">Parotidectomy</h1>
<p>There are different versions of parotidectomy, the removal of
    the parotid gland (or parts of it). Parotidectomy is divided
    into extracapsular dissection, (so called) superficial parotidectomy,
    deep lobe parotidectomy, total facial nerve preserving parotidectomy,
    and radical parotidectomy in which the facial nerve is sacrificed.
    Any facial nerve-preserving parotidectomy is basically a
    dissection of the facial nerve.</p>
<p>The vast majority of parotidectomies are approached via a cervical
    (neck) mastoid (bone behind the earlobe) facial incision,
    starting in the preauricular sulcus (groove in front of the
    ear), looping underneath the earlobe around the mastoid and
    down into a neck skin crease. A skin flap is raised over
    the parotid fascia and the skin overlying the sternomastoid;
    this is elevated forward on a very similar plane to a
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">cutaneous face lift</a>. The parotid fascia is identified,
        the great auricular nerve is identified and the posterior
        branch preserved where at all possible (see Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Parotidectomy – raising the skin
        flap. The greater auricular nerve and sometimes the external
        jugular vein are anatomical guides to the correct thickness
        of the skin flap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The groove between the parotid gland and the sternomastoid muscle
    (long muscle in the neck from behind the ear to where the
    right and left collarbones meet) is developed to identify
    the posterior belly of the digastric muscle (pair of muscles
    under the jaw, involved in jaw movement) as shown in Figure
    10.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> The posterior belly of the digastric
        muscle is the anatomical marker for the depth of the
        facial nerve trunk in parotidectomy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is the depth at which the facial nerve will be found. The
    preauricular incision is deepened in a relatively avascular
    (few blood vessels) plane between the auricular (ear) cartilage
    and the parotid gland. This leads down to the inferior portion
    of the cartilaginous canal of the external auditory meatus
    that points in the general direction of the facial nerve,
    1 cm deep and inferior to its tip. The facial nerve will
    lie in the area indicated by the so called cartilaginous
    pointer at the depth of the posterior belly of the digastric
    muscle (see Figure 11).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> The cartilaginous ‘pointer’ indicates
        the location of the facial nerve trunk at the depth of
        the posterior belly of the digastric muscle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The remaining attached parotid gland can therefore be proceeded
    through quite quickly.</p>
<p>A further method to localise the facial nerve is to identify
    the groove between the cartilaginous and bony external auditory
    meatus because its sharp lateral edge of bone will be felt.
    It lies immediately superficial and superior to the nerve
    at its point of exit from the skull, and it is a good fall-back
    position if the nerve has not already been identified.</p>
<p>Once the facial nerve is identified the dissection should take
    place along the plane of the nerve lying just superficial
    to it (see Figure 12).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> The superficial lobe is stripped
        of the underlying facial nerve, which has divided into
        its upper and lower divisions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The next stage of the procedure will vary depending on whether
    tumour or sialadenitis is the indication:</p>
<ul>
    <li>sialadenitis:  morcelisation (fragmenting) of the gland lateral
        to the nerve is the quickest and the most effective way
        to remove it;</li>
    <li>tumour: the nerve branch is identified above and below the
        tumour so adequate excision can be carried out.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the tumour is confined to the deep lobe of the gland (medial
    to the facial nerve and usually behind the posterior border
    of the ramus of the mandible), it may be necessary to osteotomise
    (cut) the ramus (vertical part of the jaw bone) and mobilise
    the segments to allow adequate three-dimensional access for
    safe excision of the tumour (see Figure 13).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-salivary-gland-problems-level3-figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> A vertical subsigmoid osteotomy
        has been used to mobilise the mandible for access to
        the ‘deep lobe’ of the parotid gland.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A certain capacity to deal with the unexpected is an important
    asset in salivary gland surgery. Pure deep lobe tumours identified
    on imaging may be best approached using a labiomandibulotomy
    (splitting of the lip and mandible) approach along the floor
    of the mouth. The swinging out of the mandible provides excellent
    three-dimensional access to the lateral pharynx (throat).
    Another approach is purely from below but by dividing the
    digastric muscle.</p>
<p>Some surgeons will only carry out parotid surgery with a facial
    nerve monitor in constant use. Others find this an unwelcome
    distraction. Many will confirm the facial nerve trunk is
    functioning at the beginning and end of the operation using
    a facial nerve stimulator. Closure is with a drain and two-layered
    closure.</p>
