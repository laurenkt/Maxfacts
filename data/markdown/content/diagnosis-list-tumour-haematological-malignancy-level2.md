<p>The first part of this section outlines maxillofacial signs and
    symptoms of haematological malignancies. The second part
    briefly discusses oral and maxillofacial conditions arising
    during the treatment of haematological malignancies.</p>
<p>We keep this section brief because the exact diagnosis and treatment
    of haematological malignancies are taken care of by haematological
    oncology; oral and maxillofacial surgery has a support role
    in providing diagnosis (and <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/blood-malignancy">management/treatment</a>)
    of oral manifestations of these malignancies. More detailed
    information about all aspects of haematological malignancies
    can be found in the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">ample literature</a>    about the topic.</p>
<h1 id="oral-and-maxillofacial-signs-and-symptoms-of-haematological-malignancies">Oral and maxillofacial signs &amp; symptoms of haematological
    malignancies</h1>
<p>The oral and maxillofacial signs and symptoms associated with
    haematological malignancies are incredibly common signs and
    symptoms for many non-malignant conditions. Thus, only rarely
    will these be presenting signs of a haematological malignancy.
    However, along with all their other signs and symptoms, people
    with haematological malignancies typically have oral signs.</p>
<p><strong>Myeloma</strong> affects a type of white blood cells,
    the plasma cells. Plasma cells are an integral part of the
    body’s <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">adaptive immune system</a>    and are normally involved in the production of antibodies
    to fight infections.</p>
<p>Myeloma causes bone destruction (osteolytic lesions, painful
    ‘holes’ in the bone). The growth of myeloma cells hinders
    the normal function of bone-building cells (osteoblasts).
    In addition, the activity of cells that normally remove worn
    bone tissue (osteoclasts) is increased. This imbalance of
    making new and removing old bone tissue caused by myeloma
    leads to bone destruction. There may be a single lesion or,
    more commonly, multiple locations (multiple myeloma). In
    the maxillofacial region the bone lesions predominantly affect
    the skull and less often the jaws (see Figure 1).</p>

<p><strong>Lymphomas</strong> are malignancies of the lymphocytes,
    a sub-set of the white blood cells. There are many different
    types and variations of lymphomas (Hodgkin lymphoma is characterised
    by the presence of a particular type of cell, non-Hodgkin
    lymphoma are all others), with widely varied clinical behaviour,
    most of them manifest in the lymphatic system in the lymph
    nodes. Some lymphomas follow an orderly pattern of spread,
    and some lymphomas manifest in other tissues and organs (extranodal)
    as the malignant lymphocytes can infiltrate other tissues.</p>
<p>Oral manifestations of lymphoma can be difficult to distinguish
    from other conditions such as <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">osteomyelitis</a> and
    other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">malignancies</a>. Commonly
    mentioned signs and symptoms of oral manifestations of lymphoma
    are lumps and swellings (including the neck), pain, ulcerated
    lesions, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">disturbed sensation</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>.</p>
<p>The most common location of lymphomas in the maxillofacial region
    are the salivary glands, in particular the lymph nodes in
    the parotid gland. This can be as salivary associated lymphoma
    or a late complication of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">Sjögren’s syndrome</a>.</p>
<aside>
    <p>More information about the location of lymph nodes and the
        anatomy of the salivary glands is in our section about
        <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Other common locations of lymphoma infiltration are the tonsils,
    the nasal cavity, and the cervical (neck) lymph nodes. The
    most common location of lymphoma in hard tissue in the maxillofacial
    region is the maxilla (upper jaw). There are differences
    in locations between Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
<p>The term <strong>leukaemia</strong> covers a range of different
    malignancies of the blood system that affect different strands
    of white blood cells. These are T and B type lymphocytes
    (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic
    leukaemia (CLL)) or some white blood cells originating from
    the myeolid line (acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and chronic
    myelogenous leukaemia (CML); the terms myeloid and myelogenous
    have the same meaning and are both in use).</p>
<p>Similar to lymphoma cells, also leukaemic cells can infiltrate
    different tissues and lead to a variety of soft tissue deposits.
    Oral manifestations are common, in particular localised skin
    and mucosa infiltrations, including gingival hyperplasia
    (swellings of the gums), bleeding (petechiae) and haematoma
    in the oral cavity, oral ulcers, sometimes <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrotic lesions</a>,
    and inflammation of tonsils and throat. Approximately a quarter
    of patients with acute leukaemia report oral conditions as
    the first symptoms and nearly three quarters of leukaemia
    patients at some stage report oral symptoms.</p>
<h1 id="oral-and-maxillofacial-conditions-arising-from-the-treatment-of-haematological-malignancies">Oral and maxillofacial conditions arising from the treatment
    of haematological malignancies</h1>
<p>The main treatment modalities for haematological malignancies
    are <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> and
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> or combinations
    of both. Both treatment modalities typically have unwanted
    effects with oral manifestations which may have to be treated
    during treatment for haematological malignancy. The working
    principles of both <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles/more-info">chemotherapy</a>    and <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles">radiotherapy</a>    exploit the differences between rapidly and slowly replicating
    cell lines and cause significantly more harm to rapidly replicating
    cell lines (such as malignancies) but also the lining cells
    of the mouth or throat.</p>
<p>Healthy mucosa is a tissue with a high replication rate and thus
    is susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of chemo- and radiotherapies.
    Typically, there will be painful severe inflammation and
    ulceration (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">mucositis</a>)
    of the oral mucosa. The risk of infection of these oral lesions
    is high, with an added risk of tissue <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>    and an increased risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">developing sepsis</a>.
    This is highly relevant in the treatment of haematological
    malignancies as most infections under these circumstances
    are oral infections. Aggressive treatment strategies (for
    example, chemotherapy approaches in the treatment of childhood
    leukaemias) are more likely to lead to serious damage to
    oral (and other) mucosal tissue which may become severe enough
    to become treatment-limiting.</p>
<p>In addition, a bone marrow transplant from a genetically non-identical
    donor (allotransplant) for the treatment of leukaemia carries
    a risk for a serious complication called graft <i>versus</i>    host disease. Essentially, the donated graft rejects the
    host: the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">immune cells</a>    in the graft recognise the recipient’s body cells as foreign
    and consequently attack them (this is not the same as the
    host’s immune system recognising the transplanted graft cells
    as foreign). The complication can take the form of an acute
    crisis or a chronic form. Graft <i>versus</i> host disease
    causes oral ulcers which are at high risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    because of immunosuppression; chronic graft <i>versus</i>    host disease can cause a particular type of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">white mucosal patches</a>    with an enhanced risk for malignant transformation.</p>
