<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">Infection</a> is the general
    term describing invasion of the body by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microorganisms</a>,
    including bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi/spores.
    Antibiotic is the general term for drugs used to treat infections
    (anti-biotic literally means anti-life). Antibiotics include
    drugs with antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic
    properties.</p>
<p>Treatment modalities for infections may involve <a href="/treatment/surgery/infection">surgical</a>    or <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous">other interventions</a>    (for example treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">hyperbaric oxygen</a>),
    usually in conjunction with antibiotic medication. In some
    cases, infection is treated primarily (or solely) by medication(s).</p>
<p>Bacterial, viral and fungal infections are different conditions
    because the microorganisms causing the infections are different,
    and the ways in which the different types of infection affect
    the host are, therefore, different too. Accordingly, the
    strategies to treat these infections with medication(s) vary
    but all have one aspect in common: the drugs used to treat
    infections have to be considerably more toxic to the infectious
    microorganism(s) than to the host.</p>
<p><strong>Bacterial infections</strong> are characterised by a
    large number of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">different types of bacteria</a>    which can (and do) cause infections in humans requiring treatment.
    Since the original accidental discovery of antibacterial
    agents (penicillin; A. Fleming), <i>ca</i>. 150 different
    antibacterial drugs have been introduced to treat a wide
    variety of bacterial infections. Worldwide, antibacterial
    drugs are the second most widely used medications, second
    only to analgesics (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">drugs for treating pain</a>).
    Not all antibacterial drugs are relevant for the treatment
    of oral and maxillofacial bacterial infections, but some
    from each type of antibacterial agent are in use in this
    specialty.</p>
<p>Types of antibacterial drugs are classified according to the
    mechanisms by which they target bacteria; the four main targets
    are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>bacterial DNA</li>
    <li>bacterial metabolic processes (synthesis of folic acid (vitamin
        B<sub>9</sub>))</li>
    <li>bacterial protein synthesis</li>
    <li>bacterial cell wall synthesis</li>
</ul>
<p>Most antibacterial drugs are effective in treating infections
    by a range of bacteria of similar types. Most antibacterial
    agents aim to destroy their target pathogen, some mainly
    inhibit its growth. Unfortunately, in 2017 many infectious
    and harmful bacteria have developed <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">resistance</a>    to the effects of a number of mainstream antibacterial drugs,
    with drug resistance becoming increasingly problematic.</p>
<p><strong>Viral infections</strong> are more difficult to treat
    by medication: there are far fewer drugs with antiviral properties
    than there are antibacterial drugs (mainly drugs to treat
    HIV, some forms of hepatitis, influenza (flu) and herpes).
    It is much more difficult to develop antiviral drugs that
    are harmful to the pathogenic virus but not to the host:
    This is the case because a virus critically depends on the
    host’s metabolism for survival and propagation. Other than
    most antibacterial drugs, most antiviral drugs are highly
    specific and only affect one particular (type of) virus.
    While most antibacterial drugs kill their target pathogen(s),
    most antiviral drugs just inhibit the development of their
    target (type of) virus. Similar to antibacterial drugs, there
    are resistance issues also with antiviral drugs. Substances
    called monoclonal antibodies (substances that trigger the
    host immune system in some manner) may have some antiviral
    properties; these are niche applications and not yet fully
    established.</p>
<p>The best antiviral ‘drug’ in 2017 still is the body’s immune
    system, both with regard to preventing and fighting viral
    infections.</p>
<p><strong>Fungal infections</strong> are very common generally
    (think of athlete’s foot). Relevant fungal infections in
    an oral and maxillofacial context are all kinds of thrush
    (candidiasis), affecting the soft tissue in the mouth and
    the skin. Some rare types of fungal infections can cause
    meningitis (cryptococcal meningitis). Most antifungal agents
    harm or destroy fungi by attacking their cell walls. This
    is a common mechanism also of many antibacterial drugs. However,
    fungi and bacteria feature rather different cell walls and
    thus tend to be vulnerable to different chemicals, with some
    overlap. Antifungal substances can be applied systemically
    or topically (locally); whenever possible the latter is the
    preferred mode in order to avoid systemic unwanted side effects
    (in contrast, systemic application is appropriate for antibacterial
    drugs).</p>
