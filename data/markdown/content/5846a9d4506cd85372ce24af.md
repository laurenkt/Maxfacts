<p>Broadly speaking, cysts are defined as pathological cavities,
    lined with epithelium (the kind of tissue that covers the
    bodyâ€™s various surfaces) and filled with fluid, air or semi-solids.
    Figure 1 schematically illustrates such an epithelium-lined
    cavity.</p>

<p>A wide variety of cysts (of different origins) occur all over
    the body, affecting soft and hard tissues. Cysts can be further
    classified according to their type of epithelial lining.
    There are different theories about their formation.</p>
<p>To confuse matters a little further, there are some kinds of
    fluid-filled cavities in bones that are not lined by epithelium;
    these cavities are referred to as nonepithelial cysts (somewhat
    of a misnomer) or pseudo-cysts.</p>
<p>The head and neck region is home to a fair variety of cysts.
    For example, the most common cause of chronic swelling of
    the jaw is a cyst. There is much overlap with other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump">benign lumps</a>,
    occasionally <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    of cysts occur that may lead to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscesses</a>.
    Cysts, or pseudo-cysts, affecting the bones overlap with
    several other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone lesions</a>.</p>
<p>Cysts of the head and neck can be identified by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">clinical examination</a>    , distinct <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">history</a>    and some other diagnostic tests, particularly X-rays and
    other scan, in some cases a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>.</p>
