<p>Saliva fulfils several roles: <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">keeping mouth and teeth healthy</a>,
    helping with <a href="/help/salt">speaking</a> and last but
    not least enabling eating, chewing and swallowing.</p>
<p>Saliva consists of 97-99 percent water, so it is tempting to
    assume that it should be easy to replace saliva by water.
    Quite wrong, the small amounts of proteins and ions making
    up the remaining 1-3 percent make saliva a rather special,
    high-tech viscoelastic solution (for the specialists: this
    is called a non-Newtonian fluid). The viscosity of saliva
    depends on the shear force working on it when we chew or
    move food around in the mouth, or try to swallow. It actually
    has very special properties (tomato ketchup has some such,
    though simpler, properties: it gets slightly more liquid
    when you shake the bottle vigorously).</p>
<p>In addition the <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">process of swallowing</a>    is a truly complicated process. It is governed by a chain
    of commands, obtained from multiple sensors all over your
    mouth and throat, signalling when it is safe to swallow,
    and how (liquid or solid foods). Only when this feedback
    is positive and returns to brain and nerves the message that
    the lump of food in your mouth is ready for swallowing will
    this be a smooth and pleasant eating experience. Saliva produces
    the right kind of consistency of lumps of food in the mouth
    (called a bolus) to trigger a positive swallowing signal.
    Copious amounts of water will help to get food down but without
    the effects of saliva eating will feel like hard work: water
    will not properly lubricate most foods to a consistency that
    the swallowing sensors will accept as ‘okay’.</p>
<p>It is essential that saliva is such a versatile high-tech material
    because it needs to be ready, on the spot, for whatever we
    put in our mouth – from brittle biscuits to soft purees to
    very nearly liquid soups, not to mention chemically vastly
    different foods, ranging from starchy potatoes to fibrous
    protein-rich meat or fish. The feedback &amp; saliva system
    must be able to cope with all these circumstances almost
    instantaneously. Normally this works perfectly well but if
    one or several of the components in this complicated system
    do not function properly (for example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">insufficient saliva production</a>)
    we will have problems with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing</a>    and eating.</p>
<p>There are different modes of saliva production and different
    kinds of saliva, depending on what is needed at any given
    time and circumstance.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about the different kinds
        of saliva, there is more information on our <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">detailed page about saliva and eating</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>We have three pairs (left/right) of major salivary glands as
    well as many small glands all over the mouth (the minor salivary
    glands). When we rest only a little saliva is produced mostly
    by the submandibular and sublingual glands, just enough to
    keep the soft tissue (mucosa) in your mouth moist and to
    protect your teeth. Chewing and the tastes of foods (and
    their smell) signal the need to produce more saliva. About
    60 percent of the saliva under these working conditions is
    produced by the parotid glands (which are much less active
    at rest) and the composition of this on-demand saliva is
    different from that produced at rest.</p>
<p>The slightly more viscous saliva produced at rest by the submandibular
    and sublingual glands contains large protein molecules, called
    mucins. These proteins are an important part of the food
    lubrication at work, and they give the saliva its viscosity
    at rest. Under working/eating conditions the additionally
    on-demand produced saliva from the parotid glands is less
    viscous and does not contain mucins. Instead, the on-demand
    saliva contains an enzyme called amylase. Enzymes from the
    amylase family split very large molecules (such as starch)
    into smaller units (such as sugar molecules; you may have
    noticed that after chewing starchy food for a very long time
    it starts tasting slightly sweet). The role of amylase is
    not entirely clear beyond some such form of pre-digestion.
    Amylase may contribute to exposing food particles to <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste buds</a>    and may also play a role with clearing food from the mouth
    (amylase enzymes typically are a component of dishwasher
    tablets).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about how taste buds work,
        there is more information on our <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">detailed page about taste and texture of foods.</a></p>
</aside>
<p>Another important component in the on-demand saliva are molecules
    called statherins. These are powerful emulsifiers, they help
    to combine watery and fatty foods into smooth and homogeneous
    lumps, ready for swallowing.</p>
<p>If you suffer from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>    in order to help with eating you will likely want to try
    some <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">artificial salivas</a>    or take advantage of the <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubricating powers of some foods</a>.</p>
