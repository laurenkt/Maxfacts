<p>Postoperative problems affecting the upper arm include</p>
<ul>
    <li>The upper arm is a rare site for postoperative problems in
        maxillofacial surgery.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">Split skin grafts</a>        for reconstruction are occasionally harvested here. The
        defect is smaller but similar to the defect created by
        harvesting <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin grafts from the thigh</a>.</li>
    <li>A rarely used <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">free flap</a>,
        the lateral upper arm flap, creates a defect that is
        closed primarily but always leaves an area of numbness
        around the elbow joint and upper forearm. It can create
        dysfunction of the radial nerve with serious movement
        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">sensation disturbances</a>        of the hand on that side.</li>
    <li>Rarely <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">allergic reactions</a>        to adhesives placed on the upper arm may be noticed.</li>
</ul>
