<p>This page gives a more detailed description of some of the materials
    and methods used in the surgical treatment and repair of
    soft tissue damage.</p>
<h1 id="the-basics-asepsis-and-antisepsis">The basics: asepsis and antisepsis</h1>
<p>Let us just get started with the terminology:</p>
<p><strong>Sterilisation</strong> – refers to a process which results
    in the complete absence of microorganisms, including bacteria
    and bacterial spores, viruses and fungi.</p>
<p><strong>Asepsis</strong> – refers to a process which is close
    to sterile (‘surgical asepsis’) and ‘as good as can be’ in
    a living organism without causing tissue damage.</p>
<p><strong>Antisepsis</strong> – refers to a process which results
    in the absence of most pathogenic microorganisms. However,
    some bacteria, viruses and spores may still be present.</p>
<p><strong>Clean</strong> – refers to a reduction in the total bacterial
    count.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">Sepsis</a> was an
    almost universal complication of surgery and carried a high
    mortality until Joseph Lister, in 1867, in Scotland, proposed
    his ‘germ theory’ and put forward the idea of antisepsis
    to reduce infections in surgical patients. This was one of
    the major fundamental advances in surgery. Lister used so
    called carbolic acid (phenol in modern chemical terms) as
    an antiseptic for skin before surgery and used carbolic-acid
    drenched dressings afterwards.</p>
<p>Lister’s contributions to make surgery safer are also a wonderful
    illustration of early interdisciplinary collaboration and
    international cooperation (it seems that good things happen
    when Scottish surgeons and European scientists collaborate…).
    A few years before Lister’s ‘germ theory’ (and practice),
    Louis Pasteur as the Dean of Sciences at the University of
    Lille discovered the causative relationship between the presence
    of bacteria and infection in 1857 to 1863 from his work on
    fermentation. Lister scrutinised and advocated Pasteur’s
    work, while Pasteur publicised Lister’s medical applications
    and his ideas about antiseptic approaches to surgery in France.</p>
<p>The 19<sup>th</sup> century was an exceptional period in the
    history of surgery, a century full of improvements and discoveries,
    many with repercussions today. Amongst the numerous contributors
    to these innovative approaches was another Scottish surgeon,
    Lawson Tait. A little later in the 19<sup>th</sup> century
    than Lister, he also strongly advocated what he called ‘asepsis’
    in surgery, avoiding Lister’s carbolic acid, with similarly
    improved results over traditional approaches. Ignaz Semmelweiss
    in Vienna in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century had demonstrated
    impressively the beneficial effects of washing hands with
    antiseptics before treating patients (in particular saving
    countless lives of women in childbirth). Ernst von Bergmann,
    a German surgeon in Würzburg and Berlin, is another 19<sup>th</sup>    century pioneer and driver of innovation in surgery: he introduced
    methods to sterilise surgical instruments in an autoclave.
    Finally, toward the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the
    American surgeon William S. Halstead pioneered the use of
    sterile latex gloves and the then modern approaches to
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">anaesthesia</a> in surgery. Stop for a second and consider;
        surgery as we know it has only been possible for just
        over a century.</p>
<h1 id="materials-for-wound-cleansing">Materials for wound cleansing</h1>
<p>There are a variety of cleansing solutions available, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Normal saline (9 g of NaCl per 1000 ml H<sub>2</sub>O)</li>
    <li>Chlorhexidine 0.5 % (aqueous)</li>
    <li>Chlorhexidine 0.5 % (alcohol based)</li>
    <li>Iodine (povidone iodine) 1% (aqueous)</li>
    <li>Iodine (povidone iodine) 1% (alcohol based)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Normal saline</strong> (sometimes called ‘isotonic saline,
    because the Na<sup>+</sup> ion concentration is similar to
    that in blood plasma) has little antiseptic effect but is
    the least irritant to the tissues. It makes an excellent
    solution for irrigation (‘lavage’) of wounds during exploration
    and cleansing. Sterile saline solution in abundance is quite
    adequate (‘the solution to pollution is dilution’).</p>
<p><strong>Iodine</strong> is an effective antiseptic and is widely
    used for skin disinfection in the form of povidone-iodine
    (a readily water-soluble mixture of a polymer, hydrogen iodide
    and elemental iodine). Povidone-iodine has been shown to
    be effective against MRSA and to date no <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">bacterial resistance</a>    to it has been reported. It is also effective against other
    bacteria, spores, viruses and fungi. Because of this, iodine
    has replaced most <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">topical antibiotics</a>.
    The main disadvantage is that some people may develop sensitivity
    to iodine; it should thus be used only in the short term.
    It should also not be used on large wounds because here significant
    absorption of iodine may occur, and the iodine is also destructive
    to human cells (although less than to pathogens). The alcoholic
    solution is an irritant to wounds and dangerous on the face
    near the eyes; it is also a fire hazard. Aqueous solutions
    are the only preparations used for facial wound disinfection.</p>
<p><strong>Chlorhexidine</strong> is an effective antiseptic which
    is less of an irritant to the tissues than iodine. It is
    an alternative when allergy to iodine is a problem (and is
    commonly used for ‘scrubbing up’ of the surgeon). Chlorhexidine
    is unusual in that when it is used in the mouth, it binds
    to both tooth enamel and epithelial cells and leaches out
    over time, thus providing a long-acting effect. This may
    account for the evidence that suggests that chlorhexidine-containing
    mouthwashes are more effective than others in controlling
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">oral bacterial infections</a>.</p>
<p>Direct irrigation of deep and obviously infected puncture wounds
    with a 20 % <strong>solution of hydrogen peroxide</strong>    (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in water) followed by saline
    irrigation is a useful occasional technique and an effective
    haemostatic manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, it has been shown that all
    these antiseptics inhibit fibroblastic activity and therefore
    interfere with wound healing. Their use in cleaning infected
    wounds is not essential because the more important factor
    is the volume of solution used. Sterile saline solution in
    abundance is quite adequate, although a diluted povidone-iodine
    solution used both to scrub mechanically and irrigate ‘dirty’
    wounds is commonplace.</p>
<p>Hair-covered epidermis may pose a problem when exploring and
    closing wounds, particularly when a wound is complex. For
    simpler wounds, provided that that access is good and cleansing
    and débridement is easily achievable, it may be acceptable
    to leave hair in cosmetic areas alone or to trim it. However,
    where the presence of hair is likely to make cleansing, débridement
    or closure difficult or when hair is likely to become trapped
    in a wound, the hair around the wound should be shaved prior
    to cleansing. There is, however, evidence to suggest that
    wound infection rates increase significantly if the wound
    area is shaved in elective surgery. A pragmatic compromise
    is needed here.</p>
<h1 id="commonly-used-wound-dressings">Commonly used wound dressings</h1>
<p><strong>Traditional</strong> (for example, gauze and Gamgee (made
    from layers of absorbent cotton wool placed between two layers
    of gauze (after the inventor, surgeon J.S. Gamgee, Birmingham,
    1880)) – these are useful as a secondary dressing to help
    to control exudate.</p>
<p><strong>Low adherent</strong> – these are useful on wounds that
    have a low exudate, in securing skin grafts or on burns or
    abrasions. Some are silicone polymers which may improve scar
    quality.</p>
<p><strong>Alginate dressings</strong> – these are dry absorbent
    dressings made from <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">seaweed</a>.
    The dressing absorbs exudate from the wound and becomes a
    gel. Alginates are also useful as haemostats. They should
    not be used on dry wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Charcoal dressings</strong> – these contain activated
    charcoal which is effective in absorbing chemicals released
    from fungating, smelly and necrotic wounds. Some charcoal
    dressings also contain silver which helps to reduce bacterial
    growth.</p>
<p><strong>Foams</strong> – these are synthetic dressings made of
    hydrophilic polyurethane which absorb wound exudate and maintain
    a moist wound healing environment. Foams can be used on moderate
    to heavily exudating wounds which are healthy and granulating.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrocolloids</strong> – these consist of a hydrocolloid
    base made from <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">gelatine, cellulose or pectin</a>.
    They are completely occlusive and provide a moist wound healing
    environment. Fluid from the wound is absorbed into the dressing
    and forms a gel. They are useful on necrotic, sloughy and
    granulating wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Enzyme preparations</strong> – these contain two enzymes:
    streptokinase and streptodornase and are used to débride
    wounds, especially wounds with a necrotic eschar.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrogels</strong> – these dressings are made up of a
    <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">copolymer starch</a>    and have high water content. They can be used to débride
    necrotic tissue or sloughy, granulating and epithelializing
    wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Impregnated dressings</strong> – some of these are made
    from woven cotton which is impregnated with paraffin. These
    are commonly used on minor burns, abrasions, split skin grafts
    and donor sites. Other impregnated dressings are made of
    rayon mesh, impregnated with 10 % povidone – iodine solution
    (see above). The iodine is released directly onto the wound.</p>
<p><strong>Vapour-permeable films</strong> – these are semi-permeable,
    adhesive film dressings which prevent evaporation of water
    from the wound. They should only be used on superficial low
    exudate wounds. These dressings can be useful in the prevention
    of pressure sore formation over bony prominences by reducing
    friction.</p>
<p><strong>Antibacterial creams</strong> – these contain silver
    sulphadiazine 1 % (a topical broad spectrum <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial agent</a>    which inhibits the growth of nearly all pathogenic bacteria
    and fungi <i>in vitro</i>. This is particularly effective
    against <i>pseudomonas</i> and <i>staphylococcus aureus</i>    and is widely used in the treatment of burns.</p>
<p><strong>Haemostatic agents</strong> – these are forms of oxidised
    cellulose that promote clotting, fibrin foams are effective
    on bleeding bone ends.</p>
<p><strong>Glues</strong> – these fibrin-based tissue glues can
    be used on skin wounds and (as a spray or drops) to stick
    grafts or flaps to concave wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Vac-pacs</strong> – these are basically adherent dressings
    which allow the generation of a modest vacuum (reduced pressure)
    within the sealed area. They promote healing to a sometimes
    remarkable extent.</p>
<h1 id="materials-for-wound-closure-with-sutures">Materials for wound closure with sutures</h1>
<p>Many different sutures are now available and are generally classified
    as absorbable or non-absorbable.</p>
<p><strong>Absorbable sutures</strong> include those made of</p>
<ul>
    <li>polyglactin 910 (copolymer of a lactic acid diester and glycoside)
        – braided resorbables which are absorbed by hydrolysis;</li>
    <li>polyglycolic acid</li>
    <li>copolymer of glycolide and epsilon-caprolactone – a monofilament
        that is less irritant for subcuticular use;</li>
    <li>catgut (from sheep) has been discontinued for clinical use
        in the UK but is available in the US.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-absorbable sutures</strong> include those made of</p>
<ul>
    <li>nylon, polypropylene, polybutester (a benzoic acid derivative)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nylon has less memory than polypropylene and ‘polybutester’ but
    is marginally more irritant. These are the usual sutures
    for closing skin wounds.</p>
<ul>
    <li>silk – is essentially and temporary suture material nowadays.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sutures may also be classified according to their structure</p>
<ul>
    <li>monofilament (see Figure 1) – these minimise infection, produce
        less tissue reaction and are the suture of choice for
        skin;</li>
    <li>twisted or braided - these have plaited strands, which provide
        secure knots but may act like a wick causing a focus
        for infection.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A typical monofilament nylon suture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Traditionally, silk has been used in the mouth as it is easy
    to handle, strong, and the ends are comfortable for the patient.
    Its major disadvantage is that it must be removed. Polyglactin
    sutures are also popular, since they resorb, and hence do
    not need to be removed.</p>
<h1 id="suture-techniques">Suture techniques</h1>
<p>Not only is there a large selection of suture materials, the
    range of suture techniques is enormous and will accommodate
    the requirements of a wide range of wounds. These techniques
    include interrupted and continuous sutures, which may be
    locking or non-locking and resemble stitching techniques
    used in embroidery. Methods for layered wound closure, such
    as vertical and horizontal mattress sutures, confer strength
    to a wound without suture scars. Subcuticular sutures run
    in a winding snake like fashion just under the surface of
    the skin and may be pulled out or left in depending on whether
    or not the material dissolves. Metal staples of various types
    are a very rapid method of closing skin which won’t scar
    if taken out within 10 days. Paper strips can hold the skin
    surface together if the wound has deep sutures which remove
    tension. Various tissue glues can be used in a similar fashion.</p>
<h2>Interrupted sutures</h2>
<p>Interrupted sutures, where individual stitches are not connected,
    are the most common technique for wound closure.</p>
<p>Following cleansing and débridement, the appropriate suture material
    for the tissue is selected. The wound margins are accurately
    opposed such that when closed they will align in the correct
    position. If there are no clues, such as skin creases or
    angles in the wound, straight wounds may be brought together
    by means of skin hooks at either end of the wound, creating
    apposition under gentle tension. The suture needle is held
    with the needle holder positioned at least one third away
    from the end of the suture attachment. This reduces the chance
    of bending or breakage of the needle in the wound. A ‘bite’
    of skin is taken at a landmarked site, the size of the bite
    depending on the depth of the wound (the deeper the wound,
    the further the bite from the wound edge). The suture needle
    is advanced to the depth of the wound margin and then out
    through the wound opening. The needle is next inserted <i>via</i>    the depth of the wound and rotated up through the opposite
    skin margin and the landmarked site for apposition of the
    wound. The breadth of bite of skin by the suture on either
    side of the wound should be the same. If the bites are inconsistent,
    ‘stepping’ of the skin will occur when the suture is knotted,
    and ultimately scarring.</p>
<p>If the suture is correctly placed and approximates the wound
    margins accurately, the knot should be tied in the suture
    (the first knot of the suture is a double-loop which creates
    a knot with some resistance to loosening; see Figure 2) to
    bring the margins together, such that the skin edge is slightly
    everted. Inverted skin margins will heal with a poor aesthetic
    result. Once the correct suture position is achieved, the
    suture should be ‘locked’ with a further knot or series of
    knots.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-damage-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Looping the suture material twice
        around the needle holder to create the first part of
        the knot.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Aftercare of closed wounds on the face, neck and scalp benefits
    from application of a thin layer of sterile petroleum jelly
    (conveniently found in <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibiotic (chloramphenicol)</a>    eye ointment) which keeps the wound moisturised and clean
    and minimises crusting, thus making suture removal easier.
    In wounds under high tension or muscular activity, intramuscular
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">botulinum-alpha toxin</a>    injected on either side of the wound can be helpful: it temporarily
    removes activities creating stretching forces on the scar.</p>
<h2>Reasons for failure of sutures:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>breakage – the tensile strength of the suture material is
        too low or the suture is too small;</li>
    <li>cutting out – too fine a suture material is used or the suture
        is placed in friable tissue;</li>
    <li>knot slippage – inadequate tying (Every material other than
        silk benefits from an extra throw on the conventional
        surgeons knot);</li>
    <li>extruded suture – occurs in combination with infection;</li>
    <li>resorption is too rapidly – nonabsorbable or more slowly
        absorbable suture material should have been used;</li>
    <li>removal too early – suture is removed before sufficient healing.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="wound-healing">Wound healing</h1>
<p>Following tissue trauma, there is an initial acute inflammatory
    response. Protein-rich exudate is released into the wound.
    Coagulation of blood occurs as fibrinogen is converted to
    fibrin. White blood cells, lymphocytes and phagocytes, migrate
    to the wound. Capillaries and lymphatic vessels infiltrate
    the wound to form granulation tissue, epithelial cells multiply
    from the margins of intact skin and begin to grow across
    the surface of the wound. Fibroblasts and collagen fibres
    begin to appear within the wound as the tissue becomes organised.
    Contracture of the wound occurs as healing continues and
    the blood vessels become less obvious. The fibrous tissue
    in the wound eventually matures to form a ‘scar’.</p>
<h1 id="wound-infections">Wound infections</h1>
<p>Wounds may become infected at any stage</p>
<p>Wounds which are frankly infected pre-operatively or have failed
    to heal with post-operative infection should not normally
    be closed until the infection has been eradicated. Once the
    infection has been treated <i>and</i> resolved, it may be
    appropriate to debride and close it or to allow the wound
    to heal by granulation. Primary closure is usually delayed
    in contaminated wounds where there has been a delay in treatment.
    The wound is usually dressed and remains open for up to five
    days to ensure infection has not taken hold before further
    debridement and closure.</p>
<p>The infecting organisms may come from a variety of sources –
    either endogenous or exogenous. Most wounds encountered,
    other than clean surgical wounds, must be considered contaminated
    and therefore require <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotic treatment</a>.
    Whilst an ‘informed guess’ may often be made as to the most
    likely causative organism and antimicrobial therapy commenced
    on that basis, it is important to take swabs of the wound
    and send them for culture and sensitivity analysis to ensure
    the appropriate drug regimen is in place.</p>
<h2>Common wound infecting organisms</h2>
<p><strong><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i></strong> is the most frequent
    cause of wound infection. It is commonly found in the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">commensal skin flora</a> of around 30 % of the population.
        There are a variety of strains of <i>s. aureus</i>, which
        vary in their virulence, whilst multiple antibiotic resistance
        is on the increase (MRSA, see below); the more common
        strains of <i>s. aureus</i> still tend to be sensitive
        to flucloxacillin and similar <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibiotics from the penicillin class</a>.</p>
<p><strong><i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i></strong>, whilst far less
    common than <i>s. aureus</i> is still found in many wound
    infections. It is usually sensitive to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">penicillin</a>.</p>
<p>The above organisms will be the most likely cause of infection
    in most facial wounds where other sources of contamination
    have been ruled out. Therefore, initial treatment of such
    wound infections with flucloxacillin, co-fluampicil (mixture
    of flucloxacillin and ampicillin) or co-amoxyclav (mixture
    of ampicillin and clavulanic acid) is effective in most cases.
    Clarithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic), clindamycin (similar
    to macrolide antibiotics) or doxycycline (a tetracycline
    derivative) are the alternatives of choice in such infections
    when somebody is allergic to the penicillin. The cross reactivity
    between penicillins and cephalosporins (a beta-lactam derivative)
    has probably been overstated in the past.</p>
<h2>Other organisms</h2>
<p>Depending on the source of contamination, wounds may be infected
    with <i>enterococci</i>, other <i>streptococci</i> or <i>staphylococci</i>,
    <i>clostridium species</i> or there may be mixed infections.</p>
<p>Most aerobes will be sensitive to penicillin, flucloxacillin,
    a cephalosporin, or erythromycin and for anaerobes, metronidazole
    is the drug of choice.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to read in detail about the various antibacterial
        drugs and their working mechanisms, this information
        is on our pages about <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">treatment of infections by medication</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>MRSA is a methicillin (multiply) resistant strain of <i>staphylococcus aureus.</i>    MRSA is difficult to treat as it is resistant to most antibiotics,
    intravenous vancomycin being one of the few treatments to
    be effective in most cases. In a hospital setting, cross-infection
    control must be put in place to prevent this organism from
    being spread between patients.</p>
<p><strong><i>Clostridium species</i></strong> include <i>clostridium tetani</i>.
    The importance of checking the tetanus immunisation status
    cannot be over-emphasised. <i>Clostridium species</i> are
    also responsible for ‘gas gangrene’ whereby the infection
    causes rapid <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">tissue necrosis</a>    <i>via</i> bacterial toxins, and gases are produced. ‘Synergistic
    gangrene’ may be caused by a mixed infection of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">aerobes and anaerobes</a>    and also results in tissue necrosis. Both forms of gangrene
    can be rapidly fatal and require urgent treatment with
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">broad-spectrum antibiotics</a>, wide margin excision of the
        wound, and lavage with hydrogen peroxide (see above).</p>
<p><strong><i>Streptococcus milleri</i></strong> is the organism
    most frequently found in serious <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrosis-producing</a>    head and neck infections. Radical débridement with the appropriate
    antibiotics as early as possible is the appropriate tactic.</p>
