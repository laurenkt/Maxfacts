<h1 id="the-evolutionary-process-of-metastasis">The evolutionary process of metastasis</h1>
<p>The development and growth of a malignant tumour as well as metastasis
    can be understood and described as evolutionary processes
    which occur in stages. Two models of the processes have been
    described. In the so called linear development model, metastasis
    will only kick in in the late developmental phase of the
    primary tumour. The parallel evolution model describes a
    different timing scenario, where the primary malignancy and
    metastasis develop simultaneously and where various mechanisms
    of metastasis begin early and continue throughout. The latter
    model can explain the development over time of metastases
    with widely varied (genetic) properties and behaviour (see
    below). Recent research points to a continuum of the two
    models over time, with a shift between linear and parallel
    processes taking place over time. However, both models are
    not very refined because they do not take into account any
    genetically heterogeneous make-up of a primary tumour or
    any metastases.</p>
<p>The initiation of a primary malignant tumour is the first ‘learning
    step’ of normal cells to acquire the potential for unlimited
    growth, particular survival abilities and some genomic instability
    (and thus flexibility and adaptability). These new abilities
    of cells in becoming malignant cells are usually brought
    about by genetic mutations that often lead to the inactivation
    of genes that suppress tumour growth. Many of these oncogenic
    mutations that lead to the establishment of a primary malignancy
    are well researched and understood, the genetics of the formation
    and evolution of metastases (and the recurrence of a malignancy)
    much less so.</p>
<h2>Malignant cells of the primary tumour becoming mobile</h2>
<p>With the exception of blood cells, the various body organ and
    tissue cells in mammals (including humans) are stationary
    and do not travel around the body. In healthy tissues, specific
     tissue cells recognise each other by means of messenger
    molecules on the cell surface and specialised protein molecules
    on the cell surface act as ‘glue’ to keep the cells of an
    organ together.</p>
<p>Malignant cells lack some of the surface molecules that keep
    healthy tissue cells together, so in principle have the ability
    to be detached from a cohort of malignant cells, that is
    from a tumour site. The process adopted by malignant cells
    for this purpose is similar to the mechanisms at work in
    the development of an embryo or in wound healing (epithelial-mesenchymal
    transition).</p>
<p>There has to be some driving force for malignant cells to leave
    their original location and there have to be properties that
    distinguish the mobile malignant cells from those of a stationary,
    original tumour. This part of the process is not yet completely
    understood but there is a large body of ongoing research
    on this topic. For example, initial suggestions include the
    implication of a particular gene, p53, that is involved in
    the regulation of cell death (apoptosis) as well as cell
    birth (there are thousands of research publications about
    p53). Ongoing and evolving variability and genomic instability
    play a role (some small local DNA variations known as copy
    number variations have attracted attention) – new, genetically
    slightly altered copies (clones) of malignant cells may simply
    be programmed to be mobile, or some local and relatively
    minor genetic variations may favour the development of mobile
    cells. In addition, the physiological conditions in the tumour
    tissue may be an important driving factor. In many solid
    tumours there is insufficient blood supply and consequently,
    the tumour tissue suffers hypoxia (lack of oxygen supply).
    This lack of oxygen causes stress for the malignant cells
    and may be another factor leading to mobilisation of cells
    from the tissue (interestingly, hypoxia also makes cells
    more resistant to <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles">radiotherapy treatment</a>).</p>
<p>With different primary malignancies developing from different
    body tissues and cell types, it seems intuitively convincing
    that different malignant tumours will display a wide range
    of tendencies for the formation of local and/or distant metastases
    (as is observed clinically). Patterns of preference for the
    location of distant metastases (organ tropism) in certain
    organs, depending on the primary malignancy, in part are
    explained by anatomical facts, such as the distribution pathways
    for the spread of metastases (see below).</p>
<h2>Malignant cells of the primary tumour having become mobile –
    distribution channels</h2>
<p>In order to travel around the body and possibly start new growth
    in remote parts of the body (distant metastases), there are
    two principal distribution channels: the lymphatic system
    and direct entry into the blood stream (haematogenous route).
    Entry into the blood stream may also occur <i>via</i> an
    initial entry into the lymphatic system and further distribution
    from there. This process usually involves local lymphatic
    vessels and local or regional lymph nodes.</p>
<p>In order to be able to enter blood or lymphatic vessels, the
    mobile malignant cells have to acquire further abilities.
    For example, the travelling cells need to produce certain
    enzymes (proteinases) that can digest tissue (such as the
    protective membranes of blood vessels) to enable, or ease,
    invasion into the blood stream (such abilities also help
    the primary, stationary tumour to invade adjacent tissue).</p>
<p>The lymphatic system, including the lymph nodes, plays a particularly
    important role. The normal physiological task of the lymphatic
    system is to provide protection from infection and all kinds
    of invasion of the body by foreign agents. The lymphatic
    fluid carries migrating cells, pathogens and other biological
    macromolecules to the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are essentially
    filter stations, distributed all over the body, where alien
    agents and pathogens get removed from circulation and are
    disabled.</p>
<aside>
    <p>A detailed description of the lymphatic system and lymph
        node distribution in the head and neck region is given
        in our section on <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>For a number of reasons, the lymphatic system is an ideal target
    for the initial invasion of predominantly local lymph nodes.
    There tends to be increased pressure in tumour tissue. Accordingly,
    mobile malignant cells may end up being carried passively
    into the lymphatic system. In line with its normal physiological
    role, the lining of the lymphatic system is structured such
    that it enables permeation by particles. For example, the
    peripheral lymphatic capillaries have no, or only an incomplete,
    basement membrane. This also makes it easier for tumour cells
    to enter the lymphatic system – the mobile malignant cells
    have to acquire fewer additional abilities than is necessary
    to enter blood vessels directly. Malignant cells may be travelling
    as single cells or in small groups of identical or dissimilar
    clones.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is possible for malignant cells from the
    primary tumour to directly enter the blood system, if they
    have the right set of abilities (this is more often seen
    in connective tissue malignancies (sarcomas) than in epithelial
    malignancies (carcinomas); melanoma being a malignancy of
    specialist pigment-producing cells defies categorisation
    in this way and can do both). Alternatively, once a colony
    of malignant cells is established in a regional lymph node
    (see below), these cells can further adapt and acquire the
    abilities needed to invade the blood stream starting from
    the lymphatic system. That can be a more efficient mechanism
    than direct entry into the blood stream: the malignant cells
    already had to develop a sub-set of abilities to be able
    to enter the lymphatic system and may only need to acquire
    a smaller range of additional abilities to move on.</p>
<h2>Systemic metastases</h2>
<p>Only a small minority of malignant cells that enter the blood
    or lymphatic system will end up forming metastases: only
    malignant cells with the ability to replicate can do so (so
    called tumour stem cells). In addition to this fundamental
    ability of a cell, it is also necessary for it to have escaped
    the body’s immune system (often by stealth), to form a bond
    with tissue in the new location (using ‘glue’ proteins on
    the cell surface that fit the new environment; by expression
    of suitable surface markers) and to initiate the formation
    of a blood supply for the newly growing metastasis (angiogenesis).
    This is true for the formation of metastases in regional
    lymph nodes as well as for the formation of distant metastases.</p>
<p>Essentially, the remote colony of malignant cells repeats the
    process of establishing the primary tumour in a regional
    or distant new location. If this colony in the distant site
    arrived there <i>via</i> an intermediate stage as a metastasis
    in a regional lymph node and entered the blood stream from
    there, this cohort of malignant cells will likely already
    have acquired many of the abilities and functions needed
    to settle and grow a new tumour.</p>
<p>Some organs and tissues are prone to the establishment of metastases,
    especially liver, lungs and bone marrow. These organs have
    a particularly rich blood supply, enhancing the chances of
    migrating malignant cells in the blood stream to travel there,
    and to get established there. Moreover, recent research has
    found hints that the primary tumour may be actively involved
    in the establishment of a new distant colony by shedding
    small membrane particles which can transport growth factors
    to the new location, helping the newly arrived malignant
    cells to establish a new colony.</p>
<p>The genomic instability of a malignant tumour is a pre-requisite
    to form metastases, and these have similar attributes. New
    clones of the primary tumour and/or metastases are being
    formed all the time. The more aggressive and flexible the
    clone, the higher its success rate will be (until the host
    is killed by the disease). The Darwinian pressure to evolve
    explains why many metastases are not genetically identical
    with the primary tumour: only cells with certain additional
    abilities were able to migrate, to re-settle and to replicate.
    Accordingly, therapies that are able to treat the primary
    tumour may not always be able to treat the metastases. This
    is especially true when a primary tumour continually produces
    new metastases. These will show an increasing degree of genetic
    diversity such that some colonies of metastases become resistant
    to treatment. The Darwinian evolutionary pressures also explain
    why many primary tumours themselves are not genetically homogenous.
    There is much need for research using careful genetic mapping
    of primary tumours, metastases and, where applicable, recurrent
    primary tumours: a complete map of the genetic evolution
    of the intricate systems of primary malignancy and its metastases
    will eventually help to improve treatment, or even prevent
    or slow the development of metastases. Despite extremely
    rapid recent advances in the understanding of the biochemistry
    of metastasis, there remains a huge body of work to be done.
    It is so important to clarify all these mechanisms because
    there are profound implications for the treatment of malignant
    disease at various stages: take for example a primary malignant
    tumour which has seeded a metastasis in a regional lymph
    node and in a distant location. The two metastases may be
    identical clones of each other, or they may differ. If the
    local lymph node functions as a gateway for further spread,
    one can argue that removal of local lymph nodes should diminish
    further spread. If there is independent haematogenous dissemination
    without involvement of local or regional lymph nodes, the
    argument may well be not in favour of clearing the local
    lymph nodes. Or would such an argument be completely useless
    if, for example, any micrometastases (see below) established
    in a local lymph node would not just have the ability to
    initiate distant metastases, but could also re-seed a new
    version of the original tumour in its old location (commonly
    called a recurrence)? There are indeed many questions to
    investigate and to answer.</p>
<h1 id="metastasis-and-head-and-neck-malignancies">Metastasis and head &amp; neck malignancies</h1>
<p>Head and neck malignancies have a relatively low tendency for
    the formation of distant systemic metastases. However, the
    local and regional lymph system plays a major role in these
    malignant lesions. This can be understood from some straightforward
    considerations of anatomy. There are roughly 800 lymph nodes
    in the human body; about 300 of these are in the head and
    neck region. The oral cavity and nearby regions have a very
    dense network of peripheral lymphatic capillaries, connected
    to multiple lymph nodes in the neck. This makes perfect sense
    when one thinks about normal body function: with the mouth
    and nose being the body’s gateway to the outside world, infection
    prevention and invasion control are especially important
    in that part of the body. On the other hand, it also means
    that any oral malignancies reside in a part of the body with
    particularly rich opportunities for spread to local lymphatics
    and regional lymph nodes.</p>
<p>From a clinical and pragmatic view this means that the cervical
    lymph nodes (the lymph nodes in the neck) are of considerable
    importance. They are part of a response to limit the spread
    of malignant cells but they also act as a filter and repository
    of those cells.</p>
<p>This can be clinically obvious; the enlarged nodes can be seen
    or felt, identifiable on specialist imaging such as <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound scans</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI images</a> or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/pet-scans">PET/CT scans</a>,
    or only identifiable after specialist <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histopathological techniques</a>.</p>
<p>Micrometastases are microscopic deposits of malignant cells (usually
    squamous cells) identified after a meticulous pathological
    retrieval of lymph nodes from an operative specimen (one
    of the various types of <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">neck dissection</a>)
    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">analysed microscopically</a>.</p>
<p>It is often said of head and neck cancer that the presence of
    a malignant neck node halves the chance of surviving the
    cancer. This is an unhelpful and inaccurate statement. Unhelpful
    because it doesn’t influence the choice of treatments and
    inaccurate because the statement was based on data where
    a ‘positive’ neck node was one detectable clinically. The
    truth is, we don’t yet know the significance of micrometastases
    (see above) and many of the more specialist units have demonstrated
    far better 5 year survival figures than previously shown.</p>
<p>What is true is that the more advanced the cancer is, the poorer
    the prognosis is for that particular type of cancer (for
    example, the prognosis for an advanced squamous cell <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oral carcinoma</a>    in a non-smoking patient whose cancer is driven by an oncogenic
    HPV (virus infection) infection is much better than a similar
    stage cancer which is not HPV driven in a patient who smokes).</p>
<p>The involvement of neck lymph nodes implies a more advanced cancer
    but <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">treatment</a>    is still carried out with curative intent.This means that
    the cancer and its associated draining lymph nodes are either
    surgically removed or irradiated (or in some cases both).
    The loss of this large number of lymph nodes does not seem
    to have any adverse immunological effect but does create
    to a greater or lesser extent swelling by fluid retention
    (lymphoedema). There are a number of different ways of
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">removing the lymph nodes</a>.</p>
<p>Overall the treatment of a primary cancer and the regional lymph
    nodes is part of the treatment package ‘with curative intent’.
    Once the metastases have spread beyond that region (in the
    case of head and neck cancer this is essentially below the
    clavicle) the intention of treatment becomes palliative as
    there are no currently curative treatments for systemic metastases
    from oral, oropharyngeal or facial and scalp skin cancers.
    This does not mean to say that treatment cannot or should
    not be offered as even radical treatment with palliative
    intent can help some people, but the balance of harm and
    benefit changes.</p>
