<p>Nearly all relevant maxillofacial malignancies and / or relevant
    aspects of other malignancies we describe and discuss either
    in several dedicated sections or as part of other sections
    on this website:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">mouth cancer</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">facial skin cancer</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland">salivary gland cancer</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone cancer</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">cancers of the blood and lymphatic system</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>        (to and from the maxillofacial region).</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves a group of rare, soft tissue malignancies; soft tissue
    sarcomas. A sarcoma is a malignant growth that originates
    from cells that were formed from the mesenchyme, an undifferentiated
    connective tissue that is present during early foetal development
    (carcinoma refers to a malignant growth that arises from
    epithelial cells (cells in the tissues that line the surfaces
    and cavities of the body and its organs)). The musculoskeletal
    system and connective tissues include cancellous bone, cartilage,
    fatty tissue cells, all three types of muscle, nerve structures
    and blood and lymph vessels. Accordingly, soft tissue sarcomas
    are seen in all parts of the body, including the maxillofacial
    region.</p>
<p>Soft tissue makes up the bulk of our bodies, yet soft tissue
    sarcomas are rare malignancies (estimated less than 3 % of
    all malignancies). The majority (80 to 90 %) of malignancies
    are carcinomas, with malignancies of the blood and lymphatic
    system accounting for approximately 5 to 10 %. Despite it
    being a rare malignancy, there are many different varieties
    of sarcomas.</p>
<p>Soft tissue sarcomas seen in the maxillofacial region include</p>
<ul>
    <li>liposarcoma (originating from fat tissue; the most common
        in the maxillofacial region)</li>
    <li>leiomyosarcoma (originating from smooth muscle cells; overall
        the most common sarcoma)</li>
    <li>rhabdomyosarcoma (originating from skeletal (striated) muscle
        cells, mostly in children (third most common solid tumour
        in children) but occurs at all ages)</li>
    <li>angiosarcoma (originating from blood or lymph vessels)</li>
    <li>Kaposi sarcoma (affecting mainly skin and mouth, caused by
        human herpes virus HHV8; people with advanced HIV infection
        or fully developed AIDS are most vulnerable)</li>
    <li>malignant nerve sheath tumours (neurofibrosarcoma and malignant
        schwannoma; originate from fatty tissue cells that cover
        nerves; may be related to / develop from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed">benign tumours of nerve tissue</a>).</li>
</ul>
