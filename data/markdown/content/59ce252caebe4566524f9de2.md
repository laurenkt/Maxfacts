<p>The treatment and/or management of dry-mouth problems (xerostomia)
    can be broadly divided into five categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li>identification and successful treatment of underlying disease
        (for example, well controlled diabetes)</li>
    <li>identification and change of medication causing xerostomia
        (for example, there are a range of different medications
        to treat high blood pressure)</li>
    <li>use of medication to increase saliva production (often accompanied
        by side-effects)</li>
    <li>attempts to prevent the occurrence of xerostomia as a long-term
        effect of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        in the head and neck region</li>
    <li>management of chronic xerostomia (for example, as a symptom
        of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">Sjögren’s syndrome</a>,
        or following radiotherapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The treatment of most of the underlying systemic diseases, such
    as diabetes, or medications for the treatment of, for example
    cardiovascular conditions or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">allergies</a>    are not the focus of a maxillofacial clinic and will not
    be discussed further here.</p>
<p>Attempts to improve salivation, attempts to prevent xerostomia
    following radiotherapy and the best possible management of
    chronic xerostomia are topics in the maxillofacial clinic
    and we will discuss these topics in a little more detail
    in the following section.</p>
