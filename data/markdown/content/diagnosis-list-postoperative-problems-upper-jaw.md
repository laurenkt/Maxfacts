<p>Postoperative problems affecting the upper jaw (maxilla) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pain, discomfort and swelling as with all forms of surgery.
        However, the maxilla is an unusually complex symmetrical
        group of delicate bones in a unique association with
        teeth and air sinuses (air sinuses are a group of air-filled
        spaces, grouped around the nasal cavity).</li>
    <li>Oro-antral communication. An abnormal connection between
        the mouth and the maxillary air sinus (space above maxilla
        and below eye socket) is a well-recognised problem after
        tooth removal from the maxilla. If the communication
        becomes lined with epithelial cells (type of cells that
        covers body surfaces) it is called a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistula</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">Fracture</a> of the tooth
        bearing part of the maxilla (alveolar bone) during tooth
        removal. This may or may not create an oro-antral communication.</li>
    <li>Bleeding from multiple areas leaking into the air sinus.
        This creates a nosebleed. It is seen in people with
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">broken noses and cheekbones</a> and can also happen after
            surgery to repair these injuries.</li>
    <li>Nerves to the inside of the mouth and the skin of the cheek
        and nose run in bony tunnels in the maxilla. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>        in various parts of the mouth and face can result. The
        infraorbital nerve (sensory nerve, innervating the upper
        lip, parts of the nose and the lower eyelid) runs in
        the floor of the orbit which is also the roof of the
        maxillary air sinus.</li>
