<p>Immunotherapy is a fairly new approach for the treatment of malignancies,
    with many concepts and drugs still in the laboratory phase,
    or in transition from laboratory to pre-clinical trials,
    or some selected clinical trials in solid tumours such as
    lung cancer. For the treatment of head &amp; neck malignancies,
    there are no clinically evaluated and established drugs or
    treatment schemes at this point in time (2018). However,
    the whole approach of utilising the body’s <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune system</a>    to inhibit malignancies carries genuine promise. Accordingly,
    we discuss the approach in more detail and hope/expect that
    in the not too distant future the promise of finding selective
    immunotherapy treatments for malignancies without some of
    the major adverse effects of conventional treatments (
    <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>, <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>,
        <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>) and
        not introducing other adverse effects, will be realised.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the components and the functioning
        (and dysfunctions) of the immune system, this is described
        in our section on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Immunotherapy utilizes the immune system to inhibit the growth
    and/or spread of cancerous cells. There are different ways
    to achieve this: it can be an active or a passive approach.
    Whilst active immunotherapy requires a working immune system,
    passive immunotherapy can be used even if the immune system
    is significantly weakened.</p>
<p><strong>Active immunotherapy</strong> stimulates the immune system
    to recognise and attack malignant cells. Active immunotherapy
    creates an immunological memory and will thus have a lasting
    effect. Common forms of active immunotherapy include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>vaccines;</li>
    <li>checkpoint inhibitors (agents that block proteins that stop
        the immune system from attacking malignant cells; of
        most potential promise if this translates to the treatment
        of head &amp; neck cancer);</li>
    <li>adoptive cell transfer (transplantation of own or donated,
        genetically modified cells (mostly a particular type
        of white blood cells, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">T cells</a>,
        that form part of the immune system).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Passive immunotherapy</strong> provides the immune system
    with external supportive agents to use, but this means that
    no immunological memory is created and the treatment must
    be administered multiple times. The main form of passive
    immunotherapy is using monoclonal antibodies (an antibody
    that is derived from a single type of cell line and typically
    is specialised to interact with a particular type of antigen;
    the approach has been discussed for about 30 years but still
    awaits major break-through success in clinical use for the
    treatment of malignancies).</p>
<p>Malignancies, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">squamous cell carcinoma</a>    (the most common type of head &amp; neck cancers) have immunosuppressive
    properties (or, sometimes acquire such properties), so some
    immunotherapies tackle this suppression. The two main mechanisms
    that malignancies have for evading detection (and elimination)
    by the immune system are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to reduce the induction of an immune response (immunogenicity);</li>
    <li>to alter gene expression and hinder the production of some
        proteins that form part of the detection pathways that
        normally alert the immune system to the presence of invaders
        (in particular virus infections) or malignant cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Immunogenicity involves suppressing the signals of an immune
    response or sending ‘normal’ signals to immune checkpoints,
    therefore allowing malignant cells to ‘hide’ from the body’s
    inbuilt defence strategies.</p>
