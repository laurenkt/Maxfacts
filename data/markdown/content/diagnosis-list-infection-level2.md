<p>The theme ‘infection’ is very broad, it would fill a bulky book
    to deal in any detail just with infections relevant in the
    head &amp; neck region. Many of these infections and their
    treatment, for both hard and soft tissues, are described
    in detail in other sections of our website. We will point
    the reader to the relevant sections where appropriate.</p>
<p>Accurate diagnosis of infection is important both for treatment
    and public health management. Prompt identification of the
    organism causing infection enables the antimicrobial therapy
    to be specifically directed, which may allow rapid resolution
    of symptoms and minimises the opportunity for the development
    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">resistant strains of bacteria</a>.
    This requires careful collection of specimens, accurate labelling
    and adequate clinical details to allow the clinical microbiologist
    to carry out the appropriate <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">culture and sensitivity testing</a>.
    In modern clinical practice, especially in a maxillofacial
    context, treatment of most infections will start immediately
    based on a ‘best guess’ antibiotics choice, and if necessary
    can be adjusted or altered lateron. A specimen can be contaminated
    by normal microflora and, where possible, the sample should
    be obtained by sterile aspiration, rather than swabbing of
    the area or a ‘pure’ pus sample collected from a drained
    abscess. If anaerobic or specific infections, such as tuberculosis,
    are suspected then designated special sample containers should
    be used for sample transfer to the microbiology laboratory.
    Samples should be sent to the laboratory without delay to
    ensure that culture of any organisms, including strictly
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">anaerobic bacteria</a>,
    is possible.</p>
<p>Serology (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>)
    can be useful, particularly in the case of viral and mycoplasma
    infections. It may be possible to identify viral antigens
    in serum, but it is more common to measure serum antibodies.
    This can allow the demonstration of a rising antibody titre
    over several days and thus to monitor response to treatment
    over time. It can also allow for identification of previous
    exposure. Unfortunately, it is often an ‘after the event’
    diagnosis.</p>

<h1 id="bacterial-infections">Bacterial infections</h1>
<h2>Acute bacterial infections</h2>
<p><strong>Pericoronitis</strong> most commonly affects the lower
    third molars. During eruption, the tooth is covered by a
    flap of gingival (gum) tissue, the operculum. This can result
    in the formation of a pocket, which may act as a food trap
    and provide a favourable environment for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">anaerobic bacteria</a>.
    The flap can be traumatised by the opposing tooth and become
    inflamed. The most common symptom is pain associated with
    a partially erupted tooth. When the operculum is inflamed
    it may be possible to express pus or food debris from beneath
    the flap. The degree of systemic upset is variable. There
    may be <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> (difficulty
    opening the mouth), lymphadenopathy (swelling of the regional
    lymph nodes) and spread of infection to the adjacent <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">fascial spaces</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Alveolar osteitis (dry socket)</strong> occurs when there
    is loss of the healing blood clot formed at the time of tooth
    extraction. This results in a local osteitis (inflammation
    of the bone) of the extraction socket. It is characterised
    by a distinctive pain (often described as a toothache getting
    worse after the tooth has been removed) and an offensive
    smell; diagnosis and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry
    socket) are described in our sections about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone lesions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Acute periodontal disease</strong> (inflammation of soft
    and hard tissues supporting teeth) is much less common than
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">chronic periodontal disease</a>,
    which is universal. It is being seen much more frequently
    in people with impaired host defence mechanisms such as those
    with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection (see below).
    Acute periodontal disease tends to be an exacerbation of
    underlying chronic periodontal disease.</p>
<p><strong>Necrotising ulcerative gingivitis</strong> is a painful
    and typically spreading, unpleasant inflammation and ulceration
    of the gums. It is most commonly seen in people who smoke
    and have poor <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>.
    It may be more common at times of severe stress. Pain is
    a prominent feature and may prevent adequate intake of food
    and fluid. There is usually an offensive odour from the mouth
    and bleeding from the gingivae (gums) following minimal pressure.
    The interdental papillae (gums) are initially affected with
    the rest of the gingivae subsequently becoming involved (see
    Figure 1). There may be marked loss of periodontal support
    and consequent loss of teeth. Cancrum oris (noma) is an extreme
    form with marked soft tissue and bony destruction. It is
    thought that a mixed bacterial infection (spirochaete and
    fusiform) is the cause. It is particularly common in the
    horn of Africa region (for example, Ethiopia) where malnutrition
    and lack of access to simple <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterials</a>    such as metronidazole are an everyday problem.</p>

        (courtesy of Mr. R. F. Crosher)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>A dentoalveolar abscess</strong> is usually caused by
    oral microorganisms that reach the periapical tissues (ligament,
    bone and other tissue near the apex of a tooth root) via
    the root canal system or via the periodontal ligament. If
    the bacteria are sufficiently virulent and/or the host defences
    compromised, then the infection may give rise to a dentoalveolar
    abscess.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Diagnosis and treatment of simple, localised abscesses as
        well as severe conditions (such as Ludwig’s angina or
        necrotising fasciitis) are described on our pages about
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess / diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/abscess">abscess / treatment</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>A dentoalveolar abscess may remain localised or may spread giving
    rise to a severe cellulitis involving multiple tissue spaces
    (see Figure 2). The specific signs and symptoms depend on
    which tissue spaces are involved. A variety of organisms
    are involved in these infections. There is an increasing
    recognition of the role of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">anaerobic bacteria</a>,
    especially <i>streptococci</i>, in these infections.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Top left: a simple localised dental
        abscess; top right: an abscess affecting the submandibular
        and lateral pharyngeal spaces (below the jaw, to the

        A <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scan</a> image
        of the temporal space abscess.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Infections of the anterior maxilla (front of the upper jaw) may,
    rarely, give rise to cavernous sinus thrombosis (formation
    of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus, a cavity at the
    base of the brain), a condition which still has a mortality
    of 30 % in spite of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotic therapy</a>.
    The signs of cavernous sinus thrombosis include proptosis
    (bulging of the eye), chemosis (swelling of the eyelid),
    impaired eye movements (ophthalmoplegia) and marked systemic
    upset.</p>
<p>Acute <strong>osteomyelitis</strong> is an inflammation of bone
    of infective origin.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Diagnosis and treatment of osteomyelitis are described on
        our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone lesions / diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion">bone lesions / treatment</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The oral cavities of all animals, including humans, are full
    of bacteria. Any <strong>bite wounds</strong> therefore are
    inoculated with significant numbers of bacteria. This predisposes
    to infection, particularly if there is a significant injury.
    The <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">infecting organisms</a>    depend on the source of the bite. The most common isolates
    from infected dog and cat bites are <i>pasteurella</i> species<i>, streptococci, staphylococci, moraxella, neisseria</i>    and anaerobes such as <i>fusobacteria</i> and <i>bacteroides.</i>    The most common isolates from human bites are <i>staphylococcus aureus, eikenella, haemophilus influenza</i>    and beta-lactamase producing oral anaerobes.</p>
<p><strong>Acute salivary gland infections</strong> (see Figure
    3 for an example of an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>    of the parotid gland), diagnosis and treatment, are described
    on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems / diagnosis</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems / treatment</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Parotid abscess.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Impetigo</strong> is a spreading bacterial infection
    of the superficial layers of the epidermis (outer layer of
    skin), usually caused by beta-haemolytic <i>streptococci</i>    or coagulase-positive <i>staphylococci</i>. It frequently
    follows minor tissue trauma such as scratching of the skin.
    Initially there are thin-walled pustules, which spread rapidly
    circumferentially and burst leaving a crusting wound.</p>
<p><strong>Erysipelas</strong> is a superficial cellulitis involving
    the dermis (thick and dense inner layer of skin) and is most
    commonly caused by beta-haemolytic <i>streptococci</i>. The
    lesions spread rapidly and systemic upset is common. Desquamation
    (shedding of the outer layer) of the skin following resolution
    of the infection may occur.</p>
<p><strong>Furuncles and carbuncles</strong> belong to a variety
    of conditions caused by staphylococcal infections of hair
    follicles. Localised superficial infection of a hair follicle
    is known as folliculitis. If abscess formation occurs, this
    is known as a furuncle or boil. These are very painful and
    may require drainage if they do not spontaneously discharge.
    Multiple adjacent follicles can be involved and if these
    coalesce this is known as a carbuncle. A furuncle localised
    to an eyelash is known as stye. These infections frequently
    recur because of a reservoir of <i>staphylococcus aureus</i>    in the nares (nostrils), and eradication of this reservoir
    is important. Sebaceous and acne <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>    may become similarly infected.</p>
<p><strong>Cat scratch disease</strong> is caused by <i>bartonella henselae</i>,
    formerly called <i>rochalimaea henselae</i>. The infection
    is usually self-limiting, but may last weeks to months. <i>Afipia felis</i>    has also appeared to be involved in causation. Regional or
    solitary lymphadenitis (swelling of lymph nodes) is seen
    at or near the site of the injury, sometimes with erythematous
    (red) skin papules. Fever, malaise, and other constitutional
    symptoms may also occur. In immunocompromised people the
    infection can disseminate and cause a serious systemic illness.</p>
<p>Only some people recall and report a cat scratch; it is likely
    that the identical illness can be caused by other animals
    and even by splinters and thorns bearing the causative organisms.
    Cats are rarely the carrier. Appropriate <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">serology testing</a>    may aid in the diagnosis and management of the infection.</p>
<h2>Chronic bacterial infections</h2>
<p>There are recurrent (especially in children) and <strong>chronic forms of bacterial infections of the salivary glands</strong>;
    these are described on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems / diagnosis</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland problems / treatment</a>.</p>
<p>There is a wide and bewildering range of <strong>chronic bacterial (and non-bacterial) forms of osteomyelitis</strong>;
    these conditions are described on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">bone lesions / diagnosis</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion">bone lesions / treatment</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Actinomycosis</strong> is an infection caused by <i>actinomyces israelii</i>,
    a common oral commensal (normally non-harmful) bacterium
    which can, if inoculated into deeper tissues, cause disease.
    It may be inoculated during trauma such as tooth extraction
    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fracture of the mandible</a>.
    Actinomycosis rarely presents as an acute soft tissue swelling
    (similar to a dental abscess). Pain may be less of a feature
    than in a simple odontogenic (tooth related) infection. It
    more frequently presents as a slowly progressive mass, which
    may not be painful (see Figure 4).  </p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Clinical presentation of actinomycosis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Suppuration (oozing of pus) can occur via multiple tracts. These
    may resolve, only to recur later. Bone involvement is characterised
    by deep-seated pain, low-grade pyrexia (fever) and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">paraesthesia</a>    (disturbed sensation).</p>
<p>Serial <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiographs</a> may show
    variable areas of destruction with variable amounts of bone
    deposition. Diagnosis is by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">culture</a>    of any pus present or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>    of the involved tissue. <i>Actinomyces</i> are fastidious
    (fussy) anaerobes and careful, prolonged anaerobic culture
    needs to be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. Actinomycosis
    is increasingly thought to be associated with a specific,
    medication-related form of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrosis of the jaw bone</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology"><strong>Mycobacterial infections</strong></a>,
    both tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial infection have
    become more prevalent in recent years. They are seen in homeless,
    in chronically malnourished and in immunocompromised people,
    particularly those with HIV infection. Atypical mycobacterial
    cervical lymphadenitis (inflammation and swelling of neck
    lymph nodes) is seen regularly in otherwise healthy children.</p>
<p>Maxillofacial manifestations of tuberculosis include cervical
    (neck) lymphadenopathy (in which the lymph nodes may coalesce
    and give rise to a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">discharging sinus</a>),
    chronic <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">oral ulcers</a>,
    typically of the tongue (see Figure 5) and rarely <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">osteomyelitis</a>.
    Diagnosis can be difficult and may require multiple <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">bacterial cultures</a>,
    skin testing, chest <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray imaging</a>    and occasionally <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Fissured, ulcerated tongue in
        a patient with tuberculosis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is of immense importance not to confuse the quite common cervical
    lymphadenopathy of atypical mycobacterial infections (<i>mycobacterium avian-intracellulare complex</i>,
    <i>mycobacterium</i> <i>kansasii</i>, <i>mycobacterium</i>    <i>marinarum</i>) with tuberculosis. These atypical mycobacterial
    infections do not respond to anti-tuberculosis therapy, rarely
    show any of the other manifestations of tuberculosis, and
    are treated quite differently.</p>
<p>Atypical mycobacteria, such as <i>mycobacterium aviium-intracellularae</i>    (and many others) may give rise to an isolated, occasionally
    discharging cervical mass in children (sometimes called a
    ‘scrofula’ or ‘the king’s evil’: it was believed in the middle
    ages that the condition could be cured by the touch of the
    king; see Figure 6) Diagnosis is by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">culture and microscopy</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Cervical lymphadenopathy in a
        child caused by an atypical <i>mycobacterium</i> infection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Syphilis</strong> is a sexually transmitted infection
    that may have oral manifestations at any point in its natural
    history. It is caused by the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">spirochaete bacterium treponema pallidum</a>.</p>
<p>In primary syphilis there is a painless ulcer, known as a chancre,
    at the site of entry of the infection. This might be at an
    intraoral site, with the lip, tongue and gingivae (gums)
    the most common areas. Chancres are highly infectious and
    may persist for up to a month. Approximately six weeks later
    secondary syphilis may present intraorally as ‘snail-track’
    ulcers of the mucous membrane (lining tissue of the mouth).
    The infection may become latent for 5 to 10 years. The classic
    lesion of tertiary syphilis is the gumma (a rubbery, soft
    growth), which may affect the palate, lips and tongue. Considerable
    destruction may occur. There can be an associated glossitis
    (inflammation of the tongue) which may be premalignant (risk
    of developing a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">malignant lesion</a>).</p>
<p>Syphilis infection <i>in utero</i> (of the unborn) gives rise
    to congenital syphilis.  As a result, there may be hypoplasia
    (underdevelopment) of the permanent teeth giving rise to
    notched, peg-shaped incisors (Hutchinson’s incisors) and
    rounded first permanent molars (mulberry molars). Gumma formation
    may cause collapse of the nasal complex and a ‘saddle nose’
    deformity. Diagnosis is by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">serology</a>.</p>
<h1 id="viral-infections">Viral infections</h1>
<h2>Acute viral infections</h2>
<p><strong>Mumps</strong> is caused by a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">RNA paramyxovirus</a>.
    It is most commonly seen in childhood. It is characterised
    by a painful swelling of the salivary glands, particularly
    the parotid. It is usually bilateral. There is frequently
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> (difficulty
    opening the mouth) and halitosis (bad breath). Although mumps
    is usually self- limiting complications can occur, especially
    in adults. These include orchitis (inflammation of the testicles),
    meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the membranes of the
    brain and adjoining cerebral tissue), myocarditis (inflammation
    of the heart muscle) and nephritis (inflammation of the kidneys).</p>
<p><strong>Epstein-Barr virus infection</strong> most commonly presents
    as infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). It is transmitted
    by contaminated saliva. It is also associated with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">nasopharyngeal carcinoma</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">lymphoma</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">hairy leukoplakia</a>.
    Infectious mononucleosis is most commonly seen in adolescents
    and young adults and presents as malaise, sore throat and
    cervical lymphadenopathy. There may be an associated hepatosplenomegaly
    (enlargement of liver and spleen). Intraoral examination
    may show multiple petechiae (red spots from bleeding in the
    skin; see Figure 7). The condition is self limiting. In Germany
    it is sometimes referred to as ‘Pfeiffer’s disease’ and in
    many countries ‘kissing disease’ because of the mode of transmission.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Palatal petechiae in infectious
        mononucleosis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Cytomegalovirus</strong> infection may present as
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">mucosal ulceration</a> or salivary gland swelling in people
        who are immunocompromised. Diagnosis may require <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>        of the affected tissue and special <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">staining of the specimen</a>.</p>
<h2>Chronic viral infections</h2>
<p><strong>Herpes virus infections</strong> are infections caused
    by a group of DNA viruses and are all characterised by a
    capacity for latent infection and subsequent reactivation,
    particularly at times of stress or immunocompromise. The
    herpes virus family (human herpes virus) include: herpes
    simplex, varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus
    and Kaposi’s sarcoma virus.</p>
<p><strong>Herpes simplex</strong> infection is the most common
    herpes infection, with most people exposed to it by puberty.
    Most initial exposures are symptomatic. Primary infection
    can be manifest as a gingivostomatitis (painful gum inflammation),
    with vesicles, ulcers and oropharyngeal (sore mouth and throat)
    pain (see Figure 8).  </p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Herpetic gingivostomatitis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is often misnamed as ‘teething’ in children, primary infection
    tends to be more troublesome if it occurs in adult life.
    Treatment of the initial infection is symptomatic. Following
    the initial infection, the virus travels to the regional
    ganglia (clusters of nerve cells that form part of the sensory
    and <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">autonomous nervous system</a>).
    From here reactivation is common. In the maxillofacial region
    these reactivations are seen as mucosal (lining of the mouth)
    and labial infections (cold sores, canker sores). A prodrome
    (early symptom) of tingling is common. These lesions are
    uncomfortable, unsightly and highly contagious. Diagnosis
    is usually clinical although <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">viral culture and cytology</a>    are possible. The infection is transferable to the genitals
    and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>Primary <strong>varicella-zoster infection</strong> gives rise
    to chickenpox. This is a common contagious disease of children.
    The symptoms are fever, malaise and a rash, which spreads
    rapidly from the trunk to the head, neck and extremities.
    The rash gives way to vesicles and papules. These can involve
    the oral cavity and make eating and drinking difficult. The
    infection tends to be self-limiting and complications such
    as pneumonia and encephalitis are uncommon.</p>
<p>The varicella-zoster virus remains latent in the sensory ganglia
    and it may reactivate in later life or if someone becomes
    immunocompromised. This is known as herpes zoster or shingles.
    Following a painful initial period, vesicles appear which
    typically have a dermatomal distribution along the divisions
    of the trigeminal nerve (see Figure 9). The vesicles typically
    heal over a three week period. Pre-, peri- and post-herpetic
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">neuralgic pain</a>    is common and troublesome.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-infection-level2-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Top: herpes zoster infection showing
        dermatome distribution; bottom: intraoral herpes zoster
        infection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are a number of viral infections with potential for complicating
    surgical treatments. <strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is one
    of several viral infections which can complicate surgical
    treatment. The hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus which can
    be spread by sexual contact or inoculation, particularly
    in association with intravenous drug abuse. It can be present
    in saliva as well as in all other bodily fluids. There is
    a long incubation period, so unwitting infection as a result
    of inoculation during surgical treatment can occur. This
    is why the use of universal precautions is so important.
    Signs and symptoms of hepatitis B infection include: malaise,
    abdominal discomfort, anorexia and jaundice. Diagnosis is
    by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">serology</a>, with
    detection of the surface antigen (HbsAg) indicating current
    infection. Liver function tests will show elevation of the
    enzymes of the transaminase series. Chronic infection with
    persistence of the infectious state occurs in approximately
    5 % of cases. The development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular
    carcinoma can complicate infection. A vaccine against Hepatitis
    B is available and all healthcare workers should avail themselves
    of it.</p>
<p><strong>Hepatitis C</strong> is an increasing public health problem.
    Transmission is similar to hepatitis B infection although
    hepatitis C is arguably even more easily transmissible, with
    the highest rate of infection among intravenous drug users.
    There is no vaccine currently available although some promising
    treatments have recently been developed. Approximately 20
    % of infected people will develop cirrhosis and may require
    liver transplantation.</p>
<p>There are approximately 34 million people world-wide living with
    the <strong>human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</strong>,
    a blood borne RNA virus which is spread by sexual contact,
    or by inoculation with infected blood or blood products.
    It can complicate oral and maxillofacial surgical treatment
    both because of the cross infection risk and because of the
    oral infection manifestations, some of which may be the first
    manifestations of the condition and may lead to the diagnosis
    being made. There is a 2 to 6 week incubation period followed
    by an episode of flu-like illness. There is then usually
    a period of persistent generalised lymphadenopathy before
    the disease enters its latent phase, which may last several
    years. During the latent phase there is an increase in the
    viral load and reduction of the CD4 lymphocyte count. Eventually,
    if untreated with combination <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">anti-retroviral drugs</a>,
    the lymphocyte reduction will give rise to symptoms and the
    development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
    The availability of treatment in various countries and sectors
    of the world is one of the distinguishing features of the
    disease in modern times.</p>
<p>Oral conditions associated with HIV/AIDS include: oropharyngeal
    candidiasis (see below), <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">hairy leukoplakia</a>    (see Figure 10), Kaposi’s sarcoma (lesions of the skin or
    oral mucosa), necrotising gingivitis (see above), periodontitis
    (see above) and the development of carcinomas or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">lymphomas</a>    (usually Non-Hodgkin’s type) and enlargement of the parotid
    glands.</p>

<p>Infected patients who have reached a stage of significant immunocompromise
    (extremely rare nowadays in the developed world) may present
    with severe dentofacial <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a>.
    The removal of the source of infection may be difficult but
    is essential. Patients with HIV/AIDS are at risk of bacterial
    infection during treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics should
    be used. Universal precautions should be used to prevent
    transmission of infection but this is hardly unique to HIV.</p>
<h1 id="fungal-infections">Fungal infections</h1>
<h2>Acute fungal infections</h2>
<p><strong>Candidiasis</strong> (sometimes referred to as candidosis)
    infection is caused by candida, a yeast-like fungus commonly
    found in the oral cavity. <i>Candida albicans</i> is most
    commonly cultured and associated with disease. It is more
    commonly isolated in smokers, in people with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>    and those on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">broad-spectrum antibiotics</a>    or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">steroids</a>,
    particularly inhaled steroids. Underlying systemic disease
    such as diabetes can predispose patients to systemic candidiasis.
    Candidiasis is sometimes known as the disease of the diseased.</p>
<p>Symptoms include discomfort (often described as burning), altered
    taste and altered smell. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">Dysphagia</a>    (difficulty swallowing) may be present in oral candidiasis.
    Pseudomembrane formation is common (see Figure 11) and is
    characterised by the fact that the plaque can be removed
    by rubbing, leaving a bleeding site.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Candidiasis secondary to oral
        steroid inhaler use.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An erythematous form may be seen in which painful red areas are
    present in the absence of plaques. A hyperplastic form may
    be seen in denture wearers, as may angular cheilitis (inflamed
    fissures in the corners of the mouth) in which an associated
    <i>staphylococcus aureus</i> infection may be present. The
    hyperplastic form of candidiasis if candida hyphae are seen
    microscopically to invade the soft tissues may give rise
    to a possibly <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">premalignant leukoplakia</a>.</p>
<p>Diagnosis is largely clinical. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">Culture</a>    alone cannot be relied upon as <i>candida</i> is a common
    commensal microorganism. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">Biopsy</a>    confirmation may be required in cases of hyperplastic candidiasis.
    There are less common <i>candida</i> strains (<i>candida dublensii</i>)
    which are resistant to standard antifungal treatments.</p>
