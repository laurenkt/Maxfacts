<p>Nearly all the gelling, thickening and emulsifying ingredients
    are obtained from plant materials, only gelatin is made from
    animal collagen (pork, cattle, chicken, fish). Nearly all
    these agents with the ability to alter the texture of foods
    do so by similar mechanisms but to different degrees: in
    all cases very large molecules (usually made up from many
    interconnected sugar molecules) alter the way in which water
    molecules can move around. In a typical liquid, the water
    molecules are fairly free to move around but in the presence
    of these huge molecules the movement of the water molecules
    is more restricted and as a result the liquid can thicken,
    solidify or form a jelly, depending on the type and amount
    of gelling agent, temperature and composition of the liquid.</p>
<p>The most familiar gelling agents probably are gelatin, agar and
    carrageenan (commonly called vegetarian gelatin). Familiar
    thickening agents in the home kitchen are corn flour (gravy
    thickener) and pectin (in jam sugar). In addition there are
    several other gelling and thickening ingredients with interesting
    properties giving a range of slightly different food textures.
    In fact, here we follow the footsteps of some high-end Michelin-starred
    cuisines where professional chefs often take advantage of
    these ingredients.</p>
<h1 id="gelatin">Gelatin</h1>
<p>Gelatin is different from all other gelling agents as it is made
    from animal collagen. Collagen consists of well-ordered polymeric
    chains of proteins (see Figure 1). Collagen is the most abundant
    protein in the human body in connective tissues (tendons,
    ligaments, skin, cartilage, blood vessels) varying from rigid
    to compliant structures. Its role is to give a certain elasticity
    to tissues and ensure smooth operation of joints in living
    creatures. Isolating collagen and heating it breaks down
    the ordered polymeric chains into a conglomerate of disordered
    chaotic polymeric chains.</p>

        gelatin.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this form (now called gelatin) it can take up large quantities
    of water molecules. The two main building blocks of gelatin
    are aspartic acid and lysine (see Figure 2). Both of these
    molecules have several polar (‘sticky’) groups that can interact
    with (hold on to) water molecules.</p>

        components of gelatin.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 3 illustrates how water molecules attach to the polar
    groups and thus get taken up in the polymeric network. This
    process is called swelling.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers/figure3.png">

        molecules by the gelatin polymer matrix.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Gelatin is a gelling agent (E441) which can also be used to stabilise
    foams and mousses (see <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">recipes</a>    and <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">cooking videos</a>).
    It is available in sheet and powder form.</p>
<p>Gelatin-based jellies melt around 35°C (ca. body temperature),
    so need to be set in the fridge (at temperatures below 15°C);
    it takes several hours to set.</p>
<p>The low melting point of gelatin-based jellies is the most beneficial
    aspect with regard to ease of swallowing (these jellies literally
    melt in the mouth / throat and have a particularly smooth
    texture). In addition gelatin does not distort the flavour
    of foods. Gelatin-based jellies last usually for several
    days in the fridge before they start leaking liquid (water)
    / separating. Presence of sugar, acids or alcohol may slightly
    alter the firmness of set. Gelatin-based jellies cannot be
    frozen and thawed. Gelatin works with just about all liquids
    (with the exception of raw pineapple and papaya juice, both
    contain enzymes that prevent the gelatin from setting the
    liquid – the same mechanism that helps making sticky saliva
    less sticky when munching on pineapple junks). Gelatin is
    a particularly robust and forgiving gelling agent. Powdered
    gelatin is most convenient to precisely adjust the wanted
    firmness of set. This is of practical importance because
    wobbly, softly set gelatin-based jellies have viscoelastic
    properties that make them good <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubricants for other foods</a>.</p>
<p>Using gelatin (powder and sheets) to produce jellies is demonstrated
    in our <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">cooking videos</a>    and there is a collection of recipes for gelatin-based jellies
    in the <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">Maxfacts cookbook</a>    alongside a number of further recipes making use of gelatin
    for the production of smooth and slippery foods (such as
    mousses).</p>
<h1 id="thickeners-and-gelling-agents-from-plant-materials">Thickeners and gelling agents from plant materials</h1>
<p>A wide variety of thickening and gelling agents is obtained from
    a wide range of plant materials, many of which are very large,
    complicated concatenated poly-sugar molecules (polysaccharides).
    Many of these agents have long-standing traditional uses
    in cuisines all over the world. Figure 4 shows four representatives
    of plant-derived food thickeners and gelling agents together
    with their basic chemical building blocks.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers/figure4.png">

        agents extracted from plants.</figcaption>

<h2>Corn (or potato) starch, arrow root</h2>
<p>These are all commonly used ingredients in western cuisines for
    thickening of sauces and soups. They need to be suspended
    in some liquid and the suspension slowly added to the boiling
    liquid while stirring well. They tend to form lumps unless
    vigorously stirred but permit very good control of adjustment
    to a particular degree of thickness for many different liquids
    (provided the liquid can be heated to boiling point). All
    of the above may be less suitable as thickening agents when
    dealing with dry mouth problems owing to the resulting texture.</p>
<p>Figure 5 illustrates how all of the thickening and gelling agents
    derived from polymeric sugars (such as starch in corn flour)
    in principle can attract and accommodate large quantities
    of water molecules in between the polymer chains. Since the
    basic building blocks of all these polymers vary slightly,
    also the resulting properties and interactions with water
    molecules will vary slightly. That, in turn, is very useful
    as a wide selection of thickeners and gelling agents thus
    gives us a very finely tuned handle on the texture of foods.
    This is vital when catering for the needs of people with
    dysphagia (maxillofacial patients and others) as many will
    have a narrowly defined window of manageable textures (and
    temperatures) of foods.</p>

        by starch polymers, such as in corn flour.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Pectin</h2>
<p>Pectin is obtained from various fruits and plants (for example
    apples and peel of citrus fruit; see Figure 4). It is a well-known
    household gelling agent (E440) widely used in jam making,
    or in the production of jelly beans. Its gelling effect requires
    high sugar content in a (at least) slightly acidic environment,
    perfect for jam making. Pectin produces stable jellies that
    can be frozen and thawed.</p>
<h2>Guar gum</h2>
<p>Guar gum is made from guar beans (E412; see Figure 4). It is
    a stabiliser and thickener, widely used in commercial foods.
    It works similarly to starch in corn or potato flour (see
    Figure 5) but is a more powerful thickening agent that only
    requires small quantities to be added to a liquid. It may
    be a more suitable thickener for those afflicted by dry mouth.
    Guar gum can also act as a gelling agent but only in the
    presence of calcium ions (such as in dairy products).</p>
<h2>Methylcellulose</h2>
<p>Various types of methylcellulose exist, they are all obtained
    from plant fibres (cellulose), often from the cotton plant
    (E461; see Figure 4). Methylcellulose is a gelling agent
    and potent foam stabiliser. Depending on the particular fraction
    used, firm gels form at elevated temperatures (ca. 50-80°C),
    set rapidly and melt in the mouth. At room temperature small
    quantities of pre-swelled methylcellulose added to a liquid
    (together with some thickener such as xanthan gum, see below),
    combined with vigorous whisking of the liquid, produce stable
    foams (‘tasty air’). Such foams can act as appetisers that
    do not require active swallowing but can provide taste stimulation
    from many different strongly flavoured liquids.</p>
<h1 id="thickeners-and-gelling-agents-from-algae-and-sea-weeds">Thickeners and gelling agents from algae and sea weeds</h1>
<p>A range of algae and sea weeds are a rich resource for the isolation
    of (mostly) different gelling agents. Figure 6 shows three
    selected examples together with their chemical signatures.
    As they also consist of polymeric sugar molecules they work
    in similar ways to all the other related agents (see Figure
    5).</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers/figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Some selected thickening and gelling
        agents extracted from algae and sea weeds.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Agar</h2>
<p>Agar is obtained from seaweed, a gelling agent (E406). It is
    usually sold in powder form in many supermarkets and Asian
    food stores (traditional ingredient in Asian cuisine).</p>
<p>Agar-based jellies are produced by heating it in the liquid to
    nearly boiling point, the jelly then sets rapidly on cooling.
    Agar produces firm, slightly brittle jellies that can be
    cut into shape at room temperature. The jellies are fairly
    stable at higher temperatures, so can be gentle re-heated
    and served hot. Agar-based jellies cannot be frozen and thawed.
    Agar jellies do not keep well but start leaking water after
    a short while.</p>
<h2>Carrageenan</h2>
<p>Carrageenan is obtained from red algae (Irish moss), a gelling
    agent (E407, E407a). It is the usual vegetarian alternative
    to gelatin. Carrageenan has been used for centuries in China,
    Ireland and Scotland (for example, according to some local
    Scottish traditions seaweed is boiled in milk, strained,
    flavouring (whisky…) added to the liquid and set aside to
    cool, yielding a variety of milk jelly).</p>
<p>Different fractions of carrageenan exist (Iota – gives soft gels,
    requires presence of calcium ions to work, so naturally works
    well with dairy products; Kappa – gives firm gels but requires
    presence of potassium ions to work (usually already added
    to commercial ‘vegetarian gelatin’; Lambda – acts as a thickener
    for dairy products, this fraction is usually not contained
    in ‘vegetarian gelatin’).</p>
<p>Carrageenan-based jellies cannot be heated but can be frozen
    and thawed. Especially jellies made with the Iota fraction
    have interesting mouthfeel properties: they tend to slightly
    liquefy when shaken, stirred or chewed (a bit like ketchup)
    and in this way give the impression of a silky texture in
    the mouth and may ease swallowing. The Kappa fraction gives
    a silky mouthfeel similar to that of tofu. Carrageenan jellies
    set rapidly on cooling but only work with liquids that can
    be heated to boiling point.</p>
<p>The use of carrageenan to produce jellies is not quite as robust
    as the use of gelatin and the firmness of set is slightly
    more difficult to predict but carrageenan-based jellies broaden
    the range of properties beyond those based on gelatin (and,
    of course, may be more acceptable to vegetarians and are
    halal and kosher as well). We demonstrate the use of carrageenan
    in our <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">cooking videos</a>.</p>
<h2>Alginates</h2>
<p>Alginates are obtained from brown algae, they are a range of
    gelling and gum-forming agents (E400-E404). You may have
    come across sodium alginate as the main ingredient in some
    well-known heart-burn remedies. Alginates are commonly used
    as food thickeners in the food industry. As gelling agents
    they yield firm, brittle and heat-stable jellies. Alginates
    are popular in so called molecular cuisine where one can
    use their properties to prepare unusual foods and food textures,
    such as wobbly jelly spheres containing a liquid core.</p>
<h1 id="thickeners-and-gelling-agents-from-fermentation-processes">Thickeners and gelling agents from fermentation processes</h1>
<p>Some of the most powerful thickening and gelling agents, widely
    used in the food industry as well as in high-end gastronomy,
    are obtained as a by-product of bacterial sugar fermentation.
    Figure 7 shows two representatives of this class of texture
    modifying agents, well worth to try out at home, they are
    easy to use!</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers/figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Both gellan gum (left) and xanthan
        gum (right) are by-products of bacterial sugar fermentation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Gellan gum</h2>
<p>Gellan gum is a by-product of sugar fermentation (E418), a powerful
    gelling agent that is widely used in the food industry. Small
    concentrations of gellan gum form typically elastic jellies
    that are particularly good at releasing flavours. Robust
    whisking of these jellies produces so called liquid gels
    – liquids that are perfectly smooth and can be poured but
    still maintain most of the properties of a gel rather than
    a simple liquid. These unusual food textures are definitely
    under-researched as far as their potential benefits for dysphagia
    sufferers are concerned. Gellan-based jellies are easy to
    cut once set and thus are particularly suitable as slippery
    ‘finger food’.</p>
<h2>Xanthan gum</h2>
<p>Xanthan gum is another by-product of fermentation (E415), a powerful
    thickener and stabiliser. It works with a very wide range
    of hot and cold liquids. Small quantities of xanthan gum
    swell liquids to a jelly-like consistency (fluid gels) maintaining
    the viscosity even when heated. Xanthan-based gels typically
    have a pleasant mouth feel because xanthan gum can also act
    as an emulsifier (widely exploited, for example in the preparation
    of commercial ice cream). In addition, xanthan gum can stabilise
    many food preparations, for example <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">foams</a>.</p>
<h1 id="lecithin">Lecithin</h1>
<p>Lecithin represents a group of compounds usually extracted from
    egg yolks or soy beans (E322). Lecithin is a highly effective
    emulsifier, it belongs to a class of compounds with so called
    amphiphilic properties, that is these compounds are attracted
    both by water and by fatty compounds (more specifically,
    these are all phospholipids). Because of this dual attraction
    of lecithin to otherwise immiscible phases, emulsifiers such
    as lecithin give foods a particularly silky and comfortable
    texture (and help paint particles to remain suspended in
    wall paint, or prevent commercial salad cream from splitting
    while sitting on the shelf in the supermarket, etc.). The
    resulting lubricating property of lecithin, together with
    its similarity to some components of natural saliva, is fully
    explained in our detailed pages about <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubrication of foods</a>.
    With lecithin being a natural component of egg yolks, egg
    yolks can easily be used as a natural emulsifying agent in
    home cooking (think of proper homemade custard or baked custards
    / flans; recipes can be found in the <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">Maxfacts cookbook</a>    and we demonstrate the preparation of <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">custard and baked custard in cooking videos</a>).</p>
<p>Lecithin powders can be used with a wide range of hot or cold
    liquids and purees and may also be used to stabilise foams.
    In order to produce a stable emulsion, lecithin must first
    be dissolved in the water phase, and the fatty / oily phase
    is added step by step in small quantities while whisking
    the mixture constantly (the secret of making mayonnaise…).</p>
