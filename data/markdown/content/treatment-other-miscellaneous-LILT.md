<p>Low intensity light therapy, LILT, also known as low
    intensity laser therapy, LLLT, has been rebranded as
    photobiomodulation. The renaming aimed at finding a more
    precise and less misleading term (for example, light
    emitting diodes (LEDs) are increasingly used instead of
    lasers, and there is lack of definition of the meaning
    of the term ‘low level’). Photobiomodulation describes a
    variety of phototherapy that is designed to stimulate
    wound healing and tissue regeneration, amongst numerous
    other suggested applications.</p>
<p>The ideas supporting photobiomodulation relate to the
    known biological effects of photons (light) of distinct
    wavelengths on living matter (Figure 1). For example,
    visible light is important in regulating the circadian
    rhythm and sleep / alertness patterns; a specific range
    of ultraviolet radiation (in sunshine) is necessary for
    the biosynthesis of vitamin D (hence known as the
    sunshine vitamin) but ultraviolet radiation is also
    responsible for the ageing of skin and the development
    of <a href="/diagnosis-list-skin-cancer-level1">skin
        malignancies</a>. Photobiomodulation employs
    radiation in the visible red light to near-infrared
    range (Figure 1), photons with such wavelengths can be
    produced by <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">lasers</a>
    or light emitting diodes, LEDs. Radiation in this
    wavelength region has been shown to penetrate skin and
    other tissues.</p>

        near infrared radiation located toward the lower
        energy region.</figcaption>

<p>In order for irradiation to have any physiological
    effects, it is necessary that a particular wavelength of
    irradiation is absorbed by some component / molecules in
    cells. For the wavelengths used in photobiomodulation,
    it is thought that the responding units are located in
    the cellular mitochondria (subunits in most cells,
    involved in energy production and release, <i>via</i>
    respiration). Specifically, it is thought that the
    copper ions in a large protein complex (cytochrome c
    oxidase; a vital part of the processing of oxygen
    molecules at the cell membrane level) are the
    chromophores responsive at these wavelengths.
    Accordingly, it should be expected that cells with high
    levels of mitochondria and related metabolic activities
    should be responsive to photobiomoduation (skin cells
    have low levels of mitochondria). It is not entirely
    clear how photobiomodulation appears to affect mainly
    damaged cells and tissues; some hypotheses about this
    await confirmation (or rejection).</p>
<p>There is a lack of systematic studies in the literature,
    the exact nature of the causes of experimentally
    observed increased cell proliferation remains unclear.
    It is not known if the effects are photothermal,
    photochemical or photomechanical in nature. Whilst some
    rodent-model studies demonstrate improvements in the
    healing of surgical wounds, the effects are not
    reproduced on pig skin (much more similar to human
    skin). Similarly, beneficial effects on superficial
    wound healing in humans reported in small-scale
    observational studies were not confirmed in larger
    studies.</p>
<p>Roughly in line with the predictions of the assumed
    mitochondrial activation mechanisms at work (increasing
    the release of growth factors, for example), in the
    laboratory low doses of photobiomodulation irradiation
    have been shown to enhance the proliferation (growth
    rate) of endothelial cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and
    keratinocytes. Leading to enhanced <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">vascularisation
        and angiogenesis</a> as well as increasing <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/collagen">collagen</a>
    production, one might thus expect that
    photobiomodulation could have a beneficial effect on the
    healing of acute or chronic wounds. It should also be
    kept in mind that increasing angiogenesis is not at all
    desirable in the context of malignant growth, and
    questions as to the safety of photobiomodulation in
    those circumstances have been raised repeatedly. A very
    recent study finds no evidence that photobiomodulation
    has effects on overall and disease-free survival times,
    and time to local recurrences in patients with head and
    neck malignancies treated with radio- or
    chemoradiotherapy.</p>
<p>This is a relevant point because photobiomodulation has
    been reported in attempts to prevent and/or treat <a href="/treatment/surgery/oral-mucosal-lesions/detailed">oral
        mucositis</a> and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">mucosal
        necrosis</a> occurring during and after <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>
    treatment applied to the head and neck region. The
    results of the mostly small observational studies are
    inconclusive and at best there is weak evidence for
    slightly faster healing. Photobiomodulation has been
    suggested as an adjuvant therapy for a number of
    maxillofacial conditions, including various <a href="/diagnosis-list-neuropathies-lvel1">neuropathic
        pain syndromes</a>, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">oral
        lichen planus</a>, <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal
        disease</a> and postoperative management following
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth/detailed">third
        molar surgery</a>. In all of these cases there is no
    robust evidence for the efficacy of photobiomodulation
    treatments provided by mostly poor-quality studies.</p>
