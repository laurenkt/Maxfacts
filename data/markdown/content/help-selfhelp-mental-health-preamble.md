<p>The homepage of maxfacts states that we are aiming to
    provide information about <i>all</i> aspects of oral and
    maxillofacial surgery. We would fall short of this aim
    if we would exclude from the website mental health
    issues, relevant in the context of oral and
    maxillofacial conditions.</p>
<p>Oral and maxillofacial conditions vary widely, and so do
    the corresponding aspects of mental health. Mental
    health issues stretch from common anxieties about minor
    treatments all the way to severe depression as a
    consequence of serious and life-changing illness, and
    there may be overlap where mental health issues generate
    or exacerbate oral and maxillofacial symptoms. Mental
    health issues and ways to avoid distress further unite
    all stakeholders – patients, friends and family, carers,
    and clinicians.</p>
<p>Our pages on mental health discuss the whole breadth of
    such issues in the context of oral and maxillofacial
    surgery, and in particular aim to promote and facilitate
    self-help by raising awareness and mutual understanding
    (where self-help strategies do include seeking
    professional support).  </p>
