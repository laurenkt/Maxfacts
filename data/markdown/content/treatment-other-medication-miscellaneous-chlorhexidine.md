<p>Chlorhexidine is an effective and widely used skin and mucosa
    (lining of the mouth) antiseptic, with antibacterial and
    antifungal properties. It is included on the World Health
    Organisation list of the safest and most effective medicines.
    It is less of an irritant to the tissue than iodine and is
    an alternative for skin disinfection when allergy to iodine
    is a problem.</p>
<p>Chlorhexidine is widely used for skin disinfection before surgery
    (including ‘scrubbing up’ of the surgeon) and for the
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/detailed">cleaning of wounds</a> . There is some evidence suggesting
        that chlorhexidine is a slightly more effective skin
        disinfectant than various iodine preparations used for
        the same purpose.</p>
<p>Chlorhexidine is otherwise probably best known in its role as
    a mouthwash component (as the active component in several
    well-known, over the counter, branded products). As ingredient
    in a mouthwash it is used to prevent or treat <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">fungal and bacterial infections</a>    after oral surgery, as well as in everyday <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    routines. Its antiseptic properties are particularly useful
    when regular oral hygiene routines, using a toothbrush or
    other mechanical tools, are difficult or impossible. Owing
    to its particular chemical properties (Figure 1), chlorhexidine
    is thought to be slightly more effective than other mouthwashes
    in preventing and treating oral infections.</p>

</figure>
<p>Chlorhexidine belongs to a class of chemicals (bisbiguanides)
    with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial properties</a>.
    It is mostly used in the form of a solution of one of its
    salts, and in this cationic (positively charged) form sticks
    to skin, mucosa and the enamel of teeth for extended periods
    of time (assumed to be the reason for its enhanced effectiveness).
    The same trait of chemical properties also explains why chlorhexidine
    mouthwashes should not be used immediately after brushing
    teeth: chlorhexidine reacts with the anionic (negatively
    charged) components and detergents in toothpastes, forming
    an insoluble material that has little protective effects.
    Optimal use of chlorhexidine mouthwash should include a delay
    of at least 30 minutes between the use of toothpaste and
    the chlorhexidine mouthwash.</p>
<p>The antibacterial and antifungal properties of chlorhexidine
    originate from exactly this ability of adhesion to surfaces:
    chlorhexidine interferes with the cell wall surfaces of bacteria
    and fungi (as many <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial and antifungal agents</a>    do). This interference stops the growth (bacteriostatic)
    of infectious microorganisms at relatively low dosage, chlorhexidine
    at higher dosage acts as a bactericidal agent and kills bacteria
    (and fungi) by complete disruption of their cell walls.</p>
<p>Chlorhexidine is active against a range of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria</a>    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultative_anaerobes">facultative anaerobes</a>    as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobes">aerobes</a>)
    and a range of fungi, with a range of antimicrobial activity
    depending on the species.</p>
<p>Unwanted effects of the extended use of chlorhexidine in its
    use as a mouthwash ingredient include damage to the mucosa,
    staining of teeth and soft tissues, and occasionally a distorted
    <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">sense of taste</a>. A range
    of different preparations of chlorhexidine mouthwashes is
    available, with a view to reducing adverse effects of, and
    improving compliance with, its use. Many chlorhexidine mouthwash
    preparations include alcohol (ethanol or isopropanol) which
    may exacerbate dry mouth problems (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>)
    – alcohol-free preparations are preferable in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Staining of teeth and soft tissues can be a disincentive to use
    chlorhexidine mouthwashes (although it is a reversible effect
    that is easily dealt with by a professional dental hygienist).
    The degree of staining depends on duration of use, overall
    dosage and diet. Just as chlorhexidine interacts with some
    ingredients in toothpaste, or with the cell walls of bacteria,
    it also interacts with proteins in food, especially tannins
    (prominently present in tea, coffee and red wine). Alternative
    non-staining (or: less-staining) formulations are available.
    Studies suggest that non-staining chlorhexidine mouthwash
    preparations are equally effective as antiseptics and in
    preventing the build-up of bacterial plaque as the original
    formulations.</p>
<p>There have been case reports of allergic reactions to chlorhexidine,
    although these have mostly been in relation to indwelling
    catheters coated with the antiseptic.</p>
