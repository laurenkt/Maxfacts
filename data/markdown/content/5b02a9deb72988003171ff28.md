<p>Where surgical intervention is thought to be the best way forward
    to deal with issues due to disproportionate growth of the
    jaws, this is purely elective surgery. Extremely careful
    assessment and diagnosis, underpinning an informed decision
    based on fully explored potential risks and benefits, plays
    a major role in these circumstances. Accordingly, below we
    outline the various general and specific assessments in the
    process in a little more detail.</p>
<p>Before we start, a brief comment on potentially confusing nomenclature
    about malocclusions may be useful. There are several terms,
    definitions and classifications (after E. Angle, the ‘father
    of modern orthodontics’; early 20<sup>th</sup> century) in
    use, all meaning essentially the same condition(s).</p>
<p><strong>Angle class I</strong> (neutrocclusion): Normal occlusion
    of molar teeth but there may be some other issues with
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">ectopic teeth</a> (misaligned or wrongly erupted teeth),
        spacing or overcrowding issues. These conditions are
        largely the domain of orthodontics (see below) and will
        typically not require orthognathic surgery (although
        some other maxillofacial surgical interventions may be
        necessary, such as the <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth">removal of unerupted or impacted teeth</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Angle class II malocclusion</strong> (distocclusion,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrognathism">retrognathism</a>):
    mandibular hypoplasia, a relatively too small lower jaw,
    causes this. This class of malocclusion has two further subdivisions,
    determined by the degree of overlap of the top teeth to the
    bottom teeth (overbite).</p>
<p><strong>Angle class III malocclusion</strong> (mesiocclusion,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognathism">prognathism</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_crossbite">anterior crossbite</a>, negative
    overjet, underbite): maxillary hypoplasia, a relatively too
    small upper jaw, or mandibular hyperplasia, a relatively
    too big lower jaw, can be the cause.</p>
<p>Significant class II and class III malocclusions may benefit
    from orthognathic surgery. There can be different classes
    of malocclusion on the left and right sides.</p>
<h1 id="history"><a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">History</a></h1>
<p>A prime reason for taking a detailed history is to identify somebody’s
    perception of the problem. It is also used to assess somebody’s
    <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/fitness">fitness</a> for surgery.
    This is entirely elective surgery it is therefore even more
    essential that any risks associated with the surgery are
    kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>Occasionally a cause, such as a family trait, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies">congenital deformity</a>,
    or trauma in infancy is identified, although usually there
    is no obvious aetiological factor. People present with various
    complaints. Most are concerned about their appearance; they
    may also be concerned about their ability to chew, bite or
    speak.</p>
<p>Occasionally people are referred for orthognathic surgery in
    the belief that their <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">temporomandibular (jaw) joint (TMJ) dysfunction</a>    may be helped by surgery. There is little evidence that the
    correction of malocclusion can improve TMJ pain or dysfunction.
    It is inadvisable to promote orthognathic treatment as a
    treatment for TMJ conditions. People should be aware that
    pre-existing TMJ symptoms may worsen, persist or improve
    during and/or after orthognathic treatment, it is entirely
    unpredictable.</p>
<p>During the assessment all involved, clinicians and patients,
    must always be mindful of unrealistic expectations. Some
    people may have excessive concern for minor or imperceptible
    abnormalities and may produce diagrams or photographs showing
    how they would like to appear. Some people feel that an operation
    would improve their relationships or job prospects, providing
    an instant solution to their problems. To avoid serious problems,
    disagreements and disappointment later on, a frank and serious
    conversation at this stage is a reasonable and necessary
    way forward. It is, however, true that in carefully selected
    cases, paired with realistic expectations, surgical correction
    of jaw disproportion can bring about great satisfaction and
    improved social confidence.</p>
<h1 id="clinical-examination"><a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">Clinical Examination</a></h1>
<p>The clinical examination should consist of a systematic evaluation
    approach to both the soft and hard tissues.</p>
<h4><strong>Profile</strong></h4>
<p>The patient should be sitting comfortably with the Frankfurt
    plane horizontal (the Frankfurt plane is also called the
    eye-ear plane, it is a descriptor in craniometry (measurements
    of the skull). This line, when adjusted as horizontal, corresponds
    to a posture where somebody is sitting upright such that
    a line taken from roughly the middle of the ear to the peak
    position of the cheekbone is horizontal; see Figure 1).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The Frankfurt plane; in addition
        two characteristic points used in craniometry, A and
        B, are also indicated.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is useful here to consider the concept of the face being divided
    into thirds; an upper, a middle, and a lower third. The lower
    third itself is divided into thirds; the upper lip being
    one third compared to the lower two thirds, which extend
    from the lower lip margin (stomion) to the chin margin (menton).
    Facial aesthetics is maintained when the lower face height
    is about 50 to 55 % of the total face height, when measuring
    from nasion (the depressed area on the nose, just above the
    bridge of the nose and below the glabella (the area between
    the eyebrows) to menton.</p>
<p>The relation of the maxilla to the mandible is noted (skeletal
    classification). In the maxilla, prognathism or retrognathism
    can be diagnosed, as the face will appear more convex or
    concave, respectively. In addition, the shape and size of
    the nose are examined.</p>
<p>The nasolabial angle (the angle between the surface of the upper
    lip, in the middle of the lip, and the inferion (bottom border
    of the nose) is normally about 90°. Retraction of the upper
    incisors (front teeth) may open this angle and lead to poorer
    aesthetics by potentially causing dishing of the lower face
    and making the nose appear more prominent.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Class III malocclusion, showing
        an acute nasolabial angle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The important horizontal relationship of the maxilla to the mandible
    is assessed. The most common problems are mandibular prognathism
    and retrognathism. By examining the maxilla first, apparent
    mandibular prognathism caused by a hypoplastic maxilla can
    be ruled out (see Figure 3). Some clinicians place cotton
    wool under the upper lip to mimic maxillary advancement.
    Similarly, the surgical correction of a retrognathic mandible
    can be visualized by posturing the mandible forward by the
    desired amount.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Full-face view showing paranasal
        hollowing, indicating maxillary hypoplasia.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some points to consider at the planning stage include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>advancement of the maxilla increases upper incisor show;</li>
    <li>the alar base cinch suture (suture at the base of the nose)
        <ul>
            <li>controls the transverse dimension of the alar base</li>
            <li>improves tip projection</li>
            <li>maintains the thickness of the upper lip</li>
            <li>decreases shortening of the upper lip;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>nasal tip moves relative to A point (see Figure 1) in a ratio
        of approximately
        <ul>
            <li>1: 3 for <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">Le Fort I osteotomies</a></li>
            <li>1: 2 for <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">Le Fort II osteotomies</a></li>
            <li>1 :1 for <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">Le Fort III osteotomies</a>;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>chin, soft tissue-pogonion moves approximately 1 : 1 with
        either mandibular advance or setback;</li>
    <li>lower lip moves approximately
        <ul>
            <li>85 % of the skeletal move in advancement</li>
            <li>60 % of the skeletal move in setback.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

    dimensions.</p>

<h3><strong>Full Face</strong></h3>
<p>Any asymmetry of the face is examined, including the level of
    the eyes. This is the time to compare facial and dental midlines,
    which can then be transferred to the study casts (see below).
    Any cant in the occlusal plane can be confirmed by placing
    a wooden spatula transversely between the teeth. Lip seal
    and incisor show both at rest and smiling should be measured.
    Over- or underbite can be measured directly, see Figure 4.
    This allows assessment of any excessive incisor or gingival
    (gum) show, an important baseline in surgical planning.</p>

        approximately 12 mm.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4><strong>Intraoral Examination</strong></h4>
<p>The molar and incisal relationships are examined visually and
    are formally documented by photographs (see Figure 5, Figure
    6 and Figure 7 for examples) and study models (see below).</p>

<p>A thorough dental examination should take place, especially noting
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a> and <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">carious teeth</a>.
    Routine dental care must be completed first, by the general
    dental practitioner.</p>
<h1 id="radiographic-examination"><a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">Radiographic examination</a></h1>
<p>A series of standardized radiographs are studied as part of the
    assessment.</p>
<p>A panoramic radiograph, <strong>OPG</strong>, (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">orthopantogram</a>;
    also referred to as a dental panoramic tomogram (<strong>DPT</strong>)
    reveals <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">caries</a> and
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth">unerupted or impacted teeth</a>,
    and the presence of coincidental pathology, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>    (see Figure 8 for an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">Panoramic radiograph</a>        of a patient showing wisdom teeth destined for removal
        in an otherwise ‘dentally fit’ person.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A <strong>lateral cephalogram</strong> (a profile side-view X-ray
    image of the skull and soft tissues) is required. This view
    supplements clinical analysis with cephalometric analysis
    (a range of measurements of the head and skull). See Figure
    9 for an example of a lateral cephalogram.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> A lateral cephalogram of a patient
        with a class III malocclusion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Intraoral radiographs</strong> are taken as needed, there
    are various such views (on <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">intraoral films</a>).
    The <strong>upper anterior occlusal radiograph</strong> is
    the most commonly used. This view uses an imaginary plane
    to focus on the maxilla and upper front teeth. It is essential
    for the assessment of unerupted canine teeth. Figure 10 shows
    an example of an upper anterior occlusal radiograph.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Upper anterior occlusal image,
        allowing localisation of ectopic canine teeth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Cephalometric analysis</strong> is, in essence, the interpretation
    of measurements of the skull and facial bones using agreed
    angulations and linear distances to aid in determining the
    underlying aetiology of a particular problem. Many analyses
    exist with varying degrees of complexity. Some have a specific
    set of indications for use. However, most clinicians will
    favour a few analyses with which they will be familiar.</p>
<p>It must also be remembered that any such analysis is based on
    modelling assumptions and/ or small sets of model data. Thus,
    it is important to remember that a patient is being treated
    and not a radiograph. Whichever analysis is used, it is only
    a guide, even if the software used produces impressive-looking
    pictures.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Data-analysis based assessments, all kinds of data visualisation
        methods and 3D image reconstruction methods are areas
        where progress is rapid. If you’d like to read more about
        recent developments, this is covered (and regularly updated)
        in our section about <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments">new developments</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="photographs">Photographs</h1>
<p>These usually consist of a standardized set of images. Extraoral
    photographs include the full face at rest and smiling, three-quarter
    left and right side views of the face, and a profile. Intraoral
    photographic views should show anterior (front) and buccal
    (side) teeth in occlusion.</p>
<p>Some clinicians like to construct a montage using the lateral
    cephalogram (see above) and profile photograph in a 1 : 1
    ratio. This tries to mimic postsurgical soft tissue movement.
    This technique, like computer generated programmes which
    purport to simulate the variable impact of surgical movement
    of the jaws, has limitations and must be used with caution
    in order to avoid unrealistic expectations.</p>
<h1 id="study-models">Study Models</h1>
<p>Records are taken at various stages of treatment, usually before
    and after orthodontic treatment (see below), before and after
    surgical treatment, and at review appointments at yearly
    intervals for up to five years after treatment. These records
    are combined with a record of the occlusion in the form of
    a wax squash bite (see Figure 11).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Trimmed study model.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The models are trimmed in a standardized manner. On the models,
    markings can be made (for example, the facial midline in
    relation to the dental midline). Models can be taken at various
    stages of treatment, and are used for differing reasons (for
    example, clinical records, orthodontic planning, and model
    surgery).</p>
<p>Prior to the orthognathic surgery, a facebow recording is made
    (see Figure 12). A facebow is a device to essentially translate
    geometric measurements on the face / head to a mechanical
    device, an articulator (see below).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> A facebow for recording the relative
        positions of the jaws and fixed cranial and facial reference
        points.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The most recent study models are mounted on a semi-adjustable
    or fully adjustable anatomical articulator (see Figure 13).
    An articulator is a mechanical device where all parts can
    be moved in a reproducible manner in all three dimensions.
    These models are duplicated for the fabrication of occlusal
    wafers, which are essential for the perioperative localisation
    of the maxilla in <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">bimaxillary procedures</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Two examples of semi-adjustable
        articulators for clinical (top) and laboratory (bottom)
        use.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Model surgery is performed to gauge whether a satisfactory occlusion
    is attainable. Model surgery also gives a measure of the
    required surgical movements (see Figure 14).  </p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure14.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 14:</strong> Model surgery, view before (left)
        and after (right) intervention.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="orthodontic-treatment">Orthodontic treatment</h1>
<p>The presurgical orthodontic phase is designed to place the teeth
    in their correct final position over the dental bases prior
    to surgery. This involves the correction of dental alignment
    (see Figure 15), arch levelling, decompensation of teeth
    in all three planes of space and arch coordination.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure15.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 15:</strong> Dental crowding that requires
        preoperative orthodontic correction.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is essential that both the patient and the orthodontic and
    surgical team are clear about this phase because orthodontic
    decompensation <i>prior</i> to surgery will make the occlusal
    relationships significantly worse. The presurgical orthodontic
    phase can last between 12 and 18 months (Figure 16).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure16.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 16:</strong> Intraoral view of a patient with
        a class II malocclusion who is undergoing orthodontic
        treatment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It would be utterly inappropriate for a patient to then decide
    they did not want surgery as all the preceding treatment
    would have been moving the teeth in the opposite way from
    that used by orthodontic camouflage (orthodontic corrective
    treatment only) (Figure 17).</p>

<p>Postsurgical orthodontic treatment involves final detailing of
    the occlusion and should be kept to as short a period of
    time as possible.</p>
