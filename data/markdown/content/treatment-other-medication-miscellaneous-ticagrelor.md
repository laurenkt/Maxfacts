<p>Ticagrelor is one of several widely prescribed <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiplatelet">antiplatelet medications</a>,
    used to prevent thrombosis (blood clots) in arteries and
    arterioles. A common reason for long-term treatment with
    ticagrelor is risk reduction for stroke and cardiovascular
    diseases. Â </p>

<p>As depicted in Figure 1, ticagrelor belongs to a slightly different
    class of chemicals, compared with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/clopidogrel">clopidogrel</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prasugrel">prasugrel</a>.
    Its effect is blockage of the receptor protein P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>    that is found on the surface of platelets, similarly to the
    P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> protein blockage by clopidogrel
    and prasugrel. Blocking P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> prevents
    the aggregation of platelets and thus the formation of a
    blood clot. The resulting, most prominent adverse effect
    of ticagrelor (and other antiplatelet medications) is a tendency
    for excessive <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">bleeding</a>.</p>
<p>In this regard ticagrelor has very similar properties to those
    of clopidogrel and prasugrel. However, owing to its different
    chemical composition and structure, ticagrelor binds to a
    different region of the P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> platelet
    surface protein. Clinically, the main difference between
    ticagrelor and clopidogrel/prasugrel probably is that the
    ticagrelor mode of binding to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>    is reversible. Hence, if necessary its effect is more easily
    reverted. This is relevant for a range of oral and maxillofacial
    surgical interventions, especially for trauma and other emergency
    situations leading to blood loss.</p>
