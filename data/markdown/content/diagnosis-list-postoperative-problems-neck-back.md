<p>Postoperative problems affecting the back of the neck include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars, some incisions will extend to the back of the neck.
        These can be troublesome as it is difficult to see the
        wounds to manage them.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">Altered sensation</a>.
        If the nerves supplying skin sensation have been manipulated,
        altered sensation for a variable length of time can occur.</li>
    <li>Stiffness. A lack of mobility can happen when the motor nerve
        to the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">muscles of the neck</a>        (trapezius and sternomastoid) is either removed or manipulated
        as part of a <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">neck dissection</a>.
        This stiffness can make driving problematic as it is
        difficult to look in mirrors.</li>
    <li>Minor arthritic changes may be made worse if the neck has
        to be hyperextended to facilitate operation or <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">intubation</a>.</li>
</ul>
