<p>There are four paired cavities (sinuses), essentially extensions
    to the nose. Of these paranasal sinuses the maxillary sinus
    (also known as the antrum) is of greatest significance in
    the context of oral and maxillofacial surgery. This cavity
    is located right above the upper jaw, with only a thin layer
    of bony separation and in direct contact with the teeth in
    the upper jaw. This is of general relevance with regard to
    diagnosis of conditions that may arise in the mouth and appear
    to manifest in the maxillary sinus â€“ or the other way around.</p>
<p>An oroantral fistula (a communication between the oral cavity
    and the maxillary sinus (antrum) is a common condition. Lining
    of the antrum may prolapse through such a fistula (Figure
    1), or the fistula will have become lined with epithelium
    (thin, surface-covering tissue) as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>A fistula differs from a sinus in being an epithelial lined connection
    between a cavity to another cavity or the outside or inside
    body surface. A sinus may be epithelium lined but originates
    from an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>, retained
    tooth root or area of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">necrotic bone</a>.
    A fistula connecting the mouth and maxillary antrum starts
    as a communication before it becomes lined with epithelium.
    This is important to understand when it comes to <a href="/treatment/surgery/fistula/more-info">treatment of the fistula</a>.</p>

<p>The most common cause of an oroantral fistula is the extraction
    of a single standing molar tooth with multiple roots, especially
    with hypercementosis (excessive formation of mineralised
    tissue around the root of a tooth) present. If such a tooth
    root is in close proximity to the antrum, chances are high
    that extraction of the tooth may lead to the formation of
    an oroantral fistula.</p>
<p>An established (chronic) oroantral fistula (Figure 3) leads to
    bouts of recurrent maxillary sinusitis, there may be a foul
    taste in the mouth, and fluids may be passing from the mouth
    through the fistula and out of the nose. The fistula can
    be demonstrated by occluding the nose and blowing out through
    the nose: air will be seen to bubble out of the fistula.
    A plain <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiograph</a>    helps to identify any fragments of retained roots in the
    sinus.</p>
