<p>The mouth, jaws and face, head and neck, may only account for
    a fairly small proportion of a body’s volume. However, this
    part of the body is incredibly dense in terms of multiple
    critical bodily functions. Accordingly, the list of diagnoses
    of oral and maxillofacial conditions is long and varied.</p>
<p>All diagnoses are described and discussed at different levels
    of detail: we give a brief overview, a slightly more in-depth
    description and a detailed discussion accepting that different
    levels and degrees of information will be wanted by different
    people and by the same people at different times.</p>
