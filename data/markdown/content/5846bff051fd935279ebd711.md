<p>Alcoholic beverages, produced by fermentation of carbohydrates,
    have been consumed for thousands of years in one form or
    another. Indeed, the development of agriculture as the foundation
    of civilisation is thought to owe itself to the cultivation
    of grains for beer brewing. Over time and locations, attitudes
    vary from prohibition in twenties America, to binge drinking
    in modern times in the UK, to continued bans of alcohol for
    religious reasons. Alcohol is probably the most widely used
    and abused drug on this planet.</p>
<h1 id="alcohol-consumption-and-its-journey-through-the-body">Alcohol - consumption and its journey through the body</h1>
<p>Alcohol, that is ethanol (or ethyl alcohol), EtOH, is a very
    small molecule (see Figure 1) that is readily soluble in
    water. EtOH and water are completely miscible and EtOH can
    easily transgress biological membranes, including the blood-brain
    barrier. The energy content of ethanol is considerable, 7.1
    kcal/g (which can add to ‘invisible’ caloric intake).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The molecular structure of EtOH.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>EtOH is mainly absorbed from the intestines. The effects experienced
    of EtOH on the body primarily depend on the amount ingested.
    In addition, the EtOH absorption rate by drinking also depends
    on the EtOH concentration of the beverage, on the CO<sub>2</sub>    content of the beverage (EtOH from fizzy drinks is more readily
    absorbed), on the speed of drinking, on any foods eaten around
    the time of drinking (composition, amount and timing), gender
    (because there are different fat/water ratios in male and
    female bodies), individual EtOH drinking habits and history.
    Absorption rates are individually extremely variable. There
    are <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/further-reading">studies</a>    eluding to possible health benefits from moderate alcohol
    intake (such as a glass of red wine with a meal in a Mediterranean-style
    diet).</p>
<p>Table 1 summarizes some general trends of EtOH effects as a function
    of blood alcohol content (BAC).</p>

<p>More than 90 percent of EtOH is metabolised in the liver (accordingly,
    continued excessive alcohol consumption primarily damages
    the liver) in a stepwise mechanism involving a range of enzymes
    as summarized in Figure 2.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The metabolic pathway of EtOH.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First, EtOH is oxidised to acetaldehyde (a chemically reactive
    and toxic substance) with the help of the enzyme ADH (alcohol
    dehydrogenase). This is followed in the next step by further
    oxidation to acetic acid / acetate, enabled by the enzyme
    ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase). In the final step further
    oxidation yields water, H<sub>2</sub>O and carbon dioxide,
    CO<sub>2</sub> which are excreted <i>via</i> urine, sweat
    and breath.</p>
<p>The enzyme ADH is easily saturated, even at low EtOH blood content,
    so ADH determines the overall metabolic rate in a healthy
    person (the ALDH promoted oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic
    acid / acetate is not rate-limiting). Any accumulation of
    aldehyde from excessive EtOH intake is associated with headache,
    nausea, gastritis and unpleasant hangover effects. In addition,
    acetaldehyde molecules tend to form stable conglomerates
    with some nucleic acid molecules (lysine, in particular)
    and these complexes trigger inflammatory reactions of the
    liver tissue.</p>
<p>Having to process and to metabolise large quantities of EtOH
    does lasting harm to the liver by negatively interfering
    with many of the liver’s metabolic pathways, in particular
    with its many roles in oxidation and reduction reactions.
    For example, the central role of liver metabolism in the
    energy production for the body is impaired: the synthesis
    of glucose (the body’s ‘energy pack’ sugar molecule) is hindered
    because pyruvate is prevented from playing its usual role
    in the production of glucose and instead is used up in the
    production of excess lactate, with the further consequence
    that ureate is no longer properly excreted via the kidneys,
    uric acid accumulates, leading to gout and a condition called
    lactic acidosis (build-up of lactate in the body, making
    one ill). Impaired glucose synthesis can lead to dangerous
    hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) from heavy drinking.
    The EtOH metabolism also interferes with the normal balanced
    processing and production of fatty acids by promoting the
    synthesis of excess fatty acid, leading to a condition called
    ketoacidosis (build-up of ketones in the body from lowered
    pH value (higher acidity)). The oxidation rate of lipids
    is reduced, leading to an accumulation of fat in liver cells,
    especially triglycerides. Over time, a fatty liver deteriorates
    <i>via</i> a hepatitis stage to a liver damaged by fibrosis
    (scarring of connective tissue) and finally cirrhosis (severe
    and irreversible scarring of the liver tissue) and fatal
    liver failure. Disruption of liver function by EtOH metabolism
    further causes electrolyte imbalances in the body (especially
    Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and deficiencies in
    vitamins, particularly folate, thiamine and vitamin B6.</p>
<p>Elimination rates of EtOH from the body are individually highly
    variable, with the highest elimination rates occurring for
    alcoholics during detox:</p>
<p>Alcoholics during detox &gt; healthy binge drinkers immediately
    after a heavy drinking session or long-term drinkers during
    treatment with a high-protein diet &gt; heavy long-term drinkers
    (no liver damage yet) &gt; healthy moderate drinkers &gt;&gt;
    people with liver dysfunction (cirrhosis), poor diet, malnourishment,
    or taking some drugs that block ADH (for example cimetidine,
    an over-the-counter inhibitor of stomach acid production,
    which is often taken in parallel with EtOH).</p>
<h1 id="alcohol--how-and-why-it-is-an-addictive-drug">Alcohol – how and why it is an addictive drug</h1>
<p>Nobody needs any lecturing about the potentially devastating
    effects of EtOH addiction on individuals, their families
    and friends, and society overall. And nobody needs reminding
    of the addictive properties of EtOH. But it may be helpful
    to consider in a little more detail how the EtOH molecule
    acts in the brain, in multiple direct and indirect ways:
    this will illustrate rather well why the story of EtOH abuse
    is a rather complicated one!</p>
<p>To start with, there is not even a clear cut and simple definition
    of the meaning of the term ‘alcoholism’ – or better: ‘alcohol
    dependence’ (and since 2013 as the preferred term ‘alcohol
    use disorder’).</p>
<p>Several criteria have been collated:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Developing tolerance (see below)</li>
    <li>Withdrawal symptoms (see below)</li>
    <li>Using larger amounts than intended</li>
    <li>Inability to reduce consumption</li>
    <li>Disproportionate amounts of time dedicated to sourcing alcohol
        and/or suffering from hang-over</li>
    <li>Increasing social isolation due to alcohol consumption</li>
    <li>Continued excessive use despite knowledge about harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>There seems to be agreement that if at least three of these criteria
    are fulfilled over a period of at least twelve months, this
    is an indication of alcohol dependence. This approach certainly
    is an indication that the story of EtOH as an addictive recreational
    drug is indeed complicated, with a high degree of individual
    variability.</p>
<p>When thinking about the addictive power of <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">nicotine</a>,
    the underlying mechanisms there seem comparatively straightforward:
    by and large, the nicotine molecule transgresses the blood-brain
    barrier, it finds its preferred receptor site to interact
    with – one that happens to lead to increased release of dopamine
    (the substance in our brains that is related to pleasurable
    ‘reward’ experiences and that is in some ways involved in
    the working of nearly all addictive substances), which explains
    the addictive power of nicotine.</p>
<p>The small EtOH molecules are also easily able to transgress the
    blood-brain barrier, and if it wasn’t for the actions of
    EtOH in the brain, it would not be an addictive drug. Other
    than with nicotine, there is not one single, or even one
    main, mechanism how EtOH impacts on brain function. The small
    EtOH molecules diffuse to several sites in the lipid bilayer
    of neurons (the communication nodes in the brain) and interfere
    there with several different neurotransmitter functions and
    receptors in direct and/or indirect ways (neurotransmitters
    are messenger molecules, responsible for communication and
    chains of command amongst the network of neurons in the brain).
    Figure 3 attempts to give an (simplified) overview of some
    of the main EtOH interaction mechanisms in the brain.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Some of the main interaction sites
        of the EtOH molecule with receptors and neurotransmitters.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main interaction sites of EtOH are receptors for neurotransmitters
    with different properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/gaba">GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)</a>        is the main neurotransmitter with inhibitory effects
        (sedative and anxiolytic); EtOH interfers with the corresponding
        receptor sites and leads to its downregulation (that
        is, less activity and less release of GABA).</li>
    <li>Glutamate is the main excitatory (stimulant) neurotransmitter;
        EtOH interferes with the corresponding receptor sites
        (NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors) and inhibits
        the stimulant effects.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/dopamine">Dopamine</a>        is the substance responsible for pleasurable reward sensations;
        EtOH increases the release of dopamine.</li>
    <li>Opioids are not all synthetic laboratory-made substances,
        the body / brain has its own opioid synthesis pathways
        for two types of substances (endorphins and enkephalins)
        with effects similar to those of synthetic opioids (relief
        of pain and anxiety); EtOH leads to increased release
        of these endogenous (made by the body) opioids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a massive impact on neuronal pathways with such different
    properties explains why different concentrations of EtOH
    have seemingly contradictory effects as stimulating or as
    sedative drug: at low concentrations simply the inhibition
    of inhibitory pathways is the main effect (hence the overall
    slightly stimulant effect at low EtOH concentrations), whereas
    with increasing EtOH concentrations the resulting effect
    is increasingly a sedative effect.</p>
<p>EtOH has profound and multiple effects on the overall brain function,
    and there is no known antagonist for EtOH (that is, there
    is no known substance that counteracts all the effects of
    EtOH). These complicated and multiple different direct and
    indirect interactions of EtOH with the entire neurotransmitter
    network also make it plausible why EtOH <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">interferes with numerous medicinal drugs</a>,
    where, for example, it potentiates the effects of other sedatives
    (such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines), why complicated
    and individually different patterns of abuse and dependence
    develop, and how excessive alcohol consumption over long
    periods of time not only damages the liver.</p>
<p>An important part of the dependence-forming properties of EtOH
    is not just related to the involvement of enhanced dopamine
    release, but the rapid development of tolerance. Becoming
    tolerant to a drug means that more of it is needed to achieve
    the same effect as previously with a lower dose. This happens
    because after repeated exposure neuroadaptation occurs, increasing
    the number of relevant receptor sites (alcohol inhibits the
    NMDA / glutamate receptor, so this receptor gets upregulated;
    the GABA receptors become less sensitive to the effects of
    EtOH and the enhanced dopamine release becomes less, as well
    as the opioid receptor responses becoming less) as well as
    leading to overall changes in absorption, metabolism and
    excretion. With EtOH, both acute and chronic forms of tolerance
    develop. Tolerance leads to increased consumption, it maintains
    and supports dependence and increases the risk of harm. In
    parallel cross-tolerance to other sedatives develops, carrying
    increased risks of overdosing some substances. With EtOH
    also some behavioural tolerance evolves over continued excessive
    EtOH consumption: to some extent, the body learns how to
    cope while being intoxicated. In addition, there are several
    reinforcement mechanisms in place, all pushing toward continued
    consumption. Some of these are positive reinforcement mechanisms,
    such as gain of pleasure or being in tune with peer behaviour;
    other reinforcement mechanisms are the (urgent and strong)
    desire to avoid withdrawal symptoms, or to relief stress
    in general.</p>
<p>Suddenly stopping prolonged excessive drinking habits leads to
    EtOH withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms may start soon after
    the last drink, within hours, and may persist for several
    weeks. The withdrawal symptoms include irritability, increased
    heart rate, headache, sweating, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations,
    severe anxiety and tremors. Serious EtOH withdrawal symptoms
    (delirium tremens) are a medical emergency (with a mortality
    of ca. 5 percent).</p>
<p>From the above description of the multiple interactions of EtOH
    with multiple neurotransmitter systems, it is straightforward
    to see that a sudden return to no-EtOH exposure leads to
    some hard-to-control hyperactivity of numerous neurotransmitter
    pathways in the brain. The multiple mechanisms in which EtOH
    interfers with normal brain function also provide opportunities
    for medication to support medically controlled and supervised
    detoxification. The most widely used drug to support detoxification
    is a benzodiazepine derivative, chlordiazepoxide; it reduces
    some of the withdrawal symptoms (convulsions and hallucinations)
    and cravings. A different mechanism is exploited by disulfiram:
    it blocks the ALDH receptor (see Figure 2, above) which leads
    to acetaldehyde accumulation and related unpleasant vomiting,
    making drinking EtOH altogether a very unpleasant experience.
    This is why metronidazole (an anaerobicidal <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotic drug</a>    with a similar molecular structure) must not be mixed with
    alcohol in any form. A third mechanism to support EtOH detoxification
    is the use of a drug that efficiently blocks the rewarding,
    dopamine-related effects from consuming EtOH (naltrexone).</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps some extra-motivation to quit excessive alcohol use</strong>    when confronted with oral and maxillofacial surgery: there
    are multiple enhanced risks during and around the time of
    surgery, leading to higher morbidity and increased risk of
    post-operative complications as well as higher risks from
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthetics</a>    during surgery. Many of these risks are related to acute
    alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Several drugs commonly used
    post-surgery (antibiotic and antifungal medications) interfere
    negatively with continued alcohol consumption. Excessive
    prolonged alcohol consumption is directly toxic to the oral
    mucosa; this toxicity is likely to be due to exposure to
    EtOH as well as to its metabolite acetaldehyde (see Figure
    2). This mechanism is thought to underpin the role of EtOH
    in oral tumour promotion because of increased cell regeneration,
    as well as obviously inhibiting healing of the oral mucosa.</p>
<p>Unless you are faced with emergency surgery, there is usually
    enough time before elective (planned) surgery to engage in
    a supported round of pre-surgical detoxification. With the
    right kind of motivation and support in place, this can be
    done at home which is more pleasant for you and at least
    as effective as a much more expensive admission to hospital
    for essentially the same process.</p>
