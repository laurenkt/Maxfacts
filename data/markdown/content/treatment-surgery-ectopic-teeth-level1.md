<p>Removal of misplaced teeth is easily the commonest oral surgical
    operation – it may be the most common operation in all of
    surgery.</p>
<p>Teeth are extremely hard but sensate and vascularised structures.
    There are 32 in the adult human being, they may erupt in
    sequence and fulfil their role in life, or they may not.
    If they do not – most commonly with third molar teeth (wisdom
    teeth) then they may become jammed in some part of the jaw.
    These are ectopic teeth. Any tooth may become ectopic but
    wisdom teeth and canine teeth are the most common.</p>
<p>Philosophies differ as to whether or not a tooth in the wrong
    place should be removed or repositioned or not. This is influenced
    worldwide by the various healthcare-funding systems.</p>
<p>If a tooth is important to aesthetics and function (the canine
    tooth, particularly the upper canine tooth is such), then
    detecting its position and whether or not it is likely to
    move into its proper position naturally at the age of 12,
    is clearly important. If it is in the wrong place then a
    constructive combination of surgery and orthodontics (straightening
    of teeth) can correct this small natural aberration.</p>
<p>If a tooth is deeply buried in jaw bone and is causing no symptoms,
    then there is no evidence to support invasive and potentially
    harmful surgery to remove it. Quite wild suggestions about
    the long-term risks of leaving deeply impacted wisdom teeth
    alone (such as the infinitesimally small risk of developing
    tumours within an associated <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cystic cavity</a>)
    are completely counterintuitive and entirely without supporting
    evidence.</p>
<p>It is, however, true that partially erupted wisdom teeth which
    are not causing symptoms currently, may become <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infected</a>    and require removal at a later age when the operation is
    more traumatic.</p>
<p>In this respect, substantial differences have emerged amongst
    different health providers and clinicians with recommendations
    and guidelines which are at times taken as absolute rules.
    They are not, they are recommendations which can be deviated
    from after a sensible discussion and agreement between surgeon
    and patient.</p>
<p>On our <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth/detailed">detailed page about the treatment of ectopic teeth</a>,
    we outline in some detail what these interventions involve.
    This should help guide the individual making what can be
    a difficult decision about a surgical intervention, which
    has both postoperative symptoms and potential <a href="/treatment/surgery/postoperative-problems/teeth">postoperative problems</a>.</p>
