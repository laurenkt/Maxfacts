<p>Tranexamic acid is a small organic molecule, chemically closely
    related to the essential (not made by the body in mammals)
    amino acid lysine (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>Tranexamic acid is a long established medicinal drug that is
    used to stop excessive bleeding. Accordingly, it has an important
    role in emergency surgery after major trauma (or childbirth,
    or any other events that may lead to excessive blood loss
    unless the bleeding can be stopped rapidly; this application
    includes some elective (non-emergency) surgery). It is used
    topically (as a mouthwash) in patients bleeding following
    oral surgery who have either a bleeding tendency or have
    received <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiplatelet">anti-platelet drugs</a>    (a type of drugs which hamper the first step in the formation
    of a blood clot, the clumping of blood platelets; examples
    of antiplatelet drugs are <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/aspirin">aspirin</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/clopidogrel">clopidogrel</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prasugrel">prasugrel</a>    or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/ticagrelor">ticagrelor</a>).</p>
<p>Tranexamic acid very efficiently stops bleeding by blocking the
    enzyme plasmin from acting as a fibrin-dissolving agent.
    Fibrin is an insoluble protein that is involved in blood
    clotting and in biochemical repair of damaged small blood
    vessels.</p>
