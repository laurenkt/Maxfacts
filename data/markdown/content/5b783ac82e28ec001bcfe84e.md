<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the lower jaw
    (mandible) include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bleeding, immediate. Direct <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy</a>        to seal blood vessel(s), applying pressure using packs,
        bone wax, fibrin glue, resorbable collagen, or other
        proprietary products.</li>
    <li>Pain. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Analgesia</a>,
        local and systemic. <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">Immobilization and fixation</a>        will address pain from bone mobility.</li>
    <li>Malocclusion. Revision of the fracture repair by taking off
        all fixation and <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">reducing the fracture</a>        in the correct position and re-fixing it.</li>
    <li>Swelling. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">Corticosteroids and systemic anti-inflammatories</a>.
        Cooling by applying cold compression therapy (hilotherapy)
        or special cooling masks may help.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>.
        Immediate <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">surgical repair</a>        if the nerve is divided, removal of anything causing
        pressure on the nerve.</li>
</ul>
