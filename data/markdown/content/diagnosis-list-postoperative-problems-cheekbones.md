<p>Postoperative problems affecting the cheekbones include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Relapse from the place of <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture">reduction</a>        (the process of returning broken bones to their correct
        position) if the bones are not, or inadequately fixed
        (held in place by plates and screws or wires). This used
        to be a regular problem before internal fixation of fractures
        became widespread.</li>
    <li>Compression of the infraorbital nerve (the sensory nerve
        that innervates the upper lip, parts of the nose and
        the lower eyelid, one on each side of the face) can result
        in <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">neuropathic pain</a>.</li>
    <li>Double vision and epiphora (tearing) can be a problem if
        the orbital floors or walls (eye socket) are involved.</li>
    <li>Epistaxis (nosebleed) if there is bleeding into the maxillary
        sinus (air filled space above the upper jaw).</li>
    <li>Scars that will affect the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/cheeks">cheek</a>.</li>
    <li>Ectropion and entropion, when scarring pulls the lower eyelid
        out (ectropion) or in (entropion).</li>
    <li>Incorrect positioning of bone(s), leading to an over-prominent
        or sunken cheekbone.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>        over the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/cheeks">cheek</a>.</li>
</ul>
