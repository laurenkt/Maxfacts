<p>Collagen is the umbrella term for a range of common, naturally
    occurring proteins that give structure and strength to tissues,
    mainly as the prime component of connective tissues in all
    vertebrates. Collagen-type proteins are the most common proteins
    in mammals, accounting for approximately a third of the body’s
    proteins. There are dozens of varieties of collagen fibres,
    with different degrees of tensile strength, rigidity and
    compliance. A range of properties is necessary so that collagen
    fibres with optimised behaviours can be matched to different
    types of tissues and functions.  </p>

<p>Figure 1 depicts the overall triple-helix structure of collagen
    fibres. Each strand is made up by peptide chains. Slightly
    different compositions in terms of amino acids in the peptide
    chain account for slightly different mechanical properties
    of the resulting collagen fibres, with fairly rigid collagen
    in bone, slightly less rigid varieties in cartilage or tendon,
    and compliant varieties in skin. Collagen fibres are also
    found in dentine in teeth, in blood vessels, in the digestive
    system, in the eyes (cornea) and in muscle tissue.</p>
<p>This versatile biopolymer has a number of biomedical applications.
    Collagens are biodegradable and highly biocompatible, have
    only weak antigenicity, are non-toxic and are compatible
    with other synthetic polymers, easily available in abundance,
    straightforward to modify and typically have more favourable
    properties than other biopolymers such as albumin or <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">gelatin (denatured collagen)</a>.
    Unfortunately, highly purified type I collagen is fairly
    expensive and has variable properties (as all natural products
    do) and carries some small infection risks (for example,
    bovine spongiform encephalopathy when obtained from cattle).
    This is the reason why increasingly collagen products are
    being manufactured from marine creatures.</p>
<p>Collagen products can be manufactured as films, sheets, discs
    or sponges, as well as injectable suspensions.</p>
<p>Collagen products are probably best known for their non-medical
    uses, including cosmetic applications and food supplements.
    Cosmetic applications include subcutaneous injections of
    soluble collagen fractions as dermal (skin) or lip fillers.
    The plumping-up effects of such injections lasts for several
    months. The surface-active properties of collagen preparations
    are exploited in products aiming to protect hair and skin
    against the effects of detergents. Claimed benefits of collagen
    preparations as food supplements are unproven. A moment of
    critical thinking would probably be enough to convince oneself
    that it is not worth spending large amounts of money on such
    supplements: the amino acids in collagen products are not
    in any way different from those in a range of decent foods
    as part of a <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">balanced diet</a>.
    It should also be kept in mind that such products are not
    considered medicinal, so are not subject to the same rigid
    tests and assessments as medical products.</p>
<p>The most important medical applications of collagen products
    are as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>drug delivery systems;</li>
    <li>as tissue scaffolds in reconstructive surgery;</li>
    <li>as wound dressings in a range of situations, especially in
        the treatment of severe burns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collagen sponges have a long history of nearly 100 years as <strong>wound dressings</strong>.
    Their unique properties help to absorb large quantities of
    exudate, wounds are kept moist, and are protected against
    mechanical harm as well as (to some extent) <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bacterial infections</a>.
    Collagen sheets can also be manufactured such that they provide
    elastic sealants for surgical wounds. In a wider sense, collagen
    products have a role beyond traditional wound dressing by
    providing ‘artificial skin’ (sometimes also referred to as
    soft tissue engineering, encouraging skin regeneration after
    burns or other extended <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage/getting-started">skin damage</a>    by acting as scaffold, adhesive and sealant simultaneously.
    Similar applications exist in ophthalmology in treating the
    cornea (outer layer of the eye).</p>
<p>Collagen fibres are found almost everywhere in the body, thus
    many different <strong>reconstructive surgical specialties</strong>    take advantage of these materials. <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">Haemostatic properties</a>    (stopping bleeding) are generally advantageous. More specifically,
    collagen preparations play a role in general wound repair
    (and dressing), nerve repair, as prostheses and vascular
    grafts for damaged blood vessels, a range of orthopaedic
    surgical reconstructions of tendon, cartilage, ligaments
    and bone, in urology (haemodialysis).</p>
<p>The versatility of collagen preparations is particularly useful
    to exploit these materials as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">drug delivery</a>    vehicles in many different ways. For example, collagen materials
    can deliver slow-release of drugs in a highly controlled
    way. Collagen sponges are particularly useful to deliver
    locally high concentrations of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>,
    with very low serum concentrations of the drug. Collagen
    sponges containing gentamicin are widely used for such purposes
    in orthopaedic surgery, but also in maxillofacial surgery.
    More specialised preparations can be used to deliver genetically
    modified cells to target regions, or to provide controlled
    morphogenetic proteins locally for hard tissue regeneration.</p>
