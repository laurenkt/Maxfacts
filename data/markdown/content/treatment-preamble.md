<p>Depending on your condition and the decisions made, after
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z">diagnosis</a> (which we recommend you read first), about
        the most suitable treatment you may be faced with a range
        of different treatments, including <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>,
        <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>,
        <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> or a range of various <a href="/treatment/other">other treatment options</a>.
            While you will be supported through all stages of
            your treatment by the professionals involved, it
            is still highly desirable that you understand all
            aspects of your treatment. It helps you to engage
            with and not be intimidated by the experience.</p>
<p>Understanding the treatment(s) you are undergoing also helps
    you to have <a href="/treatment/timelines">realistic expectations</a>    in the short and long term. Not only does this avoid frustrations
    arising from unrealistic expectations, it also helps you
    and your aftercare team to be aware of potential early warning
    signs when things do not go exactly according to plan.</p>
<p>Your overall treatment plan, especially after major surgery and/or
    radiotherapy, may include <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative dentistry</a>    as the final treatment stage. Your restorative dentistry
    consultant and their team will have been involved with your
    treatment planning from the start. If after lengthy periods
    of treatment you may be a bit tired of even more interventions,
    do carry on â€“ it is worth it to have function and your smile
    restored as well as possible. It also gives closure after
    what may have been a stressful and tough period in your life.</p>
