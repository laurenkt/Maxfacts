<p>Humans, like all other vertebrates, in the course of evolution
    have developed a sophisticated closed blood circulatory system.
    Basically a pump, the heart powers this fluid transport system
    and helps to ensure that flow is maintained in this high-pressure
    system according to the need of tissues.</p>
<p>The upside of such a highly regulated system is its incredible
    flexibility and versatility in transporting materials to
    and from every area of the body, such as nutrients, oxygen,
    water, hormones, removal of spent metabolic materials, CO<sub>2</sub>,
    and so on. The downside of such a circulatory system is the
    critical dependence of the body’s survival on the uninterrupted
    function of this transport system – and the need for the
    body to maintain mechanisms to protect the system against
    injury and to provide emergency repair strategies.</p>
<p>Leakage of blood from the circulatory system (haemorrhage) after
    injury must be stopped and blood must be kept inside a damaged
    blood vessel (haemostasis) in order to keep a body alive.
    Blood carries its own emergency supplies for such situations.
    All the biochemical components allowing for emergency response
    and initial repair to stop bleeding, circulate in an inactive
    form with the blood flow all the time, but are ready to be
    activated instantaneously. Despite escalating body responses
    to bleeding, there are narrow limits to the extent of injury
    and blood loss a body can deal with on its own.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are multiple close relationships between the
    general themes of ‘bleeding’ and ‘surgery’, oral &amp; maxillofacial
    surgery is no exception. On the one hand, emergency surgical
    interventions are often needed to stop bleeding after
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage">trauma</a> and to repair damage to tissues, including blood
        vessels. On the other hand, surgical interventions necessarily
        cause damage to blood vessels and bleeding. Any conditions
        that change the normal blood clotting behaviour (either
        resulting from disease or from <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">various medications</a>)
        have an impact on the risk of surgical interventions
        and/or recovery, as well as chances of success or failure
        of surgical treatments.</p>
<p>With this close relationship in mind, next we briefly explore
    the <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">normal body response to injury and bleeding</a>,
    before discussing what can (and does) go wrong with bleeding
    and blood flow, and what can be done to <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">remedy such bleeding and blood-flow problems</a>.</p>
