    <li>how the bone remodelling process works normally to maintain
        a healthy bone structure throughout life;</li>

</ul>
<p>The discussion is a brief account of the current ideas about
    some of the bone remodelling processes. It outlines a work
    in progress in many different regards. In particular, some
    effects of high-energy radiation and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">bioavailability</a>    of bisphosphonates and other <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive medications</a>    (see below) on healthy bone tissue are only incompletely
    understood. Better understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology
    of bone remodelling is vital in order to be able to design
    rational <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue">treatment schemes</a>,
    in particular where medications or exposure to high-energy
    radiation are the cause of bone necrosis.</p>
<h1 id="the-bone-remodelling-process">The bone remodelling process</h1>
<h2>The general macroscopic picture</h2>
<p>Bones have structural and motor functions, as well as being a
    mineral reservoir (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions). Remodelling of
    bones is a life-long renewal process, necessary to retain
    bone strength and to maintain healthy Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion
    levels in plasma. It is estimated that approximately 5 to
    10 % of the skeleton of an adult is renewed over the period
    of a year. There are two types of bone tissue. Overall cortical
    bone makes up approximately 80 % of the skeleton. It is a
    heavily mineralised, mechanically strong bone tissue and
    its main task is to maintain structure and to provide protection
    of delicate tissues. Cancellous (‘spongy’) bone makes up
    the remaining approximately 20 % of the skeletal bone. Cancellous
    bone is much softer than cortical bone and because of its
    spongy, porous structure has a large surface area that allows
    for its high metabolic activity. The distribution of cortical
    and cancellous bone tissue is not uniform, it varies with
    the roles of different bones in the body. The mandible, like
    the ilium (part of the hip bone) and tibia (shinbone), has
    a relatively large amount of cancellous bone in adulthood,
    whereas the maxilla comprises thin sheets of cortical bone.
    The zygoma (cheekbone) and calvarium (skullcap) are essentially
    dense cortical bone with a thin layer of cancellous bone
    like the filling in a sandwich.</p>
<p>The bone tissue itself is a masterpiece of tissue / composite
    material engineering – it is a light-weight, yet mechanically
    strong material. The bone mineral component (calcium hydroxyl
    apatite (Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>),
    a phosphate mineral with an intricate three-dimensional structure)
    provides stiffness. The organic component, the bone matrix,
    is mostly made up from partially ordered collagen fibres
    (with further proteins hosted in the tissue) and makes bones
    tough and resistant to fracture. A particular interwoven
    and partially aligned architecture of mineral and organic
    components in this composite material bone achieves these
    amazing mechanical properties. Bone conditions that lead
    to an overall distorted architecture of bone tissue (for
    example, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">Paget’s disease</a>)
    from chaotic remodelling processes thus weaken the bone.</p>
<h2>The general microscopic picture</h2>
<p>The two main players in the bone remodelling process, in addition
    to extensive signalling pathways for coordination (see below),
    are osteoclasts and osteoblasts. These are specialist types
    of cells, which together execute the bone remodelling process
    in a highly integrated and coordinated manner. Osteoclasts
    are responsible for the resorption of spent / old bone tissue,
    osteoblasts are the cells that lay down new bone tissue.
    It is important for this process to be well orchestrated,
    balanced and to proceed in such a way that the resulting
    overall volume and strength / structure of bone is not altered,
    and that the renewal process itself does not unduly weaken
    the bone temporarily.</p>
<p>The renewal process is systemically triggered by parathyroid
    hormone (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/pth">PTH</a>)
    when Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion levels are low, osteoclasts are
    then generally activated. Many different hormones play a
    role in bone remodelling, amongst these, oestrogen has a
    major influence. Oestrogen reduces osteoclast activity, promotes
    osteoclast <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">apoptosis</a>    as well as osteoblast activity. These activities typically
    are in balance in women before menopause. When oestrogen
    levels fall steeply in older women after menopause, an imbalance
    of the bone remodelling process results. That could be within
    the boundaries of the normal ageing process. However, this
    can be problematic if the rate of remodelling activation
    and bone resorption increases significantly but there is
    not an equivalent balanced degree of quality-bone rebuilding.
    Altogether this cycle then leads to a growing imbalance of
    bone remodelling over time (osteoporosis) and results in
    significantly weakened bones. It is this cycle that some
    widely prescribed medications for the treatment of osteoporosis
    aim to interrupt (see below).</p>
<p>Locally, micro-damage and/or mechanical load to the bone are
    thought to be sensed by osteocytes (osteocytes are a type
    of cells to which osteoblasts revert once their bone-building
    task is completed and they get embedded in the newly formed
    bone tissue (osteoid) / bone matrix; osteocytes are the most
    common type of cells in bone) which then release signalling
    to activate the local remodelling process by activation of
    osteoclasts.</p>
<h2>The local chronology of events in bone remodelling</h2>
<p>Figure 1 gives a simplified cartoon version of the local events
    in the bone remodelling process.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-necrosis-hard-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Schematic illustration of the
        steps in the bone remodelling process.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The bone remodelling process can be activated locally and/or
    systemically. The local <strong>activation</strong> signal
    in an area of a bone lesion stems from the apoptosis of osteocytes
    which activates osteoclasts. The systemic triggers are hormonally
    controlled feedback loops. Once the process is activated,
    locally or systemically, a temporary cluster of the active
    cellular units assembles. These basic multicellular units
    (BMU) form a work unit with specific allocated tasks for
    all its members. It is a highly spatially and temporally
    organised unit which needs multiple signalling and feedback
    paths for it to function properly. The ‘get ready’ signalling
    protein (RANKL) after activation is issued by osteoblast
    cells. RANKL binds to the RANK receptor of osteoclast precursor
    cells and activates those into fully developed mature osteoclasts
    that are subsequently recruited to the remodelling site.
    There is an antagonist (opposite player) protein to counteract
    the effects of RANKL: osteoprotegerin (OPG) is also released
    by osteoblast cells, it is regulated by the hormone oestrogen
    and reduces the formation of mature osteoclasts. The RANKL/RANK/OPG
    interplay is vital to keep bone formation and resorption
    in balance.</p>
<p>The working front end of the BMU in the <strong>resorption phase</strong>    of bone remodelling are the mature osteoclasts. Osteoclasts
    are large multinuclear cells with ruffled borders. This helps
    to attach to the surface of the bone defect and seal it.
    Next the osteoclasts release enzymes to digest the organic
    bone matter (mostly collagen fibres) and acid to dissolve
    the inorganic bone mineral. The osteoclast action creates
    space for new bone tissue but leaves some debris behind,
    mostly consisting of undigested collagen fibres and fragments.</p>
<p>This calls into action the so-called <strong>reversal</strong>    cells which follow the paths of the osteoblasts and prepare
    the bone surface for the deposition of new bone material.
    Reversal cells remove the remaining debris and cover the
    surface. The exact nature (phenotype) of reversal cells is
    a matter of debate but it has been established recently that
    these cells belong to the lineage of osteoblast cells and
    thus are probably not just a specialised type of macrophage
    (cell that specialises in engulfing and digesting material).
    There may be differences in the reversal cells and reversal
    phase of bone remodelling in different mammals, hence experimental
    findings across species need to be interpreted cautiously.
    The final stage of the reversal phase is for the reversal
    cells to transmit and receive signalling to move on to the
    next stage of the process.</p>
<p>The <strong>formation phase</strong> of bone remodelling directs
    osteoblasts to the sites of bone resorption where they facilitate
    the formation of new bone tissue. The biochemical signalling
    pathways and exact mechanisms of this crucial stage of the
    bone remodelling process remain controversial.</p>
<p>Once osteoblasts have arrived at the remodelling site, these
    cells produce molecules that are the starting materials for
    the formation of new bone tissue. Primarily collagen fibres
    are deposited but also further proteins and lipids. This
    forms a kind of template (the osteoid) onto which the bone
    mineral components (calcium hydroxyl apatite (Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>)
    are deposited. This mineralisation process starts about two
    weeks after the initial deposit of osteoid by the osteoblasts,
    it continues for about six months and concludes in a late
    phase of secondary mineralisation and consolidation over
    two to three years. The exact mechanism of this process is
    not yet fully understood, it continues long after the osteoblasts
    and reversal cells have left the scene.</p>
<p>Once the missing volume of bone has been replaced, the process
    is locally <strong>terminated</strong>. It is thought that
    osteocytes play a signalling role at this stage but this
    hypothesis needs further investigations. Once the new bone
    tissue is mineralised, the osteoblasts either undergo
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">apoptosis (programmed, orderly cell death)</a>, or restructure
        and become bone-lining cells or osteocytes embedded in
        the mineralised bone matrix.</p>
<p>We have taken a fair number of short cuts in this description.
    The bone remodelling process is more intricate with many
    more regulation, feedback and control cycles involved than
    our brief description implies. There are also several currently
    unanswered fundamental questions about the biochemistry and
    physiology of the process. For example, the roles of immune
    cells in general and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammatory</a>    messaging are not well understood but are likely of clinical
    importance in the treatment of bone conditions.</p>
<h1 id="interference-of-high-energy-radiation-with-the-bone-remodelling-process">Interference of high-energy radiation with the bone remodelling
    process</h1>
<p>The destructive effects of high-energy radiation on healthy bone
    tissue were first described nearly 100 years ago (‘radiation
    osteitis’), yet to this day the understanding of the underlying
    pathophysiology remains incomplete. One intriguing question
    awaiting a comprehensive answer is: why is the mandible (lower
    jaw bone) so particularly vulnerable to radiation damage
    resulting in ORN? A relatively high bone turnover rate of
    the mandible alone does not appear to offer an exhaustive
    explanation. However, a high bone turnover rate combined
    with a particularly high risk of infections (for a variety
    of reasons; see below) and a reduced vascular supply in comparison
    with the maxilla (upper jaw) would seem a logical starting
    point for initial explanations.</p>
<p>A short history of the hypotheses about the pathophysiology of
    osteoradionecrosis (ORN) includes the following views:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An established view of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) over several
        decades describes the condition as the result of the
        combined effects of hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular
        tissue from radiation damage, leading to breakdown in
        the form of bone necrosis; this hypothesis does not explicitly
        consider <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>        as an important contributing factor.</li>
    <li>Vascular damage, in particular to the inferior alveolar artery
        (which runs in the mandibular (lower jaw) canal and supplies
        the mandible and lower molar teeth) has been highlighted
        as a weak link.</li>
    <li>It was repeatedly pointed out that high-energy radiation
        causes irreparable damage to osteoclasts (see above),
        which leads to dysregulation of the bone remodelling
        processes and over time causes bone tissue breakdown.
        This hypothesis emphasizes some of the similarities of
        ORN with osteonecrosis caused by some medications (MRONJ;
        see below).</li>
    <li>The role of (bacterial and fungal) <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>        in the development of ORN has been widely discussed,
        highlighted and demonstrated in several studies; it continues
        to be confirmed.</li>
    <li>The most recent thinking about the pathophysiology of ORN
        ascribes its development to a fibroatrophic mechanism
        (the simultaneous occurrence of fibrosis (scarring) and
        atrophy (wasting) in irradiated tissue). It essentially
        interprets ORN as the catastrophic long-term result of
        the body’s attempts to repair radiation damage. The mechanism
        includes the effects of free radicals, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>,
        microvascular thrombosis and dysfunction of endothelial
        (lining) cells, leading to fibrosis and atrophy by preventing
        a normal bone remodelling process, before eventually
        ORN is established.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mechanism is thought to process in three stages over several
    years: i) an initial acute inflammatory phase (a pre-fibrotic
    phase) which is mainly concerned with endothelial cells;
    ii) a constitutive (chaotic) phase which is mainly characterised
    by increasingly abnormal activity of fibroblasts and loss
    of organisation of extracellular tissue; iii) a late fibro-atrophic
    phase with repeated attempts of tissue remodelling with the
    formation of fragile tissues which are vulnerable to injury
    and repeated inflammation from even very minor insults.</p>
<p>This proposed mechanism bears some similarities with the traditional
    ORN model (hypoxia, hypovascularity, hypocellularity; see
    above) in that it does not emphasize the role of infections.</p>
<p>The main weakness of this fibroatrophic-mechanism hypothesis
    is that it was actually developed to explain long term
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">soft tissue necrosis</a> that occurs, for example, after
        <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> to
        treat breast cancer. There are clearly differences in
        the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">wound healing</a>        processes of hard and soft tissues, as well as in the
        regular remodelling and renewal processes of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">soft</a>        and hard tissues. It has so far not been convincingly
        explained how a soft-tissue based model can be seamlessly
        applied to hard tissue (cellular and molecular biology
        studies of microscopic events in the development of necrosis,
        quoted as supporting this model of ORN development, focus
        on the study of soft tissues).</p>
<p>Recent histological investigations of resection specimens of
    mandibular ORN reveal that necrosis of cortical bone, especially
    near the inferior border of the mandible, is more common
    than necrosis of cancellous bone. This finding has been tentatively
    ascribed to a decrease in or lack of periosteal blood supply.</p>
<p>It would be clearly highly desirable to arrive at a more robust
    idea about the pathophysiology of ORN in order to enable
    better, rational <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue">treatment schemes</a>    for this condition.</p>
<h1 id="interference-of-medications-with-the-bone-remodelling-process">Interference of medications with the bone remodelling process</h1>
<p>Recalling the multiple steps and multiple regulation cycles and
    signalling pathways of the bone remodelling process, it is
    obvious that there will be as many opportunities for the
    treatment of bone diseases by medications as there are opportunities
    for things to go wrong and for unintended consequences to
    develop. The list of such medicinal drugs in use (or being
    trialled) is long and growing. In addition, some medicinal
    drugs that are used for other treatment purposes also have
    a profound effect on bone remodelling.</p>
<h2>Bisphosphonates</h2>
<p>The most widely used class of medicinal drugs for the treatment
    of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">osteoporosis</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">bone metastases</a>    is the group of so-called <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>    (commonly abbreviated as BP). This class of drugs shares
    a common motive (Figure 2) of two phosphonate groups linked
    by a -CR<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>- unit.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-necrosis-hard-level3-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The generic structure of bisphosphonates.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Depending on the chemical nature of the substituents R<sup>1</sup>,
    R<sup>2</sup> in the molecule, the potency of bisphosphonates
    as antiresorptive agents varies widely and covers 4 orders
    of magnitude of potency. MRONJ from BP treatment currently
    is considered the most common form of osteonecrosis of the
    jaw (as a result of the very large number of people on long
    term BP treatment).</p>
<p>Bisphosphonates tend to bind strongly to the surface of bone
    (where the uptake is preferential and where they remain for
    a very long time) in remodelling sites, chelate Ca<sup>2+</sup>    ions, prevent osteoclast formation, hinder osteoclast function
    and promote osteoclast apoptosis in several ways, mainly
    by BP’s being engulfed by osteoclasts. The altered osteoclast
    profiles in MRONJ differ slightly from those in ORN.</p>
<p>Altogether the main BP effect will thus be a reduction in the
    resorption phase of the bone remodelling process and this
    should be expected to contribute toward strengthened bones.
    The list of actions of BP’s on osteoclasts gives a hint why
    tooth extractions are a common trigger event for MRONJ under
    BP treatment, significantly more often than for ORN (see
    above). The extraction socket is not only vulnerable to infection,
    it is also an exposed remodelling site. There is some evidence
    that the function of osteocytes (signalling of mechanical
    load status) and osteoblasts (altered mineralisation) is
    also directly affected by BP’s. In the longer term the presence
    of BP molecules embedded in the bone structure leads to changes
    in the mechanical properties of bone by disrupting the normal
    bone architecture by patchy MRONJ lesions (which has been
    tentatively ascribed to a local immunosuppressive effect
    of BP molecules). This is in slight contrast to histopathology
    findings in ORN where bone lesions tend to be more homogeneous
    and necrosis more extensive. Periosteal viability tends to
    be significantly higher in MRONJ than in ORN (with consequences
    for <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue">treatment options</a>,
    where conservative surgical approaches for MRONJ are more
    successful than for ORN).</p>
<h2>Denusomab</h2>
<p>Denusomab is a human monoclonal antibody, that is an antibody
    designed to bind to just one type of receptor. Denusomab
    competes with RANKL (see above) for binding to the RANK receptor,
    with great affinity for RANK. Accordingly, denusomab inhibits
    bone resorption by inhibiting the development of mature osteoclasts
    from precursor cells. Other than bisphosphonates, denusomab
    does not alter the biomechanical properties of bone. It also
    has a shorter life span in the body than bisphosphonates,
    its effects on bone remodelling decrease significantly approximately
    6 months after treatment cessation.</p>
<h2>Other agents interacting with the bone remodelling process</h2>
<p>During the resorption phase of the bone remodelling process,
    mature osteoclasts secret a lytic enzyme (cathepsin K) for
    the dissolution of collagen fibres. This role was identified
    as another promising target for antiresorptive drugs. Several
    inhibitors of cathepsin K have been developed, only one of
    these (odanacatib) has so far progressed to clinical trials
    for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Despite
    promising effects on bone strength, these trials have not
    led to further commercial development of the inhibitor as
    trials revealed increased stroke risk.</p>
<p>Sclerostin is a protein that is produced by osteocytes and forms
    part of the osteocytes’ self-regulation / feedback loops;
    its main effect is a reduction of activity in the bone formation
    phase of the bone remodelling process (it is a counterplayer
    to PTH’s effects on bone remodelling). Sclerostin is specific
    to bone metabolism, which makes it an attractive target to
    counteract with an antibody, aiming to increase bone formation.
    Romosozumab is such an antibody currently undergoing clinical
    trials (2017), several other inhibitors of sclerostin are
    being developed.</p>
<p>Teriparatide is a protein closely related to the parathyroid
    hormone (PTH). It increases osteoblast activity and thus
    enhances bone formation. It is occasionally used to treat
    high-risk osteoporosis and to enhance the healing of fractures
    but is contraindicated for people at risk of developing
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">osteosarcoma</a>.</p>
<p>We mention some of these uncommon and/or newly developed medicinal
    agents to provide more context and an outlook to further
    developments – which may or may not present further ONJ challenges
    in the future. In addition, these selected cases illustrate
    the logic behind the common choice of antiresorptive drugs
    for the treatment of osteoporosis in particular. They are
    the lesser evil: reducing the resorption of bone, as opposed
    to increasing the formation of bone, is the less risky strategy
    especially for long term treatments. Exploiting general growth
    factors as systemic pharmaceuticals, or uninhibiting growth
    mechanisms in other ways carries an inherent risk of encouraging
    unintended malignant growth.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiangiogenic"><strong>Antiangiogenics</strong></a>    are a group of medicinal drugs which hinder blood-vessel
    growth in various different ways. They are a (controversial)
    type of medication used in the treatment of malignant tumours,
    with the idea that preventing the growth of new blood vessels
    to supply tumour tissue will ‘starve’ the tumour.</p>
<p>The most common of these agents are bevacizumab, sunitinib and
    sorafenib. The different substances block different growth
    factors for vascular (blood vessel) growth. These medications
    are administered systemically, hence their action also affects
    healthy tissue and blood vessels. The mandible is vulnerable
    to impairment of its vascular supply and MRONJ following
    treatment with antiangiogenics has been reported.</p>
