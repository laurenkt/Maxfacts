<h1 id="signs-and-symptoms-of-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaws-onj">Signs and symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ)</h1>
<p>The signs and symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ) include
    exposure of necrotic bone, ulceration and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z">mucosal (soft tissue in the mouth) necrosis</a>    without healing tendencies, accompanied by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">pain</a>.
    Depending on the underlying cause, acute symptoms may include
    swelling, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">mucositis</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">disturbed sensation</a>.
    Over time an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">oro-cutaneous fistula</a>    may develop from chronic infection, a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">pathological fracture</a>    of the mandible may occur, teeth may be lost and pieces of
    necrotic bone (such a piece is called a sequestrum) may be
    shed, usually through the mucosa.</p>
<p>Even where the underlying cause of ONJ is not a specific infection,
    the affected areas frequently carry a high load of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">microbial agents</a>    and sometimes show a shift to more specific and pathologic
    cultures.</p>
<p>The destruction of bone by osteonecrosis of the jaws makes severe
    ONJ a debilitating condition, leading to serious functional
    impairment of speech, chewing and eating in general with
    a background of often intractable chronic pain.</p>

        lead to the development of bone necrosis, this information

<h1 id="osteoradionecrosis-orn">Osteoradionecrosis (ORN)</h1>
<p>In spite of improved <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">modulated radiotherapy irradiation</a>    schemes, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains the most important
    long-term complication of radiotherapy applied to the head
    &amp; neck region (apart from further damage such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry mouth)</a>,
    distorted taste, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing)</a>,
    reduced mobility of the tongue. The location of the tumour
    necessitating radiotherapy, as sole treatment modality or
    after surgery, as well as the radiation dose are correlated
    with the occurrence and severity of ORN. The risk is increased
    with higher total dose, larger fraction dosage and larger
    irradiated volumes,</p>
<p>ORN may occur many years after completion of radiotherapy treatment.
    This is likely related to the lasting increased vulnerability
    to the oral mucosa to even minor irritation. After irradiation
    the risk for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">soft tissue necrosis</a>    of the oral mucosa remains high. For example, ill-fitting
    dentures can represent an ongoing irritation and thus an
    increased risk for the development of necrosis.</p>
<p>95 % of ORN occurs in the mandible (the lower jaw bone). It is
    often associated with extractions of teeth in a previously
    irradiated mandible. The general dental practitioners and
    restorative dentistry specialists have an important role
    in preventing this complication.</p>
<p>ORN can be defined as <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">irradiated bone</a>    which becomes devitalised and exposed through the overlying
    skin or mucosa without healing for three months, without
    recurrence of tumour.</p>
<p>After clinical examination and taking of a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">dental panoramic tomography (DPT)</a>    image, mandibular ORN cases can be classified as follows
    (Notani classification):</p>
<ul>
    <li>ORN confined to the dentoalveolar (immediately surrounding
        teeth) bone;</li>
    <li>ORN limited to dentoalveolar bone or mandible above the inferior
        dental canal (hollow tube inside the mandibular bone,
        housing nerves and blood vessels), or both;</li>
    <li>ORN involving the mandible below the inferior dental canal,
        and/or pathological fracture, and/or skin fistula.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several theories attempting to explain the pathophysiology
    of ORN.</p>

    conditions.</p>

<h1 id="medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaws-mronj">Medication Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws (MRONJ)</h1>
<p>A number of drugs can cause medication related osteonecrosis
    of the jaws (MRONJ). MRONJ is defined by the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>presence of exposed bone (or bone that can be probed through
        an intraoral or extraoral <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistula</a>)
        in the maxillofacial region over a period of 8 weeks;</li>
    <li>current or previous treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive</a>        or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiangiogenic">antiangiogenic</a>        agents;</li>
    <li>no history of radiation therapy to the jaw or obvious
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastatic disease</a> to the jaw.</li>
</ul>
<p>MRONJ is a complication of treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive"><strong>antiresorptive agents</strong></a>.
    These medications are prescribed to treat a number of bone
    disorders. This type of medication hinders the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">normal bone remodelling process</a>    by interfering in various different ways with the resorption
    of bone and is thus used for treatments aiming at strengthening
    bone. There are different types of antiresorptive agents
    (the group of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/denusomab">denusomab</a>    and an ever increasing number of agents that interfere with
    the various biochemical signaling pathways involved in bone
    remodelling) which work by different interactions with the
    bone remodelling process. MRONJ in the mandible (lower jaw
    bone) is more common than in the maxilla (upper jaw bone),
    approximately 2 : 1.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about the different pathophysiology
        mechanisms of MRONJ, this information is on the following
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">detailed page about hard tissue necrosis</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Antiresorptive medications are widely used to treat osteoporosis
    (brittle bones, in particular in women after menopause);
    for example, 1.7 million people are on long-term treatment
    with antiresorptive agents in Germany (2017). The second
    indication for antiresorptive agents is in the management
    of bone <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>    from a range of malignancies (including breast, kidney, prostate,
    some brain tumours) or bone deposits from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">haematological malignancies</a>    such as multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>MRONJ has been reported in 1 to 20 % of patients with bone metastases,
    the rate of MRONJ in osteoporosis treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>    is much lower, approximately 0.1 to 2 % of patients are affected.
    However, given the large number of people on long-term treatment
    with antiresorptive agents, even a small percentage of MRONJ
    complications equates to a significant number of people suffering
    from MRONJ. The risk for MRONJ is higher when antiresorptive
    agents are administered intravenously than for oral delivery.
    The risk for MRONJ increases with dose and duration of treatment.
    In particular for treatment with bisphosphonates, MRONJ is
    a long term risk as these agents become firmly embedded in
    the bone matrix where they remain for many years (more than
    15 years has been reported).</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiangiogenic"><strong>Antiangiogenic drugs</strong></a>    are another potential cause of MRONJ. Antiangiogenics are
    specialized cancer treatment drugs that target the growth
    of blood vessels feeding a tumour, essentially aiming to
    starve the tumour. Their mode of action can impact on the
    vascularization of the jaws and thus lead to MRONJ <i>via</i>    an impaired blood supply to the bone.</p>
<p>Chronic exposure to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/steroids">steroids</a>    causes osteoporosis but it is difficult to extract evidence
    for the direct involvement of steroids in causing MRONJ.
    However, combined with bisphosphonate treatment of osteoporosis,
    steroids seem to make MRONJ more likely and/or worse.</p>
<p>Similar to the classification of osteoradionecrosis (ORN; see
    above) there is a clinical staging scheme of MRONJ:</p>
<ul>
    <li>at risk category: no apparent exposed/necrotic bone in patients
        who have been treated with either oral or intravenous
        bisphosphonates;</li>
    <li>stage 1: exposed/necrotic bone in patients who are asymptomatic
        and have no evidence of infection;</li>
    <li>stage 2: exposed/necrotic bone associated with infection
        as evidenced by pain and erythema (redness of skin) in
        the region of the exposed bone, with or without purulent
        drainage (pus);</li>
    <li>stage 3: exposed/necrotic bone in patients with pain, infection
        and one or more of the following: pathological fracture,
        extra-oral fistula, or osteolysis extending to the inferior
        border of the mandible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 4 and Figure 5 show examples of MRONJ of the maxilla and
    mandible, respectively.</p>

</aside>
<h1 id="other-causes-of-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaws">Other causes of osteonecrosis of the jaws</h1>
<p>Osteonecrosis of the jaws from the two major causes (see above),
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> applied
    to the head and neck region and systemic treatment with
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive medications</a> is on the rise. It may sound
        slightly bizarre but the reasons for this significant
        increase in the number of ONJ resulting from these two
        causes are actually positive: more people with head and
        neck cancers live longer, and most people live to older
        age in general – which increases the probability of having
        treatment with some antiresorptive agents at some point
        and live long enough afterwards to be confronted with
        the unwanted treatment effects. Clearly, better strategies
        and methods to prevent ONJ would be highly desirable.</p>
<p>ONJ resulting from other causes includes a fair number of different
    potential causes but altogether they make up a small minority
    of ONJ cases.</p>
<p>Of these other possible causes underlying osteonecrosis of the
    jaws, the most prominent ones are a range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info"><strong>infections</strong></a>.
    These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>bacterial infections, including actinomycosis, syphilis,
        tuberculosis, noma;</li>
    <li>viral infections, including HIV, herpes zoster (shingles);</li>
    <li>fungal infections, including aspergillosis, mucormycosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Local or regional invasive <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer"><strong>growth of malignancies</strong></a>    can include the jaws and lead to ONJ. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture"><strong>Trauma</strong></a>,
    be it related to accidents or surgery (for example, following
    osteotomies (cutting of bone) in <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">orthognathic surgery</a>    (corrective surgery for jaw disproportions) or other maxillofacial
    surgery), can be a cause for ONJ. A <strong>range of long term conditions</strong>    such as diabetes or arteriosclerosis and some haematological
    disorders carry an increased risk of ONJ development, most
    likely related to impaired vascular and blood supply to the
    jaw bones. <strong>Chemical irritants</strong> can trigger
    ONJ; examples being the tissue damage caused by long term
    <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/other">cocaine snorting</a>, or
    by sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, used in dental practice in
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">root canal treatment</a>,
    when extruded through the apex of the tooth root into the
    adjacent bone; some materials used as ‘fillers’ in root canal
    treatment can cause similar problems.  </p>
<p>However varied the collection of ‘other causes for ONJ’, there
    is one unifying aspect. In all these cases treatment / cure
    of the underlying condition / problem is also curative for
    the ONJ. This is distinctly different from ONJ caused by
    radiotherapy or antiresorptive medications. These differences
    obviously have a profound impact on the <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis">treatment and management</a>    of the different varieties of osteonecrosis of the jaws.</p>
