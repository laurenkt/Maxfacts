<p>We want to encourage you to prepare your own foods, in suitable
    textures and at comfortable temperatures depending exactly
    on your needs and appetite. Or, possibly you might want to
    encourage friends and family to help you with some cooking
    â€“ and with sharing the products!</p>
<p>In our collection of <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">Maxfacts recipes</a>    we say repeatedly that most of the recipes are easy to prepare.
    Our cooking videos demonstrate exactly that, for a number
    of flexible general preparations of a variety of foods in
    textures that many find comfortable to eat:</p>
