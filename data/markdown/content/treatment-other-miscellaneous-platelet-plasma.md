<p>Plasma, the liquid component of blood, and the multiple
    crucial roles of platelets (small cellular fragments
    derived from specialised cells in bone marrow) in
    stopping bleeding, and initiating and supporting healing
    are described on our pages about <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">bleeding</a>.
</p>
<p>The term platelet-rich plasma (sometimes called platelet
    concentrate) refers to a process where somebody donates
    a small amount of their own blood, approximately 10 to
    20 ml. The plasma is separated from the other, solid
    blood components in a small centrifuge and thus is
    enriched in platelets relative to the full blood. The
    platelet-rich plasma is then applied to a surgical site,
    for example a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">bone
        graft</a> from the pelvis to cover a defect in the
    mandible. It is thought that the unique properties and
    various roles of platelets in wound healing may lead to
    earlier vascularisation and integration of the bone
    graft at the recipient site, if platelets are present at
    an enhanced concentration (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Helped by the ease with which autologous platelet-rich
    plasma can be obtained and applied, there is an
    approximately 25 year history of its use in various
    treatments of surgical wounds and injuries.
    Platelet-rich plasma is a cocktail of growth factors,
    cytokines and chemokines (messenger molecules), and some
    platelet aggregates. Most of the theories and hypotheses
    about the working mechanisms of platelet-rich plasma in
    wound healing of hard and soft tissues (including nerve
    repair) are derived from laboratory experiments and may
    not necessarily translate smoothly to the clinical
    situation. Some of the suggested mechanisms are
    controversially debated. A number of studies carried out
    on animal models, mostly rodents, demonstrate some
    capacity and potential for the use of platelet-rich
    plasma to improve wound healing but the multifactorial
    situation and the multiple known roles of platelets have
    so far not been fully elucidated. That is true for these
    animal models, and also for the use on humans.</p>
<p>Similar to the studies of other potential adjuvant
    therapies, such as <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/lilt">photobiomodulation</a>,
    there is no scarcity of publications. But because of the
    commonly poor design and quality of most of the studies,
    there is no conclusive evidence about the efficacy of
    the clinical use of platelet-rich plasma. The debate
    about merits, or lack of merits, of platelet-rich plasma
    in surgery continues, fuelled by poor data.</p>
<p>Clinical use of platelet-rich plasma has been reported in
    orthopaedic surgery (especially in the repair of tendon
    injuries), in the treatment of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal">periodontal
        disease</a> and related gingival surgery (with no
    convincing evidence from multiple studies), in the
    placement of <a href="/treatment-rest-denstistry-implants-level1">dental
        implants</a> (again, only conflicting evidence
    exists), there is some weak evidence that platelet-rich
    plasma may improve the remodelling and healing of bone
    grafts and reduce the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrosis</a> of local
    flaps in maxillofacial surgery, no statistically
    significant benefit of platelet-rich plasma on the
    healing of chronic wounds (such as diabetic ulcers) has
    been demonstrated from a large number of studies, the
    benefits of platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of
    neuropathic pain are controversial, at best.</p>
<p>Some have raised concerns that platelet-rich plasma may
    promote infections and may even play a role in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a>,
    given the dysfunction of platelets associated with
    sepsis. Combining information from a diverse range of
    studies looking into this aspect (for many different
    conditions and surgical interventions) actually seems to
    point toward antibacterial activity of platelet-rich
    plasma, as had been previously described in <i>in
        vitro</i> laboratory experiments.</p>
