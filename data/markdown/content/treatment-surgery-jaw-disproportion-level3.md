<h1 id="common-orthognathic-surgical-procedures">Common orthognathic surgical procedures</h1>
<p>The removal of third molars (wisdom teeth) prior to the orthognathic
    surgery is commonly performed in order to avoid poor splits.
    The presence of third molars during sagittal split osteotomies
    (see below) is not associated with an increased frequency
    of unfavourable fractures. Concomitant third molar removal
    in sagittal split osteotomies also decreases proximal segment
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">inferior alveolar nerve</a>    (nerve running in a hollow tube in the mandible) entrapment,
    but only slightly increases overall operating time.</p>

<h1 id="mandibular-procedures">Mandibular procedures</h1>
<h2>Ramus Surgery</h2>
<p>The mandibular ramus is the upward pointing part or the mandible,
    behind the lower teeth. Most mandibular corrective procedures
    in some way involve osteotomies (bone cuts) to this part
    of the mandible.</p>
<p><strong>Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO)</strong> is
    one of the most commonly performed and versatile mandibular
    procedures. Figure 1 shows the bone cuts involved.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Dry mandible markings for the
        bone cuts for the sagittal split osteotomy. Top: buccal
        (cheek-side) view; middle: anterior (front) view; bottom:
        lingual (tongue-side) view.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The bilateral sagittal split osteotomy can be used for backward
    or forward correction of the mandible in isolation, or in
    combination with a maxillary osteotomy (see below). It is
    usually performed under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>.
    It was originally described by Trauner and Obwegeser in 1957.
    The procedure has since undergone numerous modifications.</p>
<p>Even when there are large advancements, <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">bone grafting</a>    is rarely required due to the long bony interface between
    the two fragments. Indications for its use include mandibular
    advancement, mandibular setback, and correction of asymmetry.
    It is contraindicated in ramus hypoplasia, narrow lateral
    to medial ramus thickness and in severe asymmetries.</p>
<p>There are several advantages and disadvantages to BSSO.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the mandible can be advanced, set back or rotated in an axial
        plane to allow correction of asymmetry;</li>
    <li>rigid fixation can be employed, allowing early mobilisation
        of the mandible and easier management of the airway;</li>
    <li>healing is rapid with predictable bony union;</li>
    <li>good stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>unfavourable mandibular splitting may occur, such that rigid
        fixation is impossible;</li>
    <li>an incidence of inferior alveolar nerve damage which can
        lead altered sensation of the lower lip. Although this
        is usually temporary, permanent loss can occur. Interestingly,
        lingual nerve problems are rarely encountered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vertical subsigmoid osteotomy (VSS)</strong> is a relatively
    simple and rapid osteotomy (Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Bone cuts for the vertical subsigmoid
        osteotomy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>VSS can be approached either extra- or intraorally. However,
    for intraoral VSS specialised equipment is required, although
    this is not unusual in most centres in the developed world.
    The procedure involves making a vertical cut from the sigmoid
    notch to the angle of the mandible/antigonial notch. In essence,
    a large condylotomy is performed to allow the mandible to
    be set back. The main indication for VSS is for mandibular
    setback when the movements are small. It can be a good alternative
    to the BSSO (see above). Larger movements may require coronoidectomies
    (further bone cuts to remove the coronoid process of the
    ramus of the mandible). VSS can be used to correct asymmetries
    where the mandible is set back on both sides. It cannot be
    used for mandibular advancements unless <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">bone grafting</a>    is also used.</p>
<p>VSS has several advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>rapid and easy procedure;</li>
    <li>excellent for small setbacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>without the specialist equipment for intraoral rigid fixation
        (right-angle drills and screwdriver), intermaxillary
        fixation is required for about six weeks;</li>
    <li>difficult to control condylar position;</li>
    <li>extraoral approach (which does allow fixation) will leave
        visible scars;</li>
    <li>bony union may take longer to achieve;</li>
    <li>in correcting asymmetries, if one fragment needs advancement
        when it was anticipated it would require a setback, VSS
        has no flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inverted-L osteotomy</strong> is a relatively rare operation
    in most practices (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Bone cuts for the inverted-L osteotomy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Inverted-L osteotomy is very similar to VSS in its approaches,
    indications, contraindications, advantages and disadvantages.
    It is said that ramus elongation or advancement can occur
    if the inverted-L osteotomy is used in conjunction with a
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">bone graft</a>.
    Occasionally rigid fixation is possible.</p>
<p>There are several general and specific <strong>complications of ramus surgery</strong>.</p>
<p>General complications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>bleeding;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>;</li>
    <li>non-union or delayed union;</li>
    <li>malunion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific complications:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">nerve damage</a>;</li>
    <li>unfavourable splitting;</li>
    <li>condylar distraction (condylar sag);</li>
    <li>relapse, both early and late;</li>
    <li>temporomandibular joint (TMJ; jaw joint) dysfunction, oedema,
        haemarthrosis;</li>
    <li>tooth extrusion;</li>
    <li><a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal problems</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mandibular segmental procedures</h2>
<p>These operations are designed to alter dentoalveolar segments.
    The indications for these operations are probably reducing
    as orthodontic treatment can manage most problems.</p>
<p><strong>Anterior subapical osteotomy (Köle procedure)</strong>    is performed anterior to the mental foramina, usually from
    canine to canine (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Bone cuts for the Köle subapical
        osteotomy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Vertical osteotomies are placed interdentally and are joined
    by a horizontal cut below the apices of the teeth. An obvious
    prerequisite is space between teeth to allow instrumentation
    without damage.</p>
<p><strong>Posterior subapical osteotomy</strong> and <strong>total subapical osteotomy</strong>    are very difficult procedures with very few indications.
    The <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">inferior alveolar nerve</a>    and vessels are at great risk, along with the tenuous blood
    supply and risk to the tooth root apices. These procedures
    have little to recommend them.</p>
<p><strong>Genioplasty</strong> procedures are used to move the
    chin. The chin can be moved forwards, backwards, rotated,
    reduced or increased in height (Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Bone cuts for genioplasty.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Genioplasty can be performed with a mandibular procedure or secondarily.
    These operations are not without risks (such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">mental nerve damage</a>),
    which must be born in mind especially when genioplasty is
    combined with BSSO (see above). If combined with a sagittal
    split osteotomy, the genioplasty is performed after the BSSO.
    It is easier if intermaxillary fixation is maintained while
    the genioplasty is carried out.</p>
<p>Alloplastic augmentation (with a range of bone filer materials)
    is advocated because of its simplicity and lesser degree
    of postoperative pain, oedema and ecchymoses (bruising) which
    leads to a faster recovery. Occasionally, patients who present
    for aesthetic chin surgery do not have a severe dentofacial
    deformity and have class I occlusion and retrogenia (receding
    chin). These patients desire an increase in chin projection,
    which can be accomplished with an alloplastic implant or
    a sliding osseous genioplasty. Implants are suited for small
    advancements on the order of 4 to 5 mm, usually as part of
    a <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">face-lift procedure</a>.
    The sliding osseous genioplasty can be used for shorter as
    well as longer advancements and it is especially suited for
    vertical height alterations. The implants are susceptible
    to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>, more
    so than the hardware used in osseous genioplasty. Migration
    and deep bony erosion are complications unique to these implants.
    Erosion can be limited by placing the implant low over the
    thicker cortex of the inferior mandible, having at least
    9 cm of surface area of the base of the implant to disperse
    pressure, and by placing at a minimum the central position
    of the implant superficial to the periosteum.</p>
<h1 id="maxillary-procedures">Maxillary Procedures</h1>
<p>Maxillary deformities will occur in anteroposterior, transverse,
    and vertical planes. The maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy is
    a versatile procedure which can address all these problems.
    Thus, once mobilised, the maxilla can be repositioned in
    any plane. The stability of these moves is variably predictable.</p>
<p>The maxilla can also be segmented allowing levelling, narrowing
    or widening of the upper arch. The approach is via a horseshoe
    buccal vestibular incision. Preservation of the palatine
    vessels is thought by some surgeons to be essential, but
    many operators ligate these vessels or us <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">diathermy</a>    if required, with no apparent compromise to the vascularity
    of the maxilla.</p>
<p>The bony cuts for <strong>Le Fort I osteotomy</strong> are a
    straight line starting a few millimetres above the floor
    of the pyriform aperture continuing backwards just above
    the tooth root apices to the zygomatic buttress and back
    to where they contact the pterygoid plates (Figure 6).  </p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-jaw-disproportion-level3-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Skull showing the approximate
        level of bony cuts for Le Fort I osteotomy. Top: lateral
        (side) view; bottom: anterior (front) view.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This Le Fort I design tends to slope downwards from front to
    back; thus in moving the maxilla forward, it will tend to
    move upward as well. Similar cuts are made along the lateral
    nasal walls (medial wall of maxillary sinus), and the nasal
    septum is freed from the nasal surface of the palate (nasal
    floor). Pterygoid disjunction is finally performed before
    down fracture of the maxilla. Variations to these cuts are
    described, but they are essentially variations on a theme.
    Some operators step the lateral cuts in the buttress region
    with a vertical cut (5 to 10 mm in length), with the horizontal
    cut then continuing backward to the pterygoid region. This
    is done in an attempt to prevent the unwanted upward movement.
    The step also gives a vertical reference point in forward
    repositioning. The heights of the bony cuts are only limited
    by the position of the infraorbital nerve. If this is carefully
    preserved, then even the infraorbital rims can be advanced
    (Kufner’s modification).</p>
<p>Another variation is the horseshoe osteotomy, which can be done
    as part of a standard Le Fort I procedure or as a definitive
    osteotomy. It is indicated in superior movements, especially
    when attempting to gain a large impaction.</p>
<p>With the advent of modern orthodontic techniques, segmental surgery
    is seldom indicated.</p>
<p>There are several general and specific <strong>complications of maxillary orthognathic surgery</strong>.</p>
<p>General complications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>bleeding; this can be a major problem in maxillary surgery;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>;</li>
    <li>non-union.</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific complications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>relapse, more likely to occur with downward movements;</li>
    <li>maxillary settling due to inadequate stabilisation, it is
        a posterior or vertical movement;</li>
    <li>condylar distraction (sometimes called condylar sag);</li>
    <li>nerve injury, nearly always temporary and affecting the infraorbital
        nerves;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">avascular necrosis</a>        - an unmitigated disaster!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Segmental procedures</strong> are employed when one or
    more teeth plus, of course, the supporting alveolus need
    to be moved and orthodontic correction cannot (for whatever
    reason) be achieved. Tunnelled approaches via limited incisions
    to preserve blood supply to the tooth/bone segments are used.
    This technique makes visualisation and fixation difficult.</p>
<p>The Wassmund-Wunderer procedure allows movement of the upper
    anterior teeth <i>en bloc</i>. This can reduce an increased
    overjet, close a small anterior open bite and increase or
    decrease incisor show. Schuchardt described a posterior segmental
    osteotomy based on similar principles.</p>
<p>The maxilla can be segmented as part of a Le Fort I osteotomy.
    The posterior segments can be similarly mobilised as described
    by Schuchardt.</p>
<p><strong>Surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE)</strong>    is a useful adjunct to either orthognathic surgery or orthodontics
    alone for maxillary expansion. If the maxilla is significantly
    hypoplastic in a lateral dimension, it is not possible to
    expand it orthodontically in order to correct a buccal crossbite.
    In nongrowing persons, one option is SARPE<strong>.</strong>    This involves making osteotomy cuts (but not fracture and
    mobilisation) to allow orthodontic expansion by a fixed rapid
    maxillary expansion (RME) appliance. The extent of the bone
    cuts varies but should involve the lateral wall of the maxilla
    and often a mid-palatal split. Separation of the pterygoid
    plates may sometimes be performed. The fixed RME is expanded
    at a rate of 0.25 mm twice per day.</p>
<p>Some <strong>soft tissue procedures</strong> are a common part
    of orthognathic surgical approaches. These include</p>
<ul>
    <li>alar base cinch suture (to control the alar base width, which
        nearly always increases);</li>
    <li>V-Y closure (to reduce lip shortening);</li>
    <li>inferior turbinectomy (reduction of these structures will
        allow impaction of the maxilla and may prevent postoperative
        nasal obstruction).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="relapse">Relapse</h1>
<p>Relapse can be defined as movement of osteotomised fragments
    back to their original positions. There are many factors
    that are associated with post-treatment relapse, many of
    which can be anticipated in advance. Good planning and an
    experienced team can minimise problems and take steps to
    avoid or limit relapse.</p>
<p>The University of North Carolina has followed up almost 1500
    patients who had received surgical repositioning of the jaws
    for a minimum of 1 year after surgery, with over 500 of these
    patients reviewed for at least 5 years. This identified highly
    stable, stable, and problematic procedures.</p>
<p>Highly stable procedures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>maxilla upward;</li>
    <li>mandibular advancement;</li>
    <li>genioplasty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stable procedures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>maxillary advancement;</li>
    <li>two-jaw surgery for the correction of class II (maxilla up,
        mandible forward) class III (maxilla forward, mandible
        set back) conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problematic procedures:</p>
<ul>
    <li>isolated mandibular setback;</li>
    <li>maxilla downward;</li>
    <li>widening of the maxilla.</li>
</ul>
<p>For ease of discussion the factors involved can be broadly classified
    as surgical, orthodontic and patient-related factors.</p>
<h2>Surgical factors</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Size of movement.  Movement of the mandible greater than
        8 to10 mm, or maxilla 6 mm forwards.</li>
    <li>Direction of the movement. The most stable movements are
        an advancement smaller than 6 mm in the mandible and
        impaction in the maxilla. The least stable movement in
        the mandible is thought to be a setback, and the least
        stable movement in the maxilla is either a maxillary
        setdown or expansion.</li>
    <li>Inadequate fixation.</li>
    <li>Distraction of the condylar heads out of the glenoid fossa;
        this leads to immediate relapse. It should be corrected
        immediately unless of course the patient is placed into
        intermaxillary fixation postoperatively, in which case
        it will be recognised when the fixation is released,
        which may be too late!</li>
    <li>Poor planning.</li>
    <li>Movements which put the muscle attached to the fragments
        under tension. This can occur in large movements, and
        relapse will tend to occur gradually.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Orthodontic factors</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Extrusion of teeth.</li>
    <li>Soft tissue forces such as endogenous tongue thrust, which
        leads to recurrence of an anterior open bite.</li>
    <li>Tooth movement into a zone of muscle imbalance, which leads
        to relapse on removal of the appliances.</li>
    <li>Poor planning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Patient-related factors</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Poor compliance.</li>
    <li>Anterior open bite due to soft tissue factors such as endogenous
        tongue thrust.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">Cleft lip and palate</a>.
        It is often difficult to advance the maxilla more than
        6 mm without using distraction techniques because of
        dense scar tissue from multiple surgical procedures,
        and relapse often occurs.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="surgery-for-obstructive-sleep-apnoea-osa">Surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)</h1>
<p>Sleep-disordered breathing is increasingly recognized as a potential
    cause of medical morbidity, with obstructive sleep apnoea
    (OSA) the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing.
    It is now appreciated that OSA occurs in a significant number
    of people, beyond the stereotypical Pickwickian syndrome
    (obese) person.</p>
<p>In simple terms OSA results in episodes of hypoapnoea/apnoea
    during sleep resulting from loss of muscle tone of the tongue
    and pharyngeal musculature which leads to airway obstruction.
    Oxygen desaturation occurs as a result of this obstruction,
    and the resulting hypoxia stimulates breathing to correct
    the hypoxia (at the price of disrupting sleep). This cycle
    can be repeated literally hundreds of time a night in severe
    cases and can give rise to symptoms of excessive daytime
    sleepiness, which can lead to poor concentration and impaired
    performance. The cycles of hypoxia can have an adverse effect
    on many physiological functions and may contribute to the
    development of cardiovascular problems such as hypertension.
    The severity of sleep apnoea is classified by the numbers
    of aponeas and/or hypoapnoeas occurring per hour.</p>
<p>Hypoapnoea: a transient reduction (but not complete cessation)
    of breathing for more than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Apnoea: complete cessation of breathing for more than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>The apnoea hypoapnoea index (AHI) indicates the number of apnoea
    and hypopnoea episodes per hour of sleep.</p>
<p>These are measured in a controlled manner during a sleep study,
    known as polysomnography. This study also looks at the lowest
    oxygen saturation during hypoapnoeic/apnoeic episodes and
    limb movements. The results are interpreted by a sleep medicine
    specialist.</p>
<p>Accepted criteria for severity of OSA based on AHI, calculated
    during polysomnography are:</p>
<p>mild: AHI 5 to 14</p>
<p>moderate: AHI 15 to 29</p>
<p>severe: AHI 30 or greater.</p>
<p>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered survey
    with which patients score their likelihood of dozing off
    during a number of daytime scenarios. It is used to assess
    the impact of sleepiness (which may be secondary to OSA)
    on daily life.</p>
<p>It is worth remembering that although many healthcare funders
    (including the UK NHS) exclude ‘simple snoring’ from treatment,
    even snoring without apnoeic events has a disruptive and
    potentially destructive effect on many relationships and
    sleeping arrangements. There is a demonstrated relationship
    with ESS and measures of relationship harmony.</p>
<p>Management of diagnosed OSA can be divided into medical and surgical
    management.</p>
<p>The mainstay of medical management is continuous positive airway
    pressure (CPAP). This involves the patient wearing a special
    face mask during sleep through which air is provided at an
    adjustable pressure. This provides a ‘pneumatic splint’ which
    overcomes the pharyngeal soft tissue collapse and keeps the
    airway patent. It is considered the standard against which
    other treatments for OSA are measured but is often poorly
    tolerated.</p>
<p>In cases of mild to moderate OSA a mandibular positioning appliance
    can be made by a dentist to position the mandible forward.
    This has the effect of bringing the tongue muscle insertions
    forward and helps increase the resting muscle tone, helping
    to relieve the obstruction.</p>
<p>Surgical management of OSA seeks to relieve obstructions at the
    level of the obstruction. The sites of obstruction can be
    nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal. Accurate
    determination of the site of obstruction may be challenging.
    Nasopharyngoscopy is typically used to look for the site
    of obstruction but is not fully diagnostic. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">Lateral cephalograms</a>    are also commonly used, but they provide a two-dimensional
    image of  what is a four-dimensional situation.</p>
<p>Surgical management of OSA may be directed at soft tissue or
    the facial skeleton. Surgery on the facial skeleton is based
    on the techniques of orthognathic surgery. The term telegnathic
    (‘move the jaws a long way’) surgery has been used to describe
    the skeletal surgery for OSA. The common procedures used
    are genioplasty (genioglossal advancement) which is typically
    done in conjunction with another hard or soft tissue procedure,
    and maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) which is basically
    a bimaxillary advancement osteotomy, with or without genioplasty.
    MMA has been demonstrated to provide enlargement of the retrolingual
    airway and some advancement of the retropalatal airway. As
    such it has the capacity to relieve obstructions at multiple
    levels. The surgery may be done without presurgical orthodontics
    in many cases, although in some cases orthodontic setup may
    allow for a greater skeletal movement (the typical goal is
    to get 10 mm or more of mandibular advancement). There is
    a mounting body of evidence that MMA is effective and stable.
    It is increasingly being used as a first line treatment for
    management of OSA in patients who are unable/unwilling to
    use CPAP.</p>
