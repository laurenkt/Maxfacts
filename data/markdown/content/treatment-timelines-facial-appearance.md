<p>If everything heals as normal one would expect
    approximately the following timelines. Please keep in
    mind individual variation can be substantial and each
    operation in this field can be very personalised.
    Dissatisfaction with the result may apply to essentially
    all facial aesthetic procedures.</p>
<h2>Rhytidectomy</h2>
<p>Substantial swelling settles within a few days but
    bruising can be obvious for up to two weeks, although
    make-up can conceal the worst of this. As with all
    aesthetic procedures, skin sutures are minimised but
    when used are removed within six days to minimise the
    risk of punctate scars. Mild altered sensation is not
    unusual and may last for up to six weeks. Weakness of
    the muscles of facial expression is not usual although
    they may occur in so-called ‘deep facelifts’.</p>
<h2>Blepharoplasty</h2>
<p>A ‘pull through’ suture or other technique to avoid
    punctate scarring is common. The main issue is swelling
    and bruising. All noticeable swelling will have resolved
    within ten days and often sooner. Bruising takes up to
    two weeks to completely vanish. Abnormalities of
    sensation once sutures are removed are not common.</p>
<h2>Brow lifts</h2>
<p>Very dependent on the technique used. An old school
    coronal incision brow lift can take up to two weeks for
    swelling and quite dramatic bruising to settle.
    Minimally invasive techniques may have very little
    bruising or discomfort.</p>
<h2>Otoplasty</h2>
<p>Although technique dependent, most surgeons use some form
    of support to the re-sculpting of the cartilage. This is
    one of the most frustrating aspects for children who
    undergo this procedure. A turban like bandage is often
    used which stays in place as long as possible (the aim
    is ten days but it rarely, if ever lasts that long). An
    alternative for both children and adults are ear muffs
    or even headphones which achieve a similar degree of
    support without being overly conspicuous.</p>
<h2>Rhinoplasty</h2>
<p>An extensive range of splints which mostly decorate the
    skin surface of what is actually a bony and
    cartilaginous operation are in use. Most stay on between
    between a week and ten days. Almost all the sutures used
    are resorbable and intranasal. External sutures for open
    rhinoplasty are usually simple paper adhesive strips.
    The most unpleasant aspect is the nasal pack which is
    usually removed the day after the operation.</p>
<h2>Genioplasty</h2>
<p>A simple stretchy elastic pressure dressing is often used
    to reduce swelling. This stays on as long as possible
    but with washing the face this is often only a few days.
    Localised swelling and bruising takes the customary
    seven to ten days to resolve. Altered sensation in the
    region of the lower lip should be minimal to
    non-existent after this time. If combined with an <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion/detailed">orthognathic
        surgery procedure</a>, the swelling bruising and
    elastic guidance of that operation makes the genioplasty
    issues barely noticeable.</p>

    out on non-smokers or smoking should be given up before
    surgery.</p>
