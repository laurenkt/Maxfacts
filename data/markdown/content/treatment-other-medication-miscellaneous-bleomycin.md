<p>The bleomycin group of closely related organic compounds are
    natural products, produced by a bacterium, <i>streptomyces verticillus</i>,
    but have also been synthesized in the laboratory (Figure
    1).</p>

<p>Bleomycin was originally intended as an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial agent</a>,
    in line with the common traits of many bacterial strands
    in producing naturally occurring antibacterial agents as
    a defence of their own bacterial communities against competing
    bacterial strands. The considerable toxicity of bleomycin
    has prevented its application as an antibacterial agent.
    Systemic use of bleomycin is associated with a significant
    burden of pulmonary toxicity, leading to pulmonary fibrosis
    (scarring) and reduced lung function.</p>
<p>Instead, bleomycin has found some role in the <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    of some malignancies, in particular <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy/more-info">Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma</a>    where it is used as a component in multi-agent chemotherapies,
    combined with several other cytotoxic agents. In the 1980s
    and 1990s bleomycin was also used in combination chemotherapies
    of head and neck malignancies, mostly in combination with
    <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles/more-info">cisplatin</a>    and in the palliation of advanced disease, with limited success.</p>
<p>Another, non-systemic, application of bleomycin is in the treatment
    of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities">vascular malformations</a>.
    For non-systemic use of bleomycin, such as intralesional
    injection as a sclerosing agent in the treatment of vascular
    malformations, no pulmonary toxicity has been observed in
    the short term but further investigations of long-term effects
    are necessary. Bleomycin has been found to be a safe and
    effective sclerosing agent for the treatment of a range of
    vascular malformations in the head and neck region, with
    fewer local adverse effects reported than for other sclerosing
    agents. More recently, combined treatment schemes comprising
    of bleomycin sclerotherapy and <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">Nd:YAG laser</a>    treatment for venous malformations in the head and neck region
    also have been advocated as safe and effective treatment
    modalities. About 25 years ago, bleomycin was briefly used
    topically on <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia/more-info">oral premalignant lesions</a>    but never became an established treatment modality.</p>
<p>The mechanism(s) by which bleomycin is cytotoxic have been researched
    for many years. There are a number of hypotheses about these
    mechanisms of action. It is generally agreed that bleomycin
    interferes with DNA, causing DNA strands to break. One line
    of thought is that a number of different chemical reactions
    in a cascade of events lead to this effect. This view is
    based on laboratory observations where it was demonstrated
    that the presence of iron ions and oxygen is necessary for
    this cytotoxic effect to occur. The damage to DNA is then
    ultimately caused by the formation of reactive oxygen species
    (radicals; which is very similar to the main cytotoxic effects
    of high-energy radiation in <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>)
    at the end of this cascade of chemical reactions. Another
    line of investigations postulates a direct interaction of
    bleomycin with DNA by binding to specific sites of DNA. In
    this way, the cleavage of DNA molecules is enabled by a direct
    chemical reaction mechanism between DNA and bleomycin. In
    addition, it has been shown that bleomycin enhances the degradation
    of yet another fundamental cellular component, RNA. This
    represents another route to causing cell damage as RNA is
    essential for the normal function of all cellular metabolic
    processes.</p>
