<p>Treatment of postoperative problems affecting the collarbone
    (clavicle) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open reduction and internal fixation (returning the bone
        to correct position and holding it in place with a titanium
        plate after pathological <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fracture</a>        or malunion (improper alignment after fracture) if the
        clavicle has to be divided to access a very low lymph
        node mass or vessels in the neck.</li>
    <li>Excision of symptomatic <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">ischaemic or avascular necrosis</a>        of the sternoclavicular joint after <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">radical neck dissection</a>        and postoperative <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>.
        The joint between the collarbone and the sternum (breastbone)
        disintegrates because of a lack of adequate blood supply.
        The necrotic area is usually simply excised and not reconstructed.
        The need is very rare.</li>
</ul>
