<p>Here we describe both epithelial and nonepithelial cysts affecting
    different areas of the head and neck region. Cysts affecting
    the jaws are common.</p>
<h1 id="epithelial-cysts">Epithelial cysts</h1>
<p>Epithelial cysts of the jaws can be subdivided according to the
    origin of their epithelial lining. This epithelium can either
    originate from the tooth-forming organ (odontogenic) or from
    other sources such as areas of inclusion of epithelium when
    the embryonic processes of the face fuse (non-odontogenic).
    Odontogenic cysts account for the large majority (90%) of
    jaw cysts.</p>
<p>A good medical history can yield a great deal of information
    about the likely nature of the problem. Signs and symptoms
    of the various types of jaw cysts are frequently similar.
    They usually present either as an incidental radiographic
    finding or as a chronic, painless swelling. Pain becomes
    a feature when the cyst becomes infected or is so extensive
    as to cause a pathological fracture, most commonly of the
    mandible.</p>
<p>Common physical signs of jaw cysts include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Swelling (intra- or extra-oral)</li>
    <li>Displaced teeth</li>
    <li>Mobile teeth</li>
    <li>Crepitus (peculiar ‘egg-shell’ crackling or grating feeling
        or sound under the skin)</li>
    <li>Fluctuation</li>
</ul>
<p>Other signs may be more specific to particular cysts.</p>
<p>Many cysts affect other sections of the mouth or the neck.</p>
<h1 id="odontogenic-cysts-jaws"><strong>Odontogenic cysts (jaws)</strong></h1>
<p>There are several different types of odontogenic cysts of the
    jaws:</p>
<p><strong>Radicular cyst</strong> – in a non-vital tooth, this
    cyst appears as a rounded periapical radiolucency in an X-ray
    radiograph, with loss of lamina dura (bone surrounding the
    tooth socket) and a sclerotic margin if it is a long-standing
    lesion. Figure 1 shows an example.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A dental panoramic radiograph
        showing a typical large radicular cyst in the body of
        the mandible and associated with a lower canine and premolar
        teeth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Residual cyst</strong> - a radicular cyst is left behind
    after tooth removal and continues to grow.</p>

        cyst.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Dentigerous cyst</strong> – usually found as an incidental
    finding on radiographs. The cyst envelopes the crown of a
    tooth. Lower third molars (wisdom teeth) are most frequently
    affected, followed by upper canines and lower premolars.</p>
<p><strong>Eruption cysts</strong> - these cysts are soft tissue
    analogues of dentigerous cysts and usually overlie unerupted
    teeth. They tend to affect children and involve deciduous
    teeth (milk teeth). They appear as a soft, translucent, bluish
    swelling (see Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info/figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Typical blue appearance of an
        eruption cyst.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Keratocyst / keratoystic odontogenic tumour (KOT)</strong>    – this cyst is thought to replace a missing tooth (may be
    a supernumerary). It is associated with unerupted teeth in
    40% of cases. It appears radiographically as a uni- or multiloculated
    radiolucency with a well-defined sclerotic margin. These
    cysts tend to grow in an antero-posterior direction and therefore
    do not always cause bony expansion.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info/figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Panoramic radiograph of a multilocular
        odontogenic keratocyst.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The lesion formerly known as the odontogenic keratocyst was redesignated
    by the World Health Organisation as the keroatocystic odontogenic
    tumour (KOT) in 2005. This change was based on the aggressive
    nature, histology, and genetics of the lesion. While this
    seems to be of interest to pathologists it makes little difference
    to the clinical management and certainly does not justify
    treating these cysts as ‘malignancy’. My personal bias against
    this change in terminology was confirmed by the WHO changing
    the name back to odontogenic keratocyst in 2017. It’s tempting
    to suggest some people have too much time on their hands.</p>
<p>However, multiple keratocysts are a feature of ‘naevoid basal
    cell carcinoma’ syndrome (Gorlin syndrome – multiple basal
    cell carcinomas, calcified falx cerebri, rib anomalies).
    This syndrome is characterized by new cysts appearing throughout
    the jaws over the lifetime of the patient (as opposed to
    locally recurring after treatment). The cysts do not need
    to be managed particularly radically; indeed as the cysts
    often start at a young age overaggressive surgical treatment
    can be a great disservice to the patient.</p>
<h2>Non-odontogenic cysts (jaws)</h2>
<p>Include nasopalatine (median palate, often between the roots
    of the central incisors - incisive canal), globulomaxillary
    (between maxillary lateral incisor and canine), median (middle
    of the hard palate) and nasolablial (soft tissue of upper
    lip) locations.</p>
<p><strong>Nasopalatine cysts</strong> - palatal swelling with pain
    and salty discharge is commonly associated with tooth displacement
    and loss of vitality. Can be suspected radiographically when
    the incisive canal is greater than 6 mm in diameter.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info/figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Anterior view of a nasopalatine
        cyst.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Nasolabial cysts</strong> - soft tissue swelling which
    obliterates the nasolabial fold.</p>
<p><strong>Dermoid cysts</strong></p>
<p>These are developmental cysts and arise at various lines of fusion
    where exodermal tissue can become submerged in the development
    and fusion of the facial processes. These later secrete sebaceous
    material and appear as cystic swellings which are called
    dermoids.</p>
<p><strong>Oral dermoid cysts</strong> - this developmental cyst
    is found in the midline of the neck, above the mylohyoid
    muscle where it causes swelling in the floor of the mouth.
    If it appears as an intraoral swelling, it can be confused
    with a ranula (see below). Oral dermoid cysts tend to present
    in young adults. There is a male to female ratio of 1:1.</p>
<p>There are three general variants:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The common epidermoid cyst which tends to contain a keratinous
        material (material that normally makes up the surface
        of skin) similar to keratocysts (see above).</li>
    <li>The true dermoid cyst which is lined by squamous epithelium
        and contains skin appendages.</li>
    <li>The very rare keratoid cyst which may contain other external
        derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Angular dermoid cysts</strong> – this is an epidermal
    cyst arising above the lateral canthus of the eye at the
    zygomaticofrontal suture. It presents in childhood and may
    have an intracranial extension. Of all craniofacial dermoid
    cysts, the commonest site of origin is between the outer
    angle of the eye and the hairline.</p>
<p>Dermoid cysts can also occur on the nasal bridge, submentally
    (upper front of neck) without presenting in the mouth and
    very low in the neck, just below the sternoclavicular notch
    (near the collar bone).</p>
<p>There is seldom any need for a specific investigation with dermoid
    cysts. However, if there is any suspicion, particularly of
    an angular dermoid cyst of the lateral border of the eye
    being fixed to the underlying tissues, it should be investigated
    by CT scan as on rare occasions dumb bell phenomena can occur
    where two dermoids, one intracranial and one extracranial
    are connected.</p>
<h2>Mucocele</h2>
<p>Mucoceles are mucous extravasation (leakage) cysts where saliva
    leaks from a traumatised minor salivary duct and pools of
    usually mucinous saliva create a connective tissue capsule.
    They almost always affect the lower lip (see Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info/figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Mucocele of the lower lip (most
        common site).</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Ranula</h2>
<p>Ranulas are mucoceles of the floor of the mouth, usually arising
    from the sublingual salivary gland or the duct of the sublingual
    salivary glands. Plunging ranula cross the mylohyoid muscle
    (below the floor of the mouth) and can appear in the neck.</p>
<h2>Branchial cysts (neck)</h2>
<p>There are two theories of origin of these developmental cysts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The branchial cyst is a remnant of the second branchial arch
        which is a specific cluster of cells present in the foetus
        which go on to become other anatomical structures but
        this fails to explain why most branchial cysts present
        in adolescence or adulthood.</li>
    <li>The branchial cyst is actually an epithelial inclusion within
        cervical lymph nodes. This is supported by the fact that
        branchial cysts have no internal opening and most branchial
        cysts do include lymphoid tissue in their wall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other theories exist based around the embryonic development theory.
    There is no agreement as to which theory is the more favourable
    although in terms of popularity origin from the branchial
    apparatus is probably the leader.</p>
<p>Two thirds of these cysts lie anterior to the anterior border
    of the upper third of the sternomastoid muscle (large muscle
    either side of the neck near the surface), one third will
    lie lower than this. Branchial cysts usually present as a
    persistent swelling although pain can be a feature if the
    cyst is infected. These cysts are more frequent in males
    than females, and on the left than on the right side, approximately
    2% are said to be bilateral.</p>
<p>Branchial cysts should be diagnosed clinically. Specific imaging,
    either by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a> can confirm
    an isolated cyst in a classical position. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">Biopsy</a>    by fine needle aspiration cytology may demonstrate cholesterol
    crystals but is otherwise unhelpful.</p>
<h2>Thyroglossal duct cysts (neck)</h2>
<p>The thyroid gland develops from the tuberculum impar at the junction
    of the posterior and anterior two thirds of the tongue, which
    descends during foetal life to the neck. In some instances
    no migration occurs and the thyroid gland can develop as
    a lingual thyroid. On rare occasions this may be the only
    functioning thyroid, but more commonly the tract of descent
    is the source of pathology, usually in the form of a thyroglossal
    duct cyst (the persisting thyroglossal duct runs from behind
    the thyroid gland, through, around or in front of the hyoid
    bone and ends at the foramen caecum in the tongue). Thyroglossal
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistulae</a> may occur when
    an infected thyroglossal cyst discharges spontaneously onto
    the skin, or when inadequate surgery has been attempted to
    excise a thyroglossal cyst.</p>
<p>Thyroglossal duct cysts most frequently present in young children,
    although the age range is wide. The majority of these cysts
    lie in the midline of the neck (90%). These are mostly painless
    central neck masses which move on swallowing and elevate
    on protruding the tongue (see Figure 7).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info/figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Sinus from a thyroglossal duct
        cyst moving up on tongue elevation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These cysts are usually easy to diagnose on a clinical basis.
    If there is normal function of the thyroid gland (euthyroid
    with a normal <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">thyroid stimulating hormone test</a>),
    no further investigations are needed. An <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound scan</a>    of the neck may be recommended to image the usual position
    of the thyroid.</p>
<h2>Cystic hygroma / lymphangioma (neck)</h2>
<p>Cystic hygroma is the most common form of lymphangioma (a malformation
    of the lymphatic system) and is more common in the neck than
    in the mouth. It presents as a cystic mass which infiltrates
    through tissue plains and will not spontaneously resolve.
    They are divided into macrocystic (usually easily removed)
    and microcystic. There may be problems associated with completely
    resecting the non-malignant mass microcystic version.</p>
<h1 id="nonepithelial-cysts">Nonepithelial cysts</h1>
<p>These pseudo-cysts (because these cavities do not have an epithelial
    lining) are fluid-filled cavities within the bone. They can
    be broadly divided into three types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aneurysmal bone cyst</li>
    <li>Solitary bone cyst</li>
    <li>Stafne’s idiopathic bone cyst / cavity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aneurysmal bone cyst (jaws)</h2>
<p>These are benign bone lesions characterised by blood-filled spaces
    and are most commonly found in the long bones (98.5%). They
    are rare in the facial bones and when they do occur they
    are usually seen in the mandible.</p>
<p>The aetiology is unknown. The lesions can be divided into two
    categories. Primary (70%) aneurysmal bone cysts have no associated
    previous lesions and can be congenital (no history of trauma)
    or traumatic. Secondary (30%) aneurysmal bone cysts have
    a history of previous lesions such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">fibrous dysplasia</a>    or a dentigerous cyst (see above).</p>
<p>Clinically, aneurysmal bone cysts present as a firm painless
    swelling, which expands slowly. Sudden expansion and pain
    is usually indicative of sudden bleeding inside the cyst,
    often following minor trauma. Although the teeth generally
    remain vital, there may be malocclusions (misalignment of
    teeth) or root resorption.</p>
<p>Radiographically, aneurysmal bone cysts form unilocular (consisting
    of a single chamber) or multilocular (consisting of multiple
    chambers) radiolucencies, which can be mistaken for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">ameloblastoma</a>    or keratocysts (see above).</p>
<p>Histologically, multiple blood filled spaces are seen which are
    separated by fibrous septa (walls) with scattered multinucleate
    giant cells.</p>
<h1 id="solitary-bone-cyst-jaws"><strong>Solitary bone cyst (jaws)</strong></h1>
<p>These are often seen in the humerus (upper arm) and femur (upper
    leg). They rarely occur in the head and neck region, and
    when they do they are almost always in the mandible.</p>
<p>The aetiology is unknown but it is thought to be due to a haemodynamic
    (related to blood flow) imbalance within the bone. It has
    been suggested that solitary bone cysts may be associated
    with a history of trauma. However, the link is not strong
    and the history of trauma may range from months to years
    prior to occurrence of the cyst.</p>
<p>Clinically, solitary bone cysts are usually asymptomatic but
    there is occasionally bone expansion and radiographically
    there is an irregular radiolucency with well-defined scalloping
    between the roots of the teeth. Histological examination
    shows a thin layer of loose vascular fibrous tissue but no
    epithelial lining and there is no cyst fluid.</p>
<h2>Stafne’s idiopathic bone cavity (jaws)</h2>
<p>This is thought to be a developmental defect on the lingual aspect
    (facing the tongue) of the mandible that contains a portion
    of normal submandibular salivary gland (or sublingual salivary
    gland when seen in the anterior (front) mandible).</p>
<p>Clinically, these cavities are asymptomatic and are usually discovered
    as incidental findings on radiographs, where they appear
    as a well-circumscribed area in the body of the mandible
    with a sclerotic margin. Their location and lack of symptoms
    is often diagnostic. However, further investigation (such
    as sialography (X-ray investigation of the salivary glands,
    using contrast agent), <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> scans can confirm
    the diagnosis.</p>
