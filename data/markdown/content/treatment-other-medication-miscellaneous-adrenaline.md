<p>Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine in North America, occurs
    naturally as a hormone and acts as a neurotransmitter (Figure
    1). In its synthetic form, it is also used as a medicinal
    drug. Amongst other hormones, adrenaline is synthesised in
    the body by specialised cells in the adrenal glands (two
    glands located on top of the kidneys); its natural precursor
    is the amino acid tyrosine.</p>

<p>Adrenaline (as well as the closely related noradrenaline) is
    produced and released in response to emotional, physical
    or environmental trigger signals. Adrenaline plays an important
    role in the body’s sympathetic nervous system that responds
    rapidly to perceived danger (‘fight or flight response’)
    and stress. In this capacity, the main physiological effects
    of adrenaline include  </p>
<ul>
    <li>rapid release of glucose into the blood (for rapid energy
        provision to the body);</li>
    <li>increase of heart rate and blood pressure;</li>
    <li>relaxation of the smooth musculature in the respiratory tract
        (for rapid provision of enhanced oxygen supply);</li>
    <li>constriction of small peripheral arteries to divert and concentrate
        blood flow to brain, respiratory and cardiac systems;</li>
    <li>in addition, some interactions with the <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/overview">‘reward system’</a>        in the brain may occur (known in the context of the ‘adrenaline
        junkie’, seeking risk and extreme situations and activities
        (extreme forms of physical activity stimulate adrenaline
        release) and/or drugs).</li>
</ul>
<p>These normal physiological properties of adrenaline also explain
    its role and functions as medication. Adrenaline can <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">be administered in different ways</a>,
    including inhalation and injection.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is the first-line choice of medication in the treatment
    of severe allergic reactions (<strong>anaphylaxis</strong>).
    Symptoms of anaphylactic shock are difficulty breathing caused
    by airway constriction, low blood pressure, urticaria (skin
    rashes) and facial swelling (angioedema; may affect other
    parts of the body too, especially hands and feet) and nausea.
    Adrenaline counters these effects by increasing the blood
    pressure (by its action as a <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-vasoconstrictor-and-vasoldilator">vasoconstrictor</a>    and the resulting higher resistance in the peripheral vascular
    system), by improving the stroke volume of the heart, by
    bronchodilation (easing breathing by relaxing the muscles
    of the airway), and by decreasing angioedema. People with
    known severe allergies are advised to carry an emergency
    supply of adrenaline for immediate self-administration (by
    injection) for anaphylaxis. Another role as emergency medication
    of adrenaline is in the treatment of <strong>cardiac arrest</strong>,
    where adrenaline is used as a stimulating agent during resuscitation.
    It is vital to be aware that in cardiac arrest adrenaline
    is administered intravenously – this is the only time it
    is, when given or self-administered for anaphylaxis and similar
    reasons it is given subcutaneously or intramuscularly.</p>
<p><strong>Asthma</strong> is another condition where the bronchodilation
    effects of adrenaline are helpful, especially where other
    treatments are not effective. The usual administration route
    for asthma is by inhalation.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is often included in <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia"><strong>local anaesthetics</strong></a>    because of its vasoconstrictive properties, reducing superficial
    <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">bleeding</a> and
    prolonged anaesthesia. Local anaesthetics without a vasoconstrictor
    are virtually never used in the head and neck region because
    of this long established experiential rationale. Local anaesthetics
    with added adrenaline tend to be avoided in areas such as
    the fingers and toes.</p>
<p>Like any other medicinal drug, adrenaline has adverse effects
    that may make it unsuitable for people with hypertension
    (high blood pressure). Adverse effects include increased
    heart and breathing rates, dilated pupils, dizziness and
    general nervousness, excessive sweating. Repeated and/or
    high dose use of adrenaline can have adverse effects on the
    heart muscle tissue. Adrenaline interferes with the working
    of other neurotransmitters, in particular <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antidepressants">tricyclic antidepressants</a>    and the class of antidepressants known as MAOIs (mono-amino-oxydase
    inhibitors; also used to treat Parkinson’s disease), and
    beta-blockers (a class of drugs used to treat hypertension
    and other cardiovascular conditions).</p>
