<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic scanning technique
    that uses a strong magnetic field (the large tube part of
    the scanner) and series of short bursts of radiofrequency
    electromagnetic waves (Figure 1) to produce <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">three-dimensional tomographic images</a>.</p>

        end).</figcaption>

<p>MRI looks at the behaviour of the tiny magnetic moments present
    in the nuclei of almost all atoms. Clinical MRI specifically
    looks at the behaviour of the nuclear magnetic moments of
    hydrogen atoms: hydrogen atoms are everywhere in our bodies,
    mostly in the form of water but are also present in fat,
    muscles, tendons, bones, nerves, etc., and the hydrogen isotope
    with a magnetic moment, <sup>1</sup>H, has very favourable
    magnetic resonance properties. <sup>1</sup>H is not only
    present everywhere in the body, it is also present in very
    high natural abundance (approximately 99 % of hydrogen atoms
    are this (stable) <sup>1</sup>H isotope), in addition to
    several more general ‘MRI friendly’ properties of <sup>1</sup>H.
    The latter aspects are explained in much more detail on our
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">detailed page about MRI</a>.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-works-in-principle">How it works in principle</h1>
<p>When the body, or parts of it, is placed in the strong magnetic
    field of an MRI scanner (inside the large tube part of the
    scanner), the tiny nuclei of the hydrogen atoms in <sup>1</sup>H
    ‘feel’ the presence of the strong magnetic field and partially
    align with it (think of a strongly magnetic compass needle
    which aligns itself with the earth’s weak magnetic field).
    A short sharp burst of radiofrequency waves (a ‘pulse’) lifts
    this alignment, after the pulse is turned off, the magnetic
    moments start re-aligning with the magnetic field. While
    doing so, they themselves emit weak radiofrequency signals
    which are picked up by antennae located in the scanner. Now,
    that would give us a magnetic resonance signal but it would
    not be possible to read any information about the location
    of different tissues, etc, from the signal because the strong
    magnetic field is very uniform. Something else needs to be
    done to also encode information about location – a little
    bit like creating a giant three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle
    made up of thousands of small parts (voxels; think of your
    TV or digital camera – the two-dimensional images there are
    made up of thousands of small parts (pixels) too) and labelling
    each of the voxels with its respective location. In MRI,
    encoding information about location is achieved by switching
    on/off additional (weaker) magnetic fields, called gradients,
    which essentially label MRI signals with information about
    the location from where the signal stems. The rapid switching
    of these gradients are the loud banging noises during the
    scan. MRI scans typically follow recipes of complicated simultaneous
    series of radiofrequency wave bursts and switching of gradients,
    creating thousands of little pieces of information which
    afterwards are put together in a computer to construct a
    three-dimensional image. These three-dimensional images carry
    very detailed information about structures and locations,
    and can be examined in different views (Figure 2).</p>

        gland (large salivary gland in front of the ear) with
        involvement of the lymph nodes in the neck.</figcaption>

<p>In practice, the area of the body in need of MRI scanning has
    to be placed in the centre of the big magnetic field. In
    addition, some hard plastic cover may have to be placed around
    the part of the body being scanned. This plastic cover carries
    additional radiofrequency wave equipment to enable the creation
    of optimum images.</p>
<p>The radiofrequency waves used in MRI have very low energy (Figure
    1) and thus do not damage body tissues (in contrast, traditional
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-rays</a> or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a>    use high-energy (ionising) radiation). However, caution is
    necessary with MRI scans performed on people with certain,
    older metallic implants in their bodies such as pacemakers,
    cochlear implants, some surgical clips and some artificial
    heart valves. Such older metallic implants may be magnetic
    themselves, or may be seriously disturbed by the strong magnetic
    field of the scanner and/or the scanning process. Modern
    such devices (implanted over approximately the past decade)
    are non-magnetic and are thus ‘MRI safe’. Some tattoo inks
    containing magnetic ions (Fe ions) may have an impact on
    image quality.</p>
<p>Sometimes an injection of contrast medium, usually given in the
    vein in the elbow region or the back of the hand, is necessary.
    The purpose of an <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">MRI contrast agent</a>    is to selectively highlight certain aspects of the scans.
    An MRI contrast agent typically consists of molecules with
    magnetic properties (different from <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">contrast media used in X-ray or CT scans</a>).
    MRI contrast agents are eliminated from the body <i>via</i>    the kidneys, hence drinking plenty of water after the scan
    helps to remove the contrast medium swiftly from the body.
    Usually the function of the kidneys will have been assessed
    by a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood test</a>    ahead of an MRI scan that requires the use of contrast agent.</p>
<p>Typically it takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete an MRI
    scan. The exact duration of a scan depends on the kind of
    tissue, the part of the body being investigated and the required
    image resolution for diagnostics. There are two main reasons
    why it takes quite some time to collect the data for a complete
    MRI scan: i) the tiny magnetic moments of atomic nuclei only
    yield weak signals, and ii) the response of these tiny magnetic
    moments in producing measurable signals is rather slow. It
    often takes seconds for the nuclei to return to equilibrium
    after a pulse and thus being ready for subsequent data production
    in the series of tomographic data acquired – there is a large
    number of data to be collected in order to have a final data
    set with the required spatial resolution of the information.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance research laboratories all over the world search
    for methods to boost and/or accelerate the response of the
    tiny nuclear magnetic moments so that hopefully in the
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">future MRI scans</a> will take considerably less time to
        complete.</p>
<p>An MRI scan is a painless procedure. But it is necessary to be
    able to keep still and lie quite flat during the scan so
    that clear images can be recorded (infants may have to be
    sedated for the recording of an MRI scan). Some people find
    the loud banging noises of the scanner unpleasant but earplugs
    and headphones are on offer to minimise the noise disturbance.
    Some people find confinement in the rather narrow scanner,
    together with additional equipment placed close to the head,
    a little claustrophobic. The best advice really is to relax
    and ignore this environment as best one can – it is not in
    any way dangerous, just not particularly ‘nice’. Recently
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">MRI scanners with open magnets</a>    have become available. These scanners may feel less claustrophobic
    but they deliver lower quality images.</p>
