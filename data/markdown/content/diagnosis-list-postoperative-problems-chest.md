<p>Postoperative problems affecting the chest:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The main reason for postoperative problems with the ‘chest’
        are twofold.</li>
    <li>The chest, if seen as the lungs refers to chest <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>,
        atelectasis (partial or complete collapse of the lung),
        pneumonia are all part of the potential generic postoperative
        problem scenario.</li>
    <li>The chest, if seen as maxillofacial specific refers to the
        chest wall, which is primarily the donor site for flaps
        in <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive maxillofacial surgery</a>.</li>
    <li>Pectoralis major is the main, thick superficial chest muscle.
        For purposes of <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">maxillofacial reconstructive surgery</a>,
        this area is common to harvest chest wall pedicled (where
        the transferred tissue remains partially connected to
        the donor site) flaps where the skin and muscle of the
        chest wall, based on the acromiothoracic blood vessels
        (some small branches of veins and arteries under the
        pectoralis major muscle), are rotated to the head and
        neck. The donor site is usually closed primarily, rarely
        gets infected and heals well. The nipple is often moved
        to the midline. Haematoma (accumulation of clotted blood
        in tissue) can occur underneath the remaining skin of
        the chest wall even though drains are always placed.
        The chest feels tight and this can lead to chest infections.
        The scars can stretch and be unsightly and the female
        breast can be distorted. Some weakness in adduction (moving
        the arm inwards) of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/upper-arm">arm</a>        will be noticed.</li>
    <li>The pectoralis minor muscle is a small triangular muscle
        covered by the pectoralis major muscle. It serves as
        donor site for free flaps used in <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">facial reanimation surgery</a>.
        The donor site defects are minimal and the scar is on
        the side of the chest and doesn’t spread.</li>
</ul>
