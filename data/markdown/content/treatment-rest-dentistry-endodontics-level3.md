<p>The pulp maintains a tooth’s nociceptive (denoting pain from
    stimulation) and sensory function. It may become inflamed
    due to the ingress of microorganisms from <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental caries</a>    , through a crack in the tooth, or due to trauma, orthodontic
    movement or occlusal trauma. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">Inflammation</a>    can also be caused by chemical or mechanical irritation from
    dental treatment.</p>
<p>Root canal treatment aims to remove infected pulp tissue as completely
    as possible from the complex root canal system.</p>
<h1 id="assessment">Assessment</h1>
<p>Assessment should be thorough to ensure an accurate diagnosis
    is reached and should involve the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">history</a>;</li>
    <li>examination (swelling, sinus, mobility, tenderness to percussion,
        caries, restoration, occlusion, periodontal status);</li>
    <li>vitality testing of tooth (cold, heat, electric pulp vitality
        testing (EPT));</li>

<h1 id="risks-and-other-considerations">Risks and other considerations</h1>
<p>The risks of endodontic treatment include, but are not limited
    to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>blockages of the root canal space which cannot be overcome
        with instruments;</li>
    <li>instrument separation/fracture within the canal;</li>
    <li>perforations of the canal;</li>

    <li>postoperative infection requiring further treatment or tooth
        extraction;</li>
    <li>tooth or root fracture which may require an extraction;</li>
    <li>fracture, loosening or chipping of the tooth or existing
        crown;</li>
    <li>change in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">sensation/numbness</a>        which may be permanent;</li>
    <li>adverse reactions to materials, chemicals, medications or

</ul>
<h1 id="aims-of-treatment">Aims of treatment</h1>
<p>Root canal treatment (RCT) requires thorough cleaning and shaping
    of the root canal system and provision of a good coronal
    seal. There are four crucial factors which improve RCT outcome:</p>
<ul>
    <li>absence of a periapical lesion preoperatively;</li>
    <li>apical extent of the root filling 0 to 2 mm from the apex;</li>
    <li>the quality of the root filling;</li>
    <li>post-treatment restorative status.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ideal preparation involves both chemical and mechanical irrigation,
    with a funnel taper shape. The three-dimensional contour
    of the tooth root canal space should be followed and the
    filling material should be well compacted to minimize spaces
    available for bacterial colonisation.</p>
<p>Common errors in root canal treatment are incomplete débridement
    either due to a short working length, inadequate time spent
    irrigating the space, missed canals, perforations, formation
    of ledges or elbows within the canals and apical transportation.</p>
<h1 id="procedure">Procedure</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Diagnosis - imaging should allow for an estimated working
        length to be determined.</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">Anaesthesia</a>        - this can be more challenging to achieve if there is
        infection present due to the acidity of pus. However,
        multiple techniques are available and this should not
        prevent treatment being attempted initially. Aside from
        the routinely used infiltrations and nerve blocks, techniques
        may include intraligamentary injections, intraosseous
        and intrapulpal anaesthesia.</li>
    <li>Tooth preparation - for example caries removal and building
        up the tooth to accommodate a rubber dam; this should
        be done before commencing root canal treatment.</li>
    <li>Rubber dam placement - essential to prevent ingress of oral
        bacteria into the root canal space, to protect the oropharynx
        from instruments, chemicals and debris. Also aids visualisation
        and moisture control when required.</li>
    <li>Access - the tooth should be accessed in a way that conserves
        as much tooth structure as possible whilst allowing good
        visualisation of the pulp spaces. Good lighting and magnification
        are recommended.</li>
    <li>Chemical and mechanical preparation - this can be with hand
        or rotary instruments, chemicals commonly used are sodium
        hypochlorite, NaOCl, and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">chlorhexidine gluconate</a>.
        Copious irrigation is mandatory. Not only does this disinfect
        the canal, it prevents debris blocking the canal system
        and helps to flush away necrotic pulp and bacteria, as
        well as dentine chips. The whole canal system should
        be cleaned and necrotic pulp removed. The canal should
        be shaped to a tapered funnel, respecting the three-dimensional
        anatomy of the canal. X-ray radiographs may be necessary
        as well as the use of an apex locator to ensure the files
        are in the correct place and reaching the apex of the
        tooth. Most clinicians will ‘scout’ the canal first using
        a very fine file to the estimated working length of the
        tooth, before increasing the size of the files used to
        create a ‘glide path’. The coronal two thirds can then
        be flared, allowing for débridement and entry of irritants
        in to the canal system. Finally, the apical third can
        be prepared and the full canal shaped to a funnel taper.</li>
    <li>Obturation - the canal should be sealed with a sealant material
        (for example, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> or eugenol-based) plus
        in most cases gutta percha. This can be packed through
        cold lateral condensation, heated up and soft points
        inserted in to the canal, or a flowable form injected.
        An X-ray radiograph may be useful to check that the gutta
        percha filling is in the correct place both before sealing
        it, and before cutting it back. Excess gutta percha should
        be cut back, sealed (often by a flowable composite or
        resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RM-GIC)) and the
        tooth restored. There are many different options for
        restoration of the tooth following obturation, including
        composite restorations, inlays and crowns.</li>
    <li>A final obturation X-ray radiograph is normally taken to
        assess the final result. However, this is a two-dimensional
        representation of a three-dimensional object and it will
        not be possible to see the entire tooth from all angles.
        The radiographic apex may also appear to be in a different
        location to the actual apex of the tooth.</li>
</ul>
<p>The root filling material should be within 0 to 2 mm of the apex
    of the tooth for the best success rate. Within this distance
    the success rate was found to be 94 % compared with 76% for
    beyond the apex, and 68% if short by &gt;2 mm. If the root
    is underfilled this leaves voids for fluid accumulation and
    bacterial proliferation, apical leakage and proliferation
    of a periodical infection. When overfilled, the material
    can push necrotic debris beyond the apex, causing inflammation
    or a foreign body reaction.</p>
<h1 id="restoration">Restoration</h1>
<p>The coronal seal is a crucial factor in the success of a root
    canal treatment. A good root canal treatment with a good
    coronal seal is the gold standard, however a poorer root
    canal treatment may still succeed if the coronal seal is
    adequate. The coronal seal prevents further ingress of bacteria
    in to the root-treated space and protects the tooth, which
    is often weak and vulnerable to fracture due to being ‘hollowed’
    out in the process of root canal treatment.</p>
<h1 id="success">Success</h1>
<p>According to the European Society of Endodontology (2006), the
    criteria for success when assessed at one year (or four years
    if uncertain outcome) are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>favourable - no sinus / pain / swelling / loss of function,
        and X-ray radiograph shows normal periodontal ligament
        (PDL) space;</li>
    <li>uncertain - residual periapical lesion, remains the same
        or partially resolves;</li>
    <li>unfavourable - infection, periapical lesion formation, existing
        lesion expands, four years without resolution, root resorption.</li>
</ul>
<p>X-ray radiographs should be taken at one year after treatment
    to assess the periodontal ligament space, the periapical
    status and bone levels around a root-canal treated tooth.</p>
