<p>Mouth cancer also called oral cancer, is much commoner world-wide
    than most people think. It is relatively common in the Asian
    subcontinent. It is primarily caused by tobacco use and heavy
    alcohol consumption, a small percentage are caused by Human
    Papilloma Virus (HPV virus).</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know how the HPV virus can cause mouth
        cancer, there is some more information on our <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">detailed mouth cancer</a>        page.</p>
</aside>
<p>Treatment depends on the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">stage</a>    of the disease, any co-existing illnesses you may have, which
    may limit the extent of treatment you can cope with and your
    decision after your case has been discussed with a group
    of experts known in the UK as a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT).
    The stage is worked out by combining the results of <a href="/diagnosis/tests">diagnostics tests</a>    which will be arranged as soon as it is felt you have a cancer.
    Very rarely they may be arranged before <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>    but usually this is after as the biopsy confirms whether
    or not it is a cancer and what type of cancer it is.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment">Treatment</a> may be intended to cure if
    the cancer has a good chance of cure or palliative if there
    is no chance of cure or it is very unlikely you can cope
    with the treatment. You are in charge of this decision but
    there are many people available to help you make it. In the
    best units treating mouth cancer in the UK cures are achieved
    in over 65% of patients and your life in the <a href="/help">aftermath of treatment</a>    will take on increasingly greater significance.</p>
