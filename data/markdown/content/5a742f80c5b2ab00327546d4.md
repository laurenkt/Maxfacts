<p>With acute and/or chronic inflammation being the most noticeable
    sign of the functions and responses of the immune system,
    we take a closer look at the underlying working mechanisms
    of the body’s defence system. The most common way to classify
    the different mechanisms and components at work in the immune
    system is to subdivide it into a fast-response, non-specific
    subsystem (the innate immune system; response within minutes
    or a few hours) and a more sophisticated and specific, slow-response
    subsystem (the adaptive immune system; response within several
    days).</p>
<p>These two categories are not completely separate from each other,
    and both are closely related to the various transport functions
    of the vascular (blood vessels) system, including many aspects
    of blood clotting. The vascular system is involved because
    it is necessary to transport specific molecules and cells
    to the location in the body where infection and/or other
    tissue damage requires an inflammatory response. That is,
    the attempt of the body to eliminate the cause(s) of a problem
    leading to inflammation.</p>
<p>We use the immune response to bacterial infection as our worked
    example (see below). However, we emphasise that <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">other causes (biological, chemical and physical)</a>    lead to similar types and cascades of immune system responses.
    In particular, the role of inflammation in wound healing
    is relevant in the context of maxillofacial surgery (see
    below). Our worked example indirectly also illustrates, broadly,
    the many opportunities for small causes and errors leading
    to big <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">malfunctions in the complicated immune system</a>.</p>
<p>Below we can only provide a rough sketch of how the immune system
    works (if everything functions as it should) but hopefully
    this will also give an impression of how complicated in reality
    this defence system is. Given the importance of the immune
    system, there is <a href="/treatment/other/further-reading">ample literature</a>    about the topic, as well as much ongoing research into it,
    including its failures and options to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">treat malfunctions of the immune system</a>.
    The organisation of the human immune system even inspired
    the construction of intelligent, rule-based machine-learning
    computer algorithms (alongside many other biologically inspired
    algorithms).</p>
<h1 id="the-innate-immune-system">The innate immune system</h1>
<p>Invading pathogens (bacteria, fungi and viruses) typically carry
    some surface molecules (sugars and proteins) as part of the
    normal make-up of their surface structure. The precise nature
    of these surface molecules varies slightly between pathogens
    but there are common patterns and types of surface molecules
    (peptidoglycan is an example from the make-up of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">bacterial cell walls</a>).
    The innate immune system is organised such that it can rapidly
    identify the presence of such typical surface molecules.</p>
<p>This makes the innate immune system a general, non-specific rapid
    response defence against all kinds of invading microorganisms
    (see Figure 1). The innate immune response makes use of the
    presence of these common surface molecules by acting as a
    general sensor, which triggers the mechanisms by which the
    destruction of the invading species is then attempted.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The innate immune response is
        a generalised response against infecting microorganisms.
        Different types of bacteria have some common characteristics
        in their individual composition of surface molecules,
        which are recognised by the innate immune system.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Phagocytes are a type of white blood cells involved in the innate
    immune response (see Figure 2). Phagocytes can recognise
    the surface molecules of pathogens through their own surface
    molecules, called cell surface receptors.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A phagocyte is a specialised type
        of white blood cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Phagocytes can distinguish between pathogenic cells and human
    host cells due to some differences in the molecules present
    on the surface of human cells. On host cells  there are often
    no surface molecules which are complementary (able to fit
    together) to the phagocytic cell surface receptors. Sometimes
    surface molecules present on a pathogen may be only slightly,
    but significantly, different from those on a human host cell.
    This is schematically illustrated in Figure 3. This distinction
    is vital so that host cells (often called self-cells) do
    not stimulate an erroneous immune response, targeting the
    host. Similarly, it is important that under normal circumstances
    an immune response is not triggered by the presence of the
    host’s <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">commensal (friendly) microorganisms</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Pathogens have surface molecules
        which are different to the surface molecules on host
        cells and those of the host’s <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">benign microflora</a>.
        These differences allow for invading pathogens to be
        recognised as foreign or ‘non-self’.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When a phagocyte surface receptor binds to a surface molecule
    of an invading microorganism, the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen
    completely by surrounding it in what can be thought of as
    a bubble (a lysosome; see Figure 4). This process is called
    phagocytosis. Once the pathogen is encapsulated by the lysosome,
    the phagocyte produces toxic chemicals inside the lysosome
    (hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and nitric oxide) in order
    to destroy the pathogen trapped inside. The chemically decomposed
    pathogen debris becomes the major component of pus in infected
    wounds or in an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> A phagocyte engulfs an invading
        bacterium and traps it inside a lysosome. The lysosome
        contains chemicals and enzymes that ultimate break down
        the bacterium.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other receptors on the surface of phagocytes can bind to a range
    of further molecules on the surface of pathogens and generate
    what is known as a signal cascade. A set of biochemical signals
    and reactions, one after another, is triggered which eventually
    leads to the synthesis of particular proteins in the cell.
    Such a cascade is schematically illustrated in Figure 5.
    It is a series of events which involve the DNA contained
    within the nucleus of a cell (shown in purple). These processes
    allow for certain genes to be switched on or off, by the
    means of a protein molecule switch known as a transcription
    factor. If a gene is switched on, the ‘recipe’ for making
    the corresponding protein is made available and so the protein
    can be produced by the cell. A wide range of proteins produced
    by such signal cascades are involved in the immune response.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Binding of bacterial surface molecules
        with the surface receptors on the phagocyte gives rise
        to a biochemical signal cascade which results in the
        production of specific proteins involved in the immune
        response.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Receptors on the phagocyte surface are specialised protein molecules
    which are able to bind to different microbial molecules (from
    bacteria, viruses, fungi) in order to switch on or off gene
    expression, and hence protein production. Binding to these
    receptors leads to production of specific signalling proteins,
    cytokines including chemokines. Such signalling proteins
    are vital messenger and mediator molecules for the swift
    execution of the inflammatory response by the innate immune
    system.</p>
<p>When phagocytes are signalled to produce chemokines through surface
    receptor binding, release of these chemokines from the phagocytes
    leads to a chemokine concentration gradient (see Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Chemokines (pink hexagons) are
        more concentrated close to the phagocyte producing them,
        their concentration decreases with distance from the
        phagocyte. The resulting chemokine concentration gradient
        signals the way for other white blood cells to find quickly
        the infected area.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The human body generally makes use of concentration gradients
    in order to transport and direct a range of materials and
    cells around the body. In an inflammatory response, the chemokine
    concentration gradient attracts other types of white blood
    cells (which can aid the phagocytes in pathogen destruction)
    to the site of infection.</p>
<p>Phagocytes can produce further types of messenger proteins, such
    as cytokines that make it easier for some helpful white blood
    cells to pass from the blood in capillaries (small blood
    vessels) into infected tissue via endothelial cells (cells
    which line the capillaries). This type of cytokine achieves
    this effect by increasing the gaps between endothelial cells
    (vasodilation; see Figure 7 for a schematic illustration).
    The movement of the white blood cells from the capillaries
    into surrounding tissues is termed extravasation.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The release of cytokines from
        the phagocyte makes it easier for some other types of
        white blood cells to pass through the endothelial cell
        layer (shown in pink) in order to reach the tissue site
        of the infection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This overall chain of events explains the well-known signs and
    symptoms of acute inflammation. Vasodilation causes warmth
    and redness (calor and rubor) of the affected area, extravasation
    leads to swelling (oedema), pain (dolor) is caused by some
    of the chemical messenger molecules stimulating nerve endings,
    and some chemical messenger molecules may cause fever.</p>
<h1 id="the-adaptive-immune-system">The adaptive immune system</h1>
<p>The adaptive immune system does not focus on the broad and rapid
    identification of the presence of pathogens in general, but
    rather it is able to recognise (and remember) a very large
    number of molecules, representative of a particular pathogen.
    This specific recognition is biochemically processed in order
    to produce an immune response specific to the particular
    pathogen. It is important that the adaptive immune response
    is as efficient as possible, it is the last line of defence
    available to the body against <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">infection</a>.
    Figure 8 symbolises the specific actions of the adaptive
    immune system (compare Figure 1, symbolising the general
    actions of the innate immune system).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> The adaptive immune system response
        sketched here is targeted specifically at the bright
        green type of bacterium. In principle, the adaptive immune
        system would be able to respond to infection by the remaining
        bacteria species as well (shown here to have a central
        colour of pink, blue or turquoise) but each species would
        require the development of its own individual cascade
        of adaptive immune system response. This takes time.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The white blood cells of the adaptive immune system are able
    to engulf an infecting pathogen, and then identify the various
    components and molecules which make up this particular microorganism,
    before they finally present a small protein (an antigen)
    with a specific shape on their cell surface. In effect, the
    antigen on the surface of the white blood cell represents,
    like a fingerprint, the particular pathogen. This type of
    white blood cell is often referred to as an antigen-presenting
    cell (see Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure9.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> A white blood cell of the adaptive
        immune system engulfs a bacterium and processes its components
        to form an antigen with a characteristic shape on the
        white blood cell surface.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The shape of the antigen on the surface of the white blood cell
    is complementary (fits exactly) to the shape of the receptor
    on another type of adaptive immune system defence white blood
    cell, called a T cell. Binding of the T cell receptor with
    the antigen signals two separate strands of immune system
    response (see Figure 11, below).</p>
<p>The first of these responses is called a humoral response. A
    humoral response is an immune system activity involving extracellular
    fluids (body fluids) and complements the intracellular immune
    responses. B cells (another subtype of white blood cells)
    produce specific molecules, called antibodies. These are
    proteins which are very specifically matched to the shape
    of the corresponding antigen. Antibodies have constant regions
    which are very similar in all antibodies and variable regions
    which are different for different antibodies and allow specific
    binding to ‘their’ matched antigens (see Figure 10). This
    mechanism is often referred to as antibody-mediated immune
    response.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> The constant and variable regions
        of an antibody. The constant region is very similar in
        all antibodies. The variable region has a highly specific
        shape, complementary for its respective antigen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Antibodies have various functions, all reliant upon complementary
    binding of the corresponding antigen. In this way, antibodies
    are able to block toxins produced by pathogens from binding
    to healthy host cells and thus can prevent damage to healthy
    tissues. Antibodies are also able to form complexes with
    surface proteins of viruses such that a virus is unable to
    attach to the host cells and so cannot infect them (this
    principle is also the mechanism underpinning vaccinations).
    In similar ways, antibodies can bind to bacterial surface
    antigens and can prevent bacteria from forming colonies,
    which makes them individually more vulnerable to destruction
    and elimination, either by the immune system or by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial agents</a>.</p>
<p>The second of the two strands of adaptive immune system response
    is mediated by T cells (subtype of white blood cells, also
    active in the innate immune system). It is a cellular response
    in which the binding of the antigen with the T cell receptor
    results in the production of specialised killer cells. These
    specialised cells are capable of destroying the invading
    pathogen. They do so by causing holes in the cell membranes
    of the microorganisms, leading to leakage from the pathogen
    cells and eventual cell death.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-inflammation-level2-figure11.png">

<h1 id="inflammation-and-wound-healing">Inflammation and wound healing</h1>
<p>Any injury to tissue, from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a>    or following <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a> triggers
    an immediate reaction to limit the damage, followed by an
    orderly and lengthy process of healing. Inflammatory response
    plays a crucial role in the healing of wounds.</p>
<p>The initial phase immediately after an injury occurs is haemostasis,
    the attempt to stop blood loss, by way of constriction of
    injured blood vessels and platelets starting the formation
    of a sticky fibrin-rich clot. This emergency response occurs
    immediately, over a few minutes. In addition, platelets release
    messenger molecules that trigger the start of a rapid inflammatory
    response. At this stage, vasodilation sets in to ease delivery
    of helpful cells to the injured tissue site, over a period
    of about an hour.</p>
<p>Essentially, this very first step toward wound healing involves
    the build-up of gradients of specific proteins (chemokines
    and cytokines, see Figure 6; above) that guide immune cells
    and phagocytes to the site of injury. This phase is the body’s
    attempt at cleaning a wound before proceeding further with
    repairing the injured tissue. This stage of acute inflammation
    lasts for a few days, various mechanisms of inflammatory
    response orchestrate and guide the process.</p>
<p>The inflammatory response remains active for a couple of weeks,
    in changing and adapting roles in the progressing healing
    process. Inflammation is gradually taken over by a phase
    called proliferation. The initial fast response turns to
    repair of the tissue damage, still initiated by inflammatory
    mediators. It is important (from an evolutionary point of
    view) that initial repair re-establishes functionality to
    the body after injury relatively quickly. Nature has opted
    for a staged, two-stage approach to this challenge.</p>
<p>In the proliferation phase, over a period of several weeks to
    several months, the inflammatory response directs the growth
    of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) in the injured area.
    These new blood vessels are needed to transport fibroblasts
    (cells that produce connective tissue such as collagen and
    other structural materials in tissue) and macrophages (a
    specialised type of phagocyte, white blood cell) to the location
    in need of repair, and to remove debris (diseased tissue,
    spent repair materials) away from the site. A typically very
    visible sign of the body’s wound repair at work over this
    phase is the reddening of the wound, caused by angiogenesis
    (ingrowth of new blood vessels) and leading to an intermediate
    period in the healing process where a wound looks raw and
    seemingly as if it is getting worse rather than better. Over
    this phase mostly granulation tissue is formed, new connective
    tissue with numerous microscopic blood vessels. Granulation
    tissue grows from the inside of a wound and eventually fills
    the entire damaged space while some contraction of the damaged
    site occurs as well. This initial repair stage delivers a
    degree of functionality and wound closure, about 50 percent,
    or so, of the original tissue strength and removes the urgency
    of the body response.</p>
<p>Gradually, the proliferation phase then moves on to the last
    phase of the wound healing, the maturation and remodelling
    phase. This final stage takes up to two years for completion
    and is essentially an optimisation of the initial repair
    results from the proliferation phase. It makes sense that
    this last optimisation phase is slow: at this stage the focus
    is moving to an optimal long-term result, and that is best
    delivered in a slow and non-chaotic process of replacing
    the initially deposited ‘quick fix’ connective tissue material
    by better quality connective tissue (there are different
    types of collagen, for example). The inflammatory response
    is now much reduced, the structure and strength of the local
    tissue is gradually improved. A body is a highly efficient
    system, nothing goes to waste and nothing unnecessary will
    be preserved. Accordingly, over the maturation process the
    multitude of local new blood vessels around a site of injury
    and scar are gradually reduced, in line with the reduced
    need for transport to / from the injury location. The visible
    sign of this process is the corresponding gradual change
    in colour of a maturing scar, which over time turns pale
    and becomes much less visible.</p>
<p>A typical result of wound remodelling delivers roughly 80 percent
    of the original tissue strength. The ‘auto-repair’ process
    of wound healing is thus a slightly incomplete and imperfect
    type of tissue regeneration when, for example, compared with
    the normal renewal processes of intact skin where the regeneration
    is complete and perfect.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that scars resulting from the wound healing
    process are the price for the swift on-set of the healing
    process after injury. There are some noticeable exceptions
    where no scars are formed in the healing process, for example
    superficial scratches, tattoos, or the healing of skin wounds
    in a foetus. Also, some tissues heal with reduced levels
    of scarring, for example the oral mucosa (lining of the mouth).
    Oddly, the latter two examples have in common a substantially
    reduced inflammatory response early in the healing process.
    These differences in wound healing mechanisms are the subject
    of much <a href="/treatment/other/further-reading">ongoing research</a>    with a view to improve care and outcomes for problematic
    wounds.</p>
<p>A number of problems in the wound healing process can occur for
    people with underlying conditions that modify or impair the
    immune response.</p>
<p>Lack of formation of scar tissue leads to rupture of wounds (dehiscence).
    Another well know example of problematic wound healing is
    the development of chronic non-healing wounds in people with
    diabetes where an aberrant immune response prevents, or at
    least considerably reduces, wound healing. Such chronic wounds
    and ulcers not only increase the risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a> but
    typically also have negative effects on quality of life.</p>
<p>An example of malfunctioning wound healing, likely to result
    from an overactive inflammatory response to injury, is the
    formation of keloids. Keloids are essentially excessive scar
    tissue, continuously formed beyond the original area of injury.
    Keloids mostly affect dark-skinned people. Hypertrophic scarring
    is another form of excess formation of scar tissue but is
    localised to the original area of injury. Aberrant orchestration
    of healing events in the proliferation phase may lead to
    excessive formation of granulation tissue. An example of
    the effects of timing errors in the early inflammatory response
    is the occurrence of a painful <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info">‘dry socket’</a>    after dental extractions when the initial protecting clot
    is resolved too rapidly. Combinations of slight orchestration
    misalignments of the healing process with occasional mechanical
    problems may lead to deficient contraction (affecting
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin grafts</a>) or to excessive contraction (a typical long-term
        problem arising from large burns). Another potential
        problem (mostly affecting burn wounds) are changes in
        pigmentation of scar tissue.</p>
