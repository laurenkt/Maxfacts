<p>The head &amp; neck region is densely packed with a variety of
    different nerves with a range of different functions, autonomous
    (not under voluntary control) as well as somatic (under voluntary
    control) nerves.</p>
<p>The term neuropathy refers to damage to, and abnormal function
    or lack of function of any of these nerves and thus covers
    a wide range of symptoms and conditions. The diverse symptoms
    depend on the nerve(s) affected. Usually the term neuropathy
    refers to conditions of peripheral nerves, the nerves other
    than the central nerve system (brain).</p>
<p>Neuropathies can be the consequence of disease or injury, or
    the cause may be unknown (idopathic). Neuropathies can be
    acute or chronic conditions, chronic neuropathies may overlap
    with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">chronic pain</a>    conditions.</p>
