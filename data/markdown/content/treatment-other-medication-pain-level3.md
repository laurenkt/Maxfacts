<p>Across the world, the general number 1 reason to seek medical
    support is pain. In 2019 analgesics are the most widely used
    of all medicinal drugs, worldwide. No wonder that nowadays
    there is a bewildering range of analgesic agents (and other
    approaches to manage pain). Adequate treatment of pain, a
    wider recognition that acute and chronic / neuropathic pain
    are very different circumstances, as well as an increasingly
    more honest attitude toward adverse effects, has been a complicated
    journey over the past decades.</p>
<p>In 1986 the World Health Organisation (WHO) proposed a simple
    scheme (which became known as the WHO analgesic ladder; Table
    1) of escalating pain medication according to need, in order
    to improve the analgesia provision for cancer patients who
    often suffered unnecessarily from severe and undertreated
    pain. It was recognised that some irrational fears had to
    be overcome: fears by clinicians to prescribe opioids, and
    fears by patients to use opioids. The scheme certainly helped
    in that respect, but over the decades it has become outdated
    as more and different analgesics and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">delivery options</a>    were developed. Some refinements and expansions were added
    to the simple original scheme over time.</p>

    of cancer-related pain</h2>

<p>However, it seems sometimes to have been forgotten that the scheme
    in Table 1 was never meant as a guide to treat chronic /
    neuropathic pain conditions. Especially in North America
    this oversight, in combination with powerful (if not dubious)
    marketing methods by the pharmaceutical industry, lead to
    what now has become a full blown epidemic of opioid use,
    with all the concomitant personal and societal adverse effects
    one should expect in that situation. Fortunately, the European
    approaches to pain control seem to have been more thoughtful
    and temperate. However, prescriptions of opioids have also
    increased in Europe over recent years, and there are reasons
    to believe that opioids are increasingly and inappropriately
    prescribed for the management of chronic / neuropathic pain
    conditions. Over the past decade more appropriate schemes
    for the management of chronic / neuropathic pain have been
    developed. And yet, it strikes one as a sad fact, if in 2016
    the <i>British Medical Journal</i> sees a need to publish
    an editorial reminder, in no uncertain terms, about failures
    past and present in the use of analgesic drugs for the management
    of chronic / neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Below we give an overview of analgesics used in the management
    of oral and maxillofacial conditions. Our discussion groups
    analgesics together according to their mechanisms of action.</p>
<h1 id="non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</h1>
<h2>Mechanism</h2>
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are organic chemicals,
    most of them carboxylic acids. NSAIDs have analgesic, antipyretic
    (prevent or reduce fever) and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">anti-inflammatory</a>    effects. They act in different places in different circumstances,
    often depending on the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">mode of delivery of the drug</a>,
    but generally act in the periphery by reducing <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">hyperalgesia</a>.</p>
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs act by inhibiting the family
    of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes by blocking the catalytic
    site or channel of these enzymes (Figure 1). There are two
    closely related COX enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 supports
    the ongoing synthesis of the various <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a>    needed for general, normal cell functions, including maintenance
    and protection of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.
    COX-2 is involved in the synthesis of most of the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">prostaglandins and thromboxanes</a>    contributing to inflammation, nociceptive sensitisation (enhanced
    pain perception] and fever.</p>
<p>Blocking or inhibiting COX enzymes thus inhibits the production
    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">prostaglandins and thromboxanes</a>,
    which is thought to be the mechanism leading to the dominant
    analgesic effect of NSAIDs. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
    drugs inhibit both COX enzymes, so also inhibit processes
    needed for general, normal cell functions which explains
    their well known and widely experienced adverse effects (see
    below).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes
        (COX) by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs attenuate abnormal pain
    responses in inflammatory conditions, they have no obvious
    effect on normal pain thresholds and only work to overcome
    mild to moderate pain in inflammation.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/aspirin">Aspirin</a>    is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with additional
    functions (suppressing normal platelet functions in blood
    clotting), beyond its analgesic role. Unlike other NSAIDs,
    aspirin has long-lasting inhibitory action on the COX enzymes.</p>
<h2>List of NSAIDs commonly used in maxillofacial surgery</h2>
<p>Figure 2 depicts the chemical molecular structures of five commonly
    used NSAIDs, diclofenac, naproxen, ketorolac, ibuprofen and
    aspirin; all of which are carboxylic acids.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The molecular structures of non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory drugs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Adverse effects and other considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>all NSAIDs carry increased cardiovascular risks (naproxen
        has replaced diclofenac in the UK and US after such concerns;
        more recently similar concerns have been raised over
        long-term use of ibuprofen), increase in blood pressure
        and reduced anti-aggregatory and vasodilation effects,
        increased risk of bleeding (especially gastrointestinal
        (GI) tract, aggravated by accumulation of these acidic
        chemicals in the GI mucosal cells by ion trapping when
        orally administered);</li>
    <li>protection of the GI tract under NSAID treatment by prescribing
        additional  <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antacid">antacid medications</a>        may be advised;</li>
    <li>diclofenac is known to be a cause of common intolerance and
        allergic reactions, causing mainly urticaria (rash and
        swelling) and other skin problems, but anaphylaxis (allergic
        shock) has been reported;</li>
    <li>many NSAIDs are available over the counter but only in low-dose
        preparations; these may be inadequate for pain management
        in some situations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Typical maxillofacial applications of NSAIDs include treatment
    of</h2>
<ul>
    <li>acute bone pain after surgery or after <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">trauma</a>        such as fractures of facial bones (it may be better to
        avoid NSAIDs because there is some evidence that these
        agents may delay wound healing);</li>
    <li>acute <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">orofacial infections</a>;</li>
    <li>in combination with other analgesic agents such as paracetamol
        (see below) or opioids (see below) in the treatment of
        more severe pain (see above, Table 1).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="opioids">Opioids</h1>
<h2>Mechanism</h2>
<p>Opioids all act upon the same group of receptors, known as opioid
    receptors and belonging to a family of G protein-coupled
    receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs are part of a large family of proteins
    that reach across the cell membrane (transmembrane domains)
    and are involved in numerous regulatory processes in health
    and disease. Many different ligands bind to these receptors,
    including <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">naturally occurring opioid-like substances</a>    released in the body (endogenous opioids such as <i>β</i>-endorphins
    and enkephalins) as well as synthetic opioids. Most opioid
    receptors are located in the central nervous system, but
    some are found in the periphery (peripheral opioid receptors).
    The binding of opioids to opioid receptors in the brain causes
    suppression of pain signals by descending pathways (descending
    inhibition). The descending pathways are mechanisms that
    modulate the pain signalling by fibres descending from the
    brain by interfering with the transmission of pain signals
    to the brain. There are inhibitory as well as enhancing mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are three main categories of opioid receptors, mu (<i>µ</i>),
    delta (<i>δ</i>) and kappa (<i>κ</i>). Their structures are
    generally similar, with the binding pocket of each being
    very similar but differing in the structures that make first
    contact with a ligand before it binds. This allows for degrees
    of selectivity for binding of ligands, depending on the ligand
    structures.  </p>
<p>When opioids bind to the receptor(s), the receptors inhibit voltage-dependent
    calcium channels (Figure 3) or activate potassium channels.
    This action stops the pain signal from travelling along the
    neuron and is the main mechanism of analgesia by opioids.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Inhibition of voltage-dependent
        calcium channels by opioids.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The effect of binding depends on whether the receptor is on the
    pre-synaptic or post-synaptic neuron. Binding to opioid receptors
    on the pre-synaptic neuron inhibits voltage-dependent calcium
    channels, so decreasing the release of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">neurotransmitters</a>    such as glutamate, serotonin, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a>    and substance P. Binding to opioid receptors on the post-synaptic
    neuron activates potassium channels, which stop depolarisation,
    inhibiting neuronal firing by decreasing neuronal excitability
    and causing hyperpolarisation of the neuron.</p>
<p>Opioids can also interact with <i>α</i>2-adrenergic receptors
    on pre-synaptic neurons, which are linked to inhibition of
    norepinephrine (an excitatory neurotransmitter) release,
    and cause a decrease in norepinephrine, so inhibiting neuronal
    excitability and firing by yet another mechanism.</p>
<p>In general, opioids overall have a significant inhibitory effect
    on physiological pain sensation, but cause different analgesia
    and tolerance in different conditions. The additional effects
    of opioids on mood clearly have a higher-function impact
    on the perception of the sensation known as pain.</p>
<h2>List of opioids commonly used in maxillofacial surgery</h2>
<p>Figure 4 depicts the chemical molecular structures of eleven
    commonly used opioids (fentanyl, alfentanil, remifentanil,
    morphine, diamorphine, oxycodone, pethidine, buprenorphine,
    tramadol, codeine, dihydrocodeine). Some agents fall into
    groups of chemically closely related substances.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The molecular structures of commonly
        prescribed opioids.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Adverse effects and other considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>sustained opioid consumption can produce paradoxical pain
        – nociceptive sensitisation (lowers pain thresholds)
        and analgesic tolerance;</li>
    <li>respiratory effects, cough suppression, nausea, vomiting,
        constipation and dependence (tolerance and addiction);</li>
    <li>codeine is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">pro-drug</a>        that first needs to be metabolised in the body to its
        active form (morphine). There is a wide variation of
        genetic patterns in the population with regard to the
        level of codeine metabolism which makes dosage difficult.
        For some people codeine does not work because it is not
        sufficiently converted, whereas for others the conversion
        rate is very high, potentially leading to unsafe high
        morphine levels and related adverse effects (a particular
        concern in children and frail elderly people, regarding
        respiratory failure);</li>
    <li>a number of opioids can be <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">delivered in non-oral ways</a>        that are helpful for maxillofacial patients when swallowing
        of pills is a problem. For example, fentanyl can be delivered
        by a skin patch, buprenorphine is available in a preparation
        for sublingual absorption through the oral mucosa.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Typical maxillofacial applications of opioids include</h2>
<ul>
    <li>role as part of <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>        medications;</li>
    <li>role as part of heavy sedation, for example in intensive
        care;</li>
    <li>pain control in late stages of palliation of cancer pain.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="sedatives">Sedatives</h1>
<h2>Mechanism</h2>
<p>There are different mechanisms of action for different classes
    of sedatives and these mechanisms of action are still incompletely
    understood. The general effect of sedatives appears to be
    to depress spontaneous and evoked activity of neurons, especially
    synaptic transmission. Three examples of different classes
    of sedatives are (there are more classes than these three)
     </p>
<ul>
    <li>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists;</li>
    <li>non-competitive NMDA antagonists;</li>
    <li><i>α</i><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agonists mimic an effect and activate their target, often enhancing
    its activity, whilst antagonists block the usual action of
    their target (Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Action of agonists and antagonists.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>GABA</strong><strong><sub>A</sub></strong> <strong>receptor agonists</strong>    bind to an allosteric site (a place on the receptor where
    a molecule that is not the usual substrate can bind) on the
    GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Binding of a GABA<sub>A</sub>        receptor agonist to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The binding of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/gaba">GABA</a>    to its receptor causes a conformational change, opening the
    channel and allowing Cl<sup>-</sup> ions into the cell. This
    causes increased negative charge inside the cell, causing
    hyperpolarisation of the neuron and decreasing the chance
    of an action potential (inhibition). The agonists do not
    activate the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor directly but enhance
    the effect of GABA, making an action potential even less
    likely and so intensifying the inhibitory effect.</p>
<p><strong>Non-competitive NMDA antagonists</strong> inhibit the
    action of the NMDA receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,
    an ion channel in nerve cells) by binding to an allosteric
    site on the receptor and deactivating it. The NMDA receptor
    is a glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter) receptor.
    When glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor, it causes ion
    channels to open, allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the
    cell, making the inside of the cell more positive, causing
    the formation of an action potential and a pain signal to
    be felt. Non-competitive NMDA antagonists bind to the NMDA
    receptor so that, when glutamate binds, the channels do not
    open, so stopping the formation of an action potential and
    inhibiting the pain signal.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of <strong><i>α</i></strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>-adrenoceptor agonists</strong>    for pain inhibition is currently poorly understood. These
    agents are thought to bind in an allosteric site and activate
    <i>α</i><sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, which are inhibitory
    in nature. Activation of <i>α</i><sub>2</sub>-adrenergic
    receptors on post-synaptic neurons then causes increased
    outwards conductance of potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>), reducing
    neuronal excitability and so inhibiting neuronal firing and
    stopping a pain signal from being felt. Many <i>α</i><sub>2</sub>-adrenergic
    receptors on pre-synaptic neurons are linked to inhibition
    of norepinephrine (an excitatory neurotransmitter) release.
    It is suggested that <i>α</i><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists
    may enhance the effect of <i>α</i><sub>2</sub>-adrenergic
    receptors on pre-synaptic neurons, causing a decrease in
    neurotransmitter signalling and so inhibiting the pain signal.</p>
<h2>List of sedatives commonly used in maxillofacial surgery</h2>
<p>Figure 7 depicts the chemical molecular structures of five commonly
    used sedatives (diazepam, midazolam, propofol, ketamine,
    clonidine). Diazepam, midazolam and propofol act as GABA<sub>A</sub>    receptor agonists, ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA antagonist,
    and clonidine is a <i>α</i><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist.
    Ketamine and clonidine are often administered together as
    co-analgesics.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The molecular structures of a
        range of sedatives.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Adverse effects and other considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>ketamine can cause psychoses and/or hallucinations, increased
        blood pressure (hypertension);</li>
    <li>propofol can cause hypotension (low blood pressure) and convulsions;</li>
    <li>clonidine can cause hypotension and bradycardia (fast heart
        beat).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Typical maxillofacial applications of sedatives include</h2>
<ul>
    <li>intravenous application to augment <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local anaesthesia</a>        for surgery;</li>
    <li>propofol (in the UK) used as an induction agent in <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>;</li>
    <li>clonidine is mainly used in intensive care settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that the definitions of intravenous sedation
    and intravenous anaesthesia differ quite radically in different
    countries. UK practice and North American practice are totally
    different in relation to the drugs used and who administers
    them. The UK limits the surgeon to single-agent techniques
    whereas the US routinely uses combinations delivered by a
    surgeon in an ‘office’ environment.</p>
<h1 id="local-analgesics">Local analgesics</h1>
<h2>Mechanism</h2>
<p>Local analgesics act by reversibly blocking impulse transmission
    in peripheral nerves, blocking a pain signal from being felt
    (Figure 8).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Local analgesic block of the sodium
        channels on neurons.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Local analgesics in their soluble form are injected as solutions
    in water. In tissues, a proportion of the drug dissociates
    to a lipid and a soluble free base, which can cross the neuronal
    lipid membrane. The free base blocks the sodium channels
    on the neuron which blocks the nerve action potential (Figure
    8). The small myelinated neurons are blocked first, with
    larger unmyelinated neurons being blocked last. The temporary
    loss of functions caused by the blocking occurs in the order:
    pain sensation =&gt; temperature sensation =&gt; sensitivity
    to mechanical stimulus =&gt; motor functions.</p>
<h2>List of local analgesics commonly used in maxillofacial surgery</h2>
<p>Figure 9 depicts the chemical molecular structures of five commonly
    used local analgesics (lidocaine, prilocaine, articaine,
    benzocaine, bupivacaine). These agents share a common molecular
    motif of an aromatic (usually 6-membered) ring structure
    joined to an amine group.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure9.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> The molecular structures of some
        local analgesics.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Adverse effects and other considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>allergic reactions;</li>
    <li>accidental injection directly into the blood stream;</li>
    <li>lidocaine does not select between Na<sup>+</sup> ion channels
        in neurons and those in other fibres;</li>
    <li>intra-nerve bundle (for example, inferior alveolar nerve)
        injection has been associated with permanent nerve damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Typical maxillofacial applications of local analgesics include</h2>
<ul>
    <li>many intraoral and <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth">dentoalveolar</a>        procedures are performed under local anaesthesia in an
        outpatient setting;</li>
    <li>as local anaesthesia peri-operatively;</li>
    <li>postoperative infiltration of surgical wounds with local
        anaesthetics (including donor sites in <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>);</li>
    <li>sometimes injected prior to incision in surgical procedures
        under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>        both as haemostatic agent (in <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/adrenaline">adrenaline</a>-containing
        preparations) and as pre-emptive analgesic or to reduce
        the amount of narcotic anaesthetic used in general anaesthesia;</li>
    <li>some preparations of local analgesics (benzocaine in particular,
        although it is associated with a higher incidence of
        hypersensitivity reactions) can be applied topically
        (gels or mouthwash) and are used to ease eating and/or
        oral hygiene postoperatively, or with painful <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">mucositis</a>        from <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        or <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>,
        or other painful <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">oral ulcerations</a>        and conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cyclooxygenase-2-cox-2-inhibitors">Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors</h1>
<h2>Mechanism</h2>
<p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
    drugs (NSAIDs; see above), have analgesic, antipyretic (prevent
    or reduce fever) and anti-inflammatory effects. Their mechanism
    of action is very similar to that of NSAIDs, with the main
    difference being that NSAIDs block COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes,
    whereas COX-2 inhibitors only block the COX-2 enzymes and
    thus the synthesis only of those <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a>    involved in response to tissue damage, causing inflammation
    and pain (Figure 10). This degree of selectivity holds promise
    to cause fewer adverse effects (on the GI tract) than traditional
    NSAIDs.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme
        by COX-2 inhibitors.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a side pocket in the catalytic site of the COX-2 enzyme,
    which is not present in the COX-1 enzyme. COX-2 inhibitors
    use this side pocket to selectively inhibit the COX-2 enzyme
    and not the COX-1 enzyme.</p>
<p>COX-2 inhibitors are thought to decrease endocannabinoid metabolism
    by inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme, which metabolises endocannabinoids.
    This causes an increase in endocannabinoids (naturally occurring
    substances in the body’s metabolism; chemically closely related
    to some of the components in cannabis (see below)), which
    have an analgesic effect. COX-2 inhibitors are less potent
    than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>The better selectivity of COX-2 inhibitors compared with traditional
    NSAIDs would appear to make COX-2 inhibitors attractive anti-inflammatory
    analgesic agents. Unfortunately, COX-2 inhibitors significantly
    increase the risk of cardiovascular complications and, therefore,
    are not first-line anti-inflammatory analgesic agents.</p>

<h2>Paracetamol</h2>
<p>Paracetamol (Figure 12) is a non-acidic antipyretic (prevent
    or reduce fever) analgesic. It is not known precisely where
    in the pain signalling cascade paracetamol works. It has
    been suggested that it is a relatively weak inhibitor of
    cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the brain, inhibiting
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/prostaglandins">prostaglandin synthesis</a>, but is not active in peripheral
        cyclooxygenase sites. The high lipophilicity (high solubility
        in fatty tissue) and the non-acidic nature of paracetamol
        are thought to facilitate permeation of paracetamol across
        the blood-brain barrier and into the central nervous
        system.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure12.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> The molecular structure of paracetamol.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Paracetamol lacks any significant anti-inflammatory properties.
    It has been suggested that this is due to its non-acidic
    nature and the resulting absence of enrichment in inflamed
    tissue, which is acidic. The analgesic effects of paracetamol
    tend to be weak due to low efficacy and so paracetamol is
    typically only suitable to treat mild pain (yet many anaesthetists
    swear by its efficacy when administered intravenously peri-
    and post-operatively).</p>
<p>Similar to the COX-2 inhibitors (see above), paracetamol is thought
    to decrease endocannabinoid metabolism by inhibiting the
    COX-2 enzyme. This causes an increased concentration of endocannabinoids,
    which have an analgesic effect.</p>
<p>Paracetamol causes increased blood pressure, an increased risk
    of cardiovascular events and is liver toxic (due to the production
    of reactive intermediates) but lacks the gastrointestinal
    tract toxicity and acute renal (kidney) toxicity that non-steroidal
    anti-inflammatory drugs have. Paracetamol is an example of
    a drug with a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed">narrow therapeutic window</a>,
    with only a small difference in dose required for analgesic
    effects and doses that lead to liver damage. Paracetamol
    is particularly popular in the UK.</p>
<p>Paracetamol is the standard first line analgesic for most people
    with toothache and is responsible for multiple cases of overdose
    related liver damage, including death. It is also used extensively
    in combination with codeine (see above) as a second line
    analgesic.</p>
<h2>Metamizole</h2>
<p>Metamizole (Figure 13), like paracetamol, is a non-acidic antipyretic
    (prevent or reduce fever) analgesic. It is thought to have
    a similar mechanism of action as paracetamol, as an inhibitor
    of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the brain. It has similar
    high lipophilicity and non-acidic properties as paracetamol,
    facilitating permeation across the blood-brain barrier and
    into the central nervous system. Metamizole has no significant
    anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure13.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> The molecular structure of metamizole.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Metamizole lacks the gastrointestinal tract toxicity and acute
    renal toxicity that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    have. However, metamizole does have blood toxicity and can
    cause rare but serious adverse effects (agranulocytosis).</p>
<p>Metamizole is not licenced in the UK but is widely used in Europe
    as a general analgesic as it is considerably more potent
    than paracetamol. It is an effective analgesic for bone pain
    and can be used on its own or in combination with other analgesic
    agents.</p>
<h2><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/botulinum">Botulinum toxin</a></h2>
<p>Botulinum toxin is a highly poisonous substance that acts as
    a powerful paralytic neurotoxin. Botulinum toxin works by
    inhibiting the release of the ubiquitous neurotransmitter
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a>.
    Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter that works
    at the neuromuscular junction. When acetylcholine is released
    by motor neurons, it activates the muscle. When acetylcholine
    is blocked, the muscle cannot be activated, so the muscle
    is paralysed (Figure 14).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure14.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 14:</strong> Blocking effect of botulinum
        toxin alpha on the acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular
        junction.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Botulinum toxin, amongst its <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/botulinum">many other medicinal applications</a>,
    can act as an effective analgesic in treating painful muscle
    spasms by temporarily paralysing the muscle.  </p>
<p>Botulinum toxin is extensively used to treat <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">myofascial pain</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">facial arthromyalgia</a>    (painful dysfunction syndrome of the temporomandibular (jaw)
    joint) and is demonstrably effective for periods of several
    months, sometimes needing repeating injections.</p>
<h2>Cannabinoids</h2>
<p>Cannabinoids are natural (synthesised in the body, endocannabinoids)
    and synthetic compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors.
    Cannabis is made up of many components of different cannabinoid
    ligands made up of many. Two such active components are tetrahydrocannabinol
    (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (Figure 15).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure15.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 15:</strong> The molecular structures of two
        active components of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
        and cannabidiol (CBD).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The two molecules have very similar structures but different
    effects. THC has relaxing psychoactive and/or analgesic effects,
    whereas CBD is not psychoactive but is suspected to hamper
    cognitive abilities. Depending on the preparation method,
    the ratios of THC and CBD vary. Natural cannabis products
    can have enhanced THC concentrations from selective breeding
    of the plants but this usually also enhances the CBD concentration.
    Medicinal cannabis preparations have controlled concentrations
    of THC extracts from plant material.</p>
<p>Cannabinoids act as analgesics in the brain, spinal cord and
    the peripheral nervous system. There are two main cannabinoid
    receptors, CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub>, although there
    are further receptors that cannabinoids can act on.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of cannabinoids when bound to the cannabinoid
    receptors is not completely known. There are structural similarities
    between cannabinoid receptors and G protein-coupled receptors
    (opioid receptors). The two types of receptors and ligands
    are thought to have similar mechanisms of action. On pre-synaptic
    neurons, the binding is thought to cause inhibition of the
    voltage-dependent calcium channels (Figure 16), which causes
    a decrease in the release of neurotransmitters (such as substance
    P) and stops the pain signal from crossing the synapse.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure16.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 16:</strong> Inhibition of voltage-dependent
        calcium channels by cannabinoids.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On post-synaptic neurons, binding of cannabinoids to cannabinoid
    receptors is thought to activate potassium channels, stopping
    depolarisation and inhibiting neuronal firing by decreasing
    neuronal excitability. Cannabinoids are also thought to cause
    some pain relief by descending inhibition, similar to opioids
    (see above).</p>
<p>Cannabinoids have an inhibitory effect on <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">neuropathic pain</a>,
    for example in neurodegenerative conditions such as multiple
    sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease, or can reduce / prevent
    seizures in some epilepsy conditions. The main analgesic
    effect of cannabinoids is thought to be a reduction of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">hyperalgesia and allodynia</a>.</p>
<p>A preparation of medicinal THC and CBD extracts in the form of
    an oral spray has been used as part of palliation in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oral squamous cell carcinoma</a>    and may actually have a direct cellular effect. There are
    certainly arguments for its systemic use as an antiemetic
    (preventing vomiting), mood enhancing, appetite promoting
    analgesic but its use is not yet established in the mainstream.</p>
<h1 id="anticonvulsants/antiepileptics-and-antidepressants">Anticonvulsants/Antiepileptics and Antidepressants</h1>
<p>Antiepileptics/anticonvulsants and antidepressants both have
    a second life / fringe activity as analgesics. These agents
    are not designed as analgesics but have been found to act
    in some cases, in low dosage well below that needed for antiepileptic
    / antidepressant effect, as analgesics in the treatment of
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-pain-syndrome/more-info">chronic and neuropathic pain conditions</a>.
    The mechanisms of action of these agents as analgesics are
    poorly understood but are thought to work in a number of
    different locations.</p>
<h2>Gabapentin and pregabalin</h2>
<p>Gabapentin and pregabalin (Figure 17) are analogues of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/gaba">GABA</a>.
    Both act as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiepileptics">antiepileptics</a>    and neuromodulators. Despite being GABA analogues, they have
    no activity against GABA receptors, channels or transporters.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure17.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 17:</strong> The molecular structures of gabapentin
        and pregabalin.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The mechanism of analgesic action of gabapentin and pregabalin
    is thought to be due to their high affinity for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">voltage-gated calcium channels</a>,
    causing a reduction in the influx of calcium ions into cells
    and thus stopping the release of excitatory neurotransmitters
    at synapses in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Pregabalin is more potent than gabapentin, so is more likely
    than gabapentin to have dose levels that are both effective
    and tolerable in the treatment of neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Gabapentin and pregabalin are regularly used for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">neuropathic pain</a>    of a variety of origins. The two drugs are less effective
    in treating <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">trigeminal neuralgia</a>.</p>
<h2>Carbamazepine</h2>
<p>Carbamazepine (Figure 18) is also an antiepileptic and is the
    drug of choice for treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome/detailed">trigeminal neuralgia</a>.
    It is also used in the diagnosis of this condition because
    of its unique efficacy for this condition.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure18.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 18:</strong> The molecular structure of carbamazepine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main mechanism of action of carbamazepine is by binding to
    inactivated sodium channels and stopping them from becoming
    active again, effectively blocking voltage-gated sodium channels
    and stopping the action potential moving along the neuron.
    Carbamazepine also has some action against voltage-gated
    calcium channels, similar to the working mechanisms of gabapentin
    and pregabalin (see above), and it increases the amount of
    the inhibitory neurotransmitter <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/gaba">GABA</a>.</p>
<h2>Fluoxetine and Phenothiazine</h2>
<p>Fluoxetine (Figure 19) is an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antidepressants">antidepressant agent</a>    with a slightly stimulating effect.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure19.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 19:</strong> The molecular structures of fluoxetine
        and phenothiazine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It acts as a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, blocking
    serotonin (a neurotransmitter) re-uptake in synapses in the
    central nervous system. This allows serotonin to stay in
    the synapse for longer and have a greater prolonged inhibitory
    effect on the post-synaptic receptor, which can block pain
    signals (Figure 20). Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
    act on multiple receptors with multiple effects.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure20.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 20:</strong> Blocking of serotonin re-uptake
        in synapses by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fluoxetine is sometimes combined with phenothiazine (Figure 19),
    a neuroleptic agent (an antipsychotic drug with a slight
    sedative action). This combination has been shown to be sometimes
    more powerful as an analgesic than an antidepressant drug
    alone.</p>
<p>Antidepressant agents have been shown to provide good pain relief
    in particular for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">allodynia</a>    (pain response from stimuli which do not normally provoke
    a pain sensation). Long-term use of antidepressants does
    carry a small but significant risk of gastrointestinal or
    post-surgical bleeding, but this is not a serious risk when
    used in low dose for the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions.</p>
<h2>Amitriptyline and Nortriptyline</h2>
<p>Amitriptyline and nortriptyline are tricyclic <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antidepressants">antidepressant agents</a>    with potential for neuropathic pain relief (Figure 21).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-pain-level3-figure21.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 21:</strong> The molecular structures of amitriptyline
        and nortriptyline.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Amitriptyline interacts with many different receptors on nerve
    cells, including opioid and histamine receptor sites. It
    is also known to have some blocking effects on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">sodium and potassium ion channels</a>    in the central nervous system as well as reducing the re-uptake
    of noradrenaline. All of these mechanisms are thought to
    contribute to the analgesic effects of amitriptyline (and
    other tricyclic antidepressants) as they all play a role
    in chronic neuropathic pain conditions.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">pro-drug</a>    and is metabolised to nortriptyline (Figure 21). Nortriptyline
    hinders the re-uptake of both serotonin and noradrenaline
    (neurotransmitters) at different types of neurons. This gives
    a sedative effect at low doses and can improve sleep when
    taken at night.</p>
<p>Antidepressants have been shown to provide good pain relief in
    particular for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">allodynia</a>    (pain response from stimuli which do not normally provoke
    a pain sensation). Long-term use of antidepressants does
    carry a small but significant risk of gastrointestinal or
    post-surgical bleeding, but this is not a serious risk when
    used in low dose for the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-treatments">Miscellaneous treatments</h1>
<p>As far as management of pain, in particular chronic pain, is
    concerned, there are a number of non-invasive options with
    poor evidence of efficacy – but which at least are likely
    to do little harm (other than to the wallet). Such non-invasive
    options include</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/help/mental-health">cognitive behavioural therapy</a>        and other forms of talking therapies;</li>
    <li>relaxation techniques such as <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/biofeedback">biofeedback</a>        and similar approaches;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/acupuncture">acupuncture</a>;</li>
    <li>application of <a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/lilt">low-intensity (low-level) laser (or other light) therapy</a>,
        advertised in alternative medicine;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/miscellaneous/tens">transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</a>        is claimed to provide short-term pain relief in some
        instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>If conventional (and alternative) medical therapies fail to relieve
    pain, more invasive techniques such as <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">cryotherapy</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">peripheral nerve blocks</a>,
    or percutaneous destruction of a nerve ganglion (commonly
    the trigeminal nerve) may be necessary. Sometimes neurosurgical
    interventions such as microvascular decompression of the
    root of the trigeminal nerve are indicated where it has been
    demonstrated that a microvascular loop compresses the trigeminal
    nerve. Overall, invasive methods for the management of pain
    conditions are rarely indicated.</p>
<p>There are numerous areas of overlap between medical management
    of pain, as discussed in this section, and working principles
    of <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general and local anaesthesia</a>    as well as intensive care.</p>
