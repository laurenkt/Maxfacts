<p>Our experience of eating is a complex mixture of contributions
    from different senses (taste and smell), the texture and
    temperature of foods, habits and social situations, our sense
    of (visual) aesthetics, sensual pleasures, as well as the
    clever ways in which nature runs our appetite in order to
    ensure that our bodies get the necessary <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">nutrition</a>.
    Concentrating on our sense of taste and the texture and temperature
    of food and drink is therefore a massive simplification but
    is helpful to gain some understanding of the interplay of
    food and drink with <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">eating / swallowing</a>.
    This is important to understand the normal functions, what
    happens when they are compromised and, hence, how one can
    best mitigate such difficulties by all kinds of <a href="/help/oral-food/practical-tips">practical tricks</a>    and how the modification of texture and temperature of foods
    enables oral food intake even in difficult circumstances.</p>
<h1 id="taste"><a href="/help/oral-food/further-reading">Taste</a></h1>
<p>Taste information is sensed in small structures, called taste
    buds, distributed over the tongue (see Figure 1).</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/ttt/detailed/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Distribution of taste buds over
        the tongue.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A few more taste buds are found in the area of the soft palate
    and the cheeks. For many years it was believed that different
    areas of the tongue are responsible for sensing different
    tastes. This is incorrect, there are no special regions of
    the tongue that are tuned to sense a particular taste: all
    types of tastes are registered in all areas of the tongue.</p>
<p>Similar to the complicated process of <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowing</a>    or the highly <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">regulated production</a>    and <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">complex properties</a>    of saliva, also the story of tasting is a rather complicated
    one. Figure 2 summarizes the process where everything works
    as it should.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/ttt/detailed/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The various different components
        and agents that break down food such that it can interact
        with taste receptor cells in the taste buds. The <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">components in saliva</a>        that help with chewing and swallowing are the same that
        also help to expose very small food particles to the
        taste receptor cells. The little green symbol “Toxin”
        signifies essentially bitter tastes (see text).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we put food in the mouth, it usually needs to be chewed in
    order to break it down into smaller bits. However, the mechanical
    work of literally grinding down solid food into smaller bits
    is not the only process that needs to run smoothly. The action
    of saliva is not only required to enable the formation of
    a smooth and soft <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">bolus that is easy to swallow</a>,
    saliva also acts as a solvent that facilitates tasting. This
    explains well why people suffering from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>    usually report distorted or diminished taste.</p>
<p>Some of the active components in saliva help to produce microscopically
    small food particles that can access the taste receptor cells
    via the taste pores of the taste buds. This mechanism also
    works when eating soft or liquid foods that do not require
    chewing. Once the small food particles have passed the taste
    pore they will stimulate the taste receptor cells in the
    taste bud. The taste receptor cells, when stimulated, send
    taste signals to the brain and ultimately it is the brain
    that provides us with the perception and impression of taste.
    The various taste receptor cells are highly specialised and
    only register particular types of basic tastes.</p>
<p>Taste receptor cells are equipped with specialised protein molecules
    (or complexes of more than one protein) which specialise
    in recognising specific taste agents. We have five, more
    probably six (or even more), distinct basic taste receptors
    as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/ttt/detailed/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The six basic tastes as identified
        by various receptor protein complexes (as far as currently
        known – <a href="/help/oral-food/further-reading">there may be another basic taste &quot;starchy&quot;</a>).
        A basic taste “fat” is not traditionally included in
        the basic set of distinguishable tastes but there is
        convincing and growing evidence that this is a taste
        in its own right. The abbreviations CD36, GPRI20, GPR40,
        T1R1, T1R3 and T1R2 are all short names / laboratory
        jargon of biochemists to identify specific proteins or
        protein families that are known to be involved as
        <a href="/help/oral-food/further-reading">taste receptor proteins</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A group of proteins (CD36, GPR120, GPR40) have recently been
    identified as highly likely to be sensing a taste “fatty”.
    Savoury / umami taste is carried by an amino acid, glutamic
    acid, and its Na<sup>+</sup> salt. Glutamic acid is, for
    example found in soy sauce, roast meats or roast mushrooms.
    The role of umami / savoury taste is to stimulate the appetite
    so that we wish to eat protein and nourish the body. Umami
    is sensed by a complex of two proteins, T1R1 + T1R3.</p>
<p>The protein complex T1R2 + T1R3 is responsible for sensing sweet
    taste. The most likely biologically useful role of this taste
    receptor is to give us an appetite for carbohydrates to curb
    acute hunger pangs and provide a quick energy boost.</p>
<p>A group of ca. 30 different T2R proteins all sense bitter taste.
    The little green label “Toxin” for bitter taste in Figure
    3 refers to our evolutionary history. We have so many different
    taste receptors for bitter taste because avoiding eating
    toxic or rotten foods was crucially important for our species
    to survive; most toxic or rotten foods would tend to come
    with a bitter taste.</p>
<p>The taste receptors register “their” special taste agents by
    sensing common structural features in say, a range of different
    kinds of sugar molecules, all of which will then stimulate
    a response from those taste receptors with special features
    to recognise these typical sugar structural units, resulting
    in a signal “sweet” transmitted to (and from) the brain.</p>
<p>The two tastes salty and sour are triggered by Na<sup>+</sup>    (and a few other) ions and by H<sup>+</sup> ions, respectively.
    Seemingly these two tastes are the simplest, their presence
    is well established but it is currently not known how exactly
    these two tastes are being sensed. There are suggestions
    that the mechanisms for tasting salty and sour do not require
    taste receptor protein complexes but may simply be due to
    flow of Na<sup>+</sup> and / or H<sup>+</sup> ions across
    cell membranes.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is well established that stimulating the various
    taste receptors sends taste signals to the brain <em>via</em>    taste neurons (see Figure 2). However, it is not at all clear
    how our rich and subtle experiences of taste (and smell)
    arise from just sensing six basic taste varieties.</p>
<p>The sense of taste can be compromised in many different ways.
    For example, medication (in particular <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy drugs</a>    and some antibiotics) can cause bad and/or distorted taste
    perception. <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</a>    can cause damage to taste buds and salivary glands and alter
    or diminish taste, as can <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>    as a symptom of other underlying conditions. Neurological
    conditions as well as damage by surgery to nerves essential
    for transmitting taste information to/from the brain can
    impair taste; and even the normal process of ageing will
    gradually reduce our taste acuity as we get older.</p>
<p>The latter is a reason why usually specially prepared (commercial)
    soft foods for elderly people are not suitable for oral and
    maxillofacial patients: these foods are usually fairly strongly
    seasoned, to account for lacking taste acuity in many elderly
    people.</p>
<p>This short account of what we know about the working of our sense
    of taste hints at a wide range of possibilities to maximise
    the taste experience in situations where our sense of taste
    may be severely compromised.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you would like to read more about ways to maximise the
        taste experience, have a look at our collection of
        <a href="/help/oral-food/texture-adaption/detailed">taste exploitation tricks</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="texture"><a href="/help/oral-food/further-reading">Texture</a></h1>
<p>The reality for many maxillofacial patients is that they will
    encounter some kind of short- or longer-term difficulties
    with eating, sometimes these are permanent problems.</p>
<p>The good news is that this does not mean that anybody has to
    give up on their favourite tastes and flavours, but some
    compromise regarding the food texture may be necessary: almost
    all flavours and tastes can be prepared in a very wide range
    of textures at different temperatures. There should be some
    suitable preparations for almost everybody!</p>
<p>The best way to think about this wide field of possible textures
    of foods is to abandon our traditional and often fairly narrow-minded
    views of meals such as breakfast / lunch / dinner over the
    day, or starter / main course / dessert making up a typical
    meal. These ideas are just a reflection of western food traditions
    and are not a law written in stone; why not to have pea soup
    for breakfast if that works! Your care and support team,
    the <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapist</a>    or dietitian, will give you some general basic recommendations
    for food that is safe for you to eat, their recommendations
    will be mainly defined by the texture of foods.</p>
<p>The textures (and temperature) of foods are the organisational
    principle of the <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">Maxfacts cookbook</a>    too. Whatever combination of texture / temperature works
    for you at a given point in time will usually allow you to
    prepare a well-balanced and varied diet in that particular
    texture. Below we briefly describe the different categories
    of food textures most relevant for people afflicted by some
    kind of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">eating difficulty</a>.
    It needs to be remembered that there are many different dysphagia
    problems and not all recommendations will be suitable for
    all conditions. For example, some people will experience
    difficulties swallowing liquids and, accordingly, will benefit
    from tricks that make liquids ‘less liquid’; others may only
    be able to swallow liquids and will thus be interested in
    the wide range of liquid foods one can prepare.</p>
<h2>Foams</h2>
<p>Foams are sometimes called “tasty air”, which is a fairly good
    description. Foams are highly dispersed liquids obtained
    after vigorous whipping, stabilised by some thickener and/or
    emulsifier. Foams a can be produced from most liquids and
    are best when made from strongly flavoured liquids. There
    is no need to swallow a foam but it will still provide taste
    stimulation in the mouth. The main use of foams in a care
    setting (outside the high-end Michelin star cuisines – no
    joke!) is in intensive and palliative care, often trying
    to provide some gustatory stimulation for neurological patients
    who literally will have to re-learn how to taste and swallow
    (for example, after a massive stroke, or when slowly waking
    up from a long coma).</p>
<p>For maxillofacial patients foams can have several useful roles,
    given that there is no need to swallow foams. Foams can be
    a tailor-made tasty way to keep the mouth moist. If somebody
    completely depends on a feeding tube for taking up enough
    nutrition, then any taste stimulation is completely missing.
    This lack of stimulation may be responsible for a lack of
    “drive” to return to oral feeding (given that taste triggers
    our appetites). Using foams to provide taste stimulation
    (and hence motivation to try and eat) can be helpful in the
    process of returning to food by mouth. For those who can
    and try to eat but suffer from insufficient saliva production,
    foams can be a useful appetiser that triggers / boosts saliva
    production before eating a meal. This usually also works
    for people with a diminished sense of taste if their sense
    of smell is working: much of the flavour of a foam is noticed
    by its smell rather than its taste.</p>
<h2>Liquids</h2>
<p>Equipped with a reasonable household blender and using some suitable
    dilution, almost all (solid) foods can be liquidised. In
    order to produce a completely smooth liquid texture, the
    liquid needs to be passed through a fine-meshed sieve before
    serving (or further processing / cooking). Liquid foods can
    be prepared across all savoury and sweet tastes, and over
    a wide range of temperatures. There are degrees of thickness
    liquid foods can take (some people may find slightly thicker
    but still drinkable foods more satisfying as a meal).</p>
<p>When having to rely on a liquid diet, by necessity the foods
    are diluted and it may be a challenge to eat enough to ensure
    provision of all necessary nutrients. Many liquid foods,
    in particular when dairy based, can easily be enriched with
    supplements and/or by using rich diluting agents, such as
    concentrated stock or cream.</p>
<p>Liquid foods include preparations such as custard (which many
    praise as excellent lubricating agent for all kinds of foods)
    as a representative of foods with a particularly silky consistency
    owing to the <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">emulsifying properties</a>    of egg yolk. Adding egg yolk to other liquid foods may be
    useful, not just because of its emulsifying properties but
    also because egg yolk is an excellent source of protein.</p>
<p>Completely smooth liquids have a second role in the kitchen as
    starting materials for the preparation of jellies. Essentially
    all liquids can be made into jellies, savoury and sweet.
    In addition, smooth liquids also serve as starting materials
    for preparing very soft, very smooth foods such as mousses
    (which are usually stabilised by a little gelatin).</p>
<h2>Jellies</h2>
<p>Preparation of a jelly starts with a smooth liquid or thin smooth
    puree, across a wide range of savoury or sweet starting materials.
    Jellies are particularly easy to swallow due to their slipperiness
    (especially when made with ordinary gelatin, these jellies
    melt at approximately body temperature). Jellies are, in
    a sense, liquids in disguise and can be a good way to take
    in enough fluid by mouth when swallowing liquids is difficult
    or impossible.</p>
<p>Wobbly, that is softly set, jellies can be useful and tasty
    <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubricants</a> to help eating when suffering from dry mouth.</p>
<p>There are many different gelling and thickening agents, all of
    which have slightly different properties and thus produce
    jellies with a range of different properties. When made with
    some gelling agents other than gelatin, for example the resulting
    jelly will be a little more brittle but could be heated to
    provide a warm meal.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about gelling and thickening agents,
        there is more information on our page about <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">food-texture modifying agents</a>.</p>
</aside>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to see how easy it is to use some of these
        agents, have a look at some of our <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">cooking videos</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The crucial ingredient for making jellies (apart from the gelling
    agent) is water. Accordingly, many jellies are predominantly
    water based. However, dairy such as milk or cream contain
    enough water to make dairy-based jellies. If you have problems
    swallowing liquids but thoroughly miss your cuppa, making
    tea or coffee jellies provides an alternative. And if there
    is reason to celebrate with a bit of a tipple, jellies can
    also be made with (somewhat diluted) alcohol, for example
    wine, port or G &amp; T.</p>
<h2>Soft foods (without chunks and bits)</h2>
<p>This is a wide selection of foods, savoury and sweet, that do
    not need chewing. The category includes traditional pureed
    foods as well as foods made from purees and liquids such
    mousses and flans / set custards. As with liquid foods, in
    order to prepare a perfectly smooth consistency without chunks
    and bits, it will be necessary to pass the purees through
    a fine-meshed sieve before serving or further processing.
    Basic purees are convenient and versatile starting materials
    for many different dishes; they can usually be frozen and
    are a compact storage form for having a quick-start meal
    at hand at all times.</p>
<p>Pureed foods may be easier to eat when combined with sauces or
    other <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubricants</a>.
    Set custards and flans benefit from the in-built lubricating
    effect of egg yolk. Mousses are usually stabilised with gelatin
    and thus also have some degree of in-built slipperiness.
    Mousses and flans have textures that many people find comfortable
    to eat. The preferred degrees of compactness of purees will
    be individually different, will likely change over time and
    will depend on temperature and specific foods.</p>
<h2>Soft foods (with chunks and bits)</h2>
<p>This is the only category of foods in our selection where different
    textures of foods are mixed. We are still dealing with soft
    foods which will only require a minimum effort with chewing
    or no chewing. A typical example of such foods would be small
    chunks of well cooked, soft carrot in a thick and creamy
    cheese sauce.</p>
<p>Having two different textures combined in one food gives more
    parameters to adjust and it is important to get the mix of
    textures right for individual needs and preferences – and
    these may vary widely. Some may prefer small soft bits in
    plenty of nearly liquid sauce, while others will prefer a
    more uniform overall texture of tiny “bits” and thick “sauce”.</p>
<p>For some people this category of mixed textures will be a stepping
    stone on the way back to “ordinary” foods. For others with
    reduced sensation in the oral cavity and/or of the tongue
    a suitably adjusted mixture of food textures can help with
    processing and moving food during the <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">oral phase of swallowing</a>    and with forming a bolus that will trigger the natural swallowing
    reflex, rather than having to wash food down.</p>
<h1 id="temperature"><a href="/help/oral-food/further-reading">Temperature</a></h1>
<p>The temperature of the foods we eat has a major impact on our
    taste and smell, and more generally overall eating, experience.
    The colder the food is the less we will be able to smell
    it. This may be an advantage for those people who are put
    off from eating by the smell of food. Frozen foods, in particular
    smooth ice creams, are more tolerable to eat with a sore
    mouth than foods at higher temperatures. More generally,
    many people find that foods that are difficult to eat at
    higher temperatures tend to be easier to eat when cold or
    frozen. Some people can take advantage of temperature contrast
    which is thought to help with triggering the swallowing reflex:
    taking a small mouthful of warm vegetable soup, followed
    by a small mouthful of, say goats’ cheese ice cream, and
    so on can make for a more pleasant, less stressful eating
    experience. Being patient and keeping food in the mouth for
    a little while before swallowing will not only help with
    mixing it with saliva and enhancing the taste perception
    in this way, it will also increase the ability to smell the
    food as the temperature of cold foods increases when kept
    in the mouth.</p>
<p>It is probably best to consider the temperature of foods as a
    freely adjustable parameter, optimised according to needs
    and preferences. We are not aware of any law saying that
    mushroom soup must be eaten piping hot…</p>
<p>There are many tried and tested recipes and suggestions for foods
    in sometimes unconventional textures and temperatures in
    the <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">Maxfacts cookbook</a>.
    In addition, we demonstrate some possibly less familiar (but
    commonly straightforward) preparations in <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">cooking videos</a>.</p>
