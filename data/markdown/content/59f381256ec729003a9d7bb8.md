<h2>Local anaesthesia</h2>
<p>During local anaesthesia drugs are injected using a fine needle
    around an area to make the tissue numb before surgery starts.
    The patient remains fully awake during this procedure. Local
    anaesthesia is given by the surgeon immediately before performing
    the surgical procedure.</p>
<p>There are many types of local anaesthetic drugs available. In
    the UK, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">lidocaine and bupivacaine</a>    are the most frequently used. This type of anaesthesia is
    very safe and can be used for many types of minor surgery.</p>
<p>Side effects are very rare. These include allergic reactions
    to the local anaesthetic and accidental injection of local
    anaesthetic into the bloodstream.</p>
<h2>Sedation</h2>
<p>In some circumstances a patient who is too anxious to comply
    with surgery under local anaesthesia might be offered sedation.
    This is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">drug</a>    usually <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">given intravenously</a>    to make the patient more relaxed. It does not make the patient
    fall asleep. This type of procedure can only be used in specialised
    clinics.</p>
<h2>General anaesthesia</h2>
<p>This is commonly required for many maxillofacial operations.
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">Anaesthetic drugs</a>    are administered to the patient by a doctor who specialises
    in giving anaesthetics (anaesthetist). These procedures can
    only be carried out in a hospital setting. Patients are rendered
    unconscious for the duration of the operation.</p>
<p>Before having an anaesthetic all patients are assessed by an
    anaesthetist to make sure that they are medically fit enough
    for anaesthesia. There is also opportunity for the patient
    to ask questions and to express concerns or fears.</p>
<p>Anaesthetic drugs are given intravenously through a cannula in
    most circumstances (see Figure 1).</p>

        back of hand and secured.</figcaption>

<p>Small children may be given <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">anaesthetic gas</a>    to induce anaesthesia. Once the patient is asleep a breathing
    tube is passed through the mouth or the nose to ensure breathing
    is controlled during the operation. In a few special circumstances
    an artificial opening for a breathing tube has to be created
    by the surgeon, with direct access to the windpipe, a so
    called <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer">tracheostomy</a>.
    Pain relief is given during the procedure so that the patient
    wakes up feeling comfortable.</p>
<p>All patients are fully monitored during the procedure and an
    anaesthetist is constantly with the patient until they wake
    up.</p>
<p>Common side effects of general anaesthesia include</p>
<ul>
    <li>nausea and vomiting</li>
    <li>drowsiness</li>
    <li>sore throat and nose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Less commonly, serious reactions to the anaesthetic may occur.</p>
<p>Very rarely general anaesthesia can be life threatening.</p>
<p>Following a procedure under general anaesthesia the patient stays
    in a recovery room for some time to make sure that they safely
    recover from anaesthesia. Once the patient is fully awake
    and stable they are returned to the hospital ward.</p>
<p>Some patients may go home the same day, others need to stay in
    hospital. This is dependent on the medical fitness of the
    patient and the complexity of the operation.</p>
