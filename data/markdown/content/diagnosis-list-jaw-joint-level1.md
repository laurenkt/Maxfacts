<p>Disorders affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ; jaw joint)
    are very common, they are one of the most common reasons
    for people to attend a maxillofacial clinic. It has been
    said that TMJ pain and disorders are to a maxillofacial surgeon
    what low back pain is to an orthopaedic surgeon: a common
    problem, often difficult to treat and not fully understood.</p>
<h2>Common temporomandibular joint disorders</h2>
<ul>
    <li>TMJ pain dysfunction syndrome / facial arthromyalgia (chronic
        pain): up to 75 % of the population have signs</li>
    <li>internal derangement (fault in the joint): up to 25 % of
        the population have signs</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a> and dislocation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uncommon temporomandibular joint disorders</h2>
<ul>
    <li>degenerative (wear and tear) joint disease</li>
    <li>inflammatory joint disease</li>
    <li>ankylosis (stiff joint from fusion of the bones)</li>
    <li>condylar hyperplasia or hypoplasia (abnormal growth (too
        much or too little, respectively) of a part of the mandible,
        the condyle (the knuckle of the mandible in the jaw joint))</li>
    <li>idiopathic condylar resorption (breaking down of condyle
        bone tissue by resorption, unknown cause)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rare temporomandibular joint disorders</h2>
<ul>
    <li>infective arthritis (joint inflammation)</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">malignant</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">non-malignant tumours</a>        of the temporomandibular joint</li>
</ul>
