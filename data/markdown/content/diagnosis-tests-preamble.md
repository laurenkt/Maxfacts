<p>The process of arriving at a diagnosis much resembles a detective
    story. Its success relies heavily on good levels of open
    minded communication with your doctor, both ways, and engaging
    with their questions in order to find out about your <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    and your current problems. It helps if you can resist any
    temptations to speculate about your problem as this may distract
    you from concentrating on the communication and conversation
    with your doctor. This conversation alone often goes a long
    way in the process, especially in combination with a thorough
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">medical examination</a>.</p>
<p>A whole arsenal of methods and techniques are available and widely
    used to exclude and/or confirm some diagnoses. Taking a tissue
    sample for further examination (a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>)
    usually clarifies an initial tentative diagnosis. Many different
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microbiological methods</a>    and biochemical marker molecules in your <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/urine-tests">urine</a> provide
    information about many conditions and their severity as well
    as giving information about the safety of exposing you to
    various diagnostic and other procedures.</p>
<p>In addition to these methods based on the chemical and biochemical
    behaviour of your body, many physical effects and techniques
    are also useful to gather information about the structure
    and/or function of your body. These physical techniques include
    ordinary <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiographs</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a> where
    a large number of  X-ray ‘pictures’ are taken in one series
    to obtain a three-dimensional image of parts of your body.
    Sometimes CT scanning is combined with positron emission
    tomography, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/pet-scans">PET scans</a>.
    PET scans rely on signals emitted from very small amounts
    of radioactive materials and provide three-dimensional images.</p>
<p>A third physical method that yields three-dimensional images
    is magnetic resonance imaging, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>.
    MRI relies on strong external magnetic fields and radiofrequency
    irradiation which is a very low energy irradiation and does
    not harm body tissues. All three imaging techniques have
    strengths and weaknesses which complement each other and
    thus will be used for different purposes. Another commonly
    used low-energy irradiation technique predominantly for imaging
    of soft tissues is based on <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>    waves.</p>
