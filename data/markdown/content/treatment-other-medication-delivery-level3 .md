<p>Below we discuss in slightly more detail the general principles
    of the journey of a medicinal drug through the body. We also
    sketch some basic principles and properties of organic molecules
    in the solid state, how these properties impact the preparation
    and suitability / bioavailability of drugs, how and why the
    production conditions are crucially important for quality
    control – and how this all relates to instructions on medication
    packs on how to store and use the medication.</p>
<h1 id="drug-timings-and-dosage">Drug timings and dosage</h1>
<h2>Drug activation and deactivation</h2>
<p>Once a drug has been absorbed, has reached its site of action
    and performed its function, it has to be eliminated from
    the body.</p>
<p>For systemically delivered drugs, the bloodstream delivers the
    drug to all of the body’s organs. The distribution of the
    drug between the organs depends on their size and blood supply.
    Drugs carried in the bloodstream are present in two forms,
    either bound to proteins in the blood or unbound. For a drug
    to be effective it has to be predominantly unbound: only
    in this form will it be able to pass through membranes and
    reach its site of action. The bloodstream also takes the
    drug to those organs that will eliminate it from the body.
    The main removal organs are the liver where most drugs are
    metabolised (broken down or otherwise chemically modified)
    and the kidneys from where drugs and/or their metabolites
    are excreted into urine.</p>
<p>The kidneys can excrete water-soluble substances. These are substances
    that have a low molecular weight and/or are polar, or even
    fully ionised, molecules at physiological conditions (pH;
    the acidity levels of body fluids). Most drug molecules do
    not belong to this category of water-soluble substances,
    most drugs are lipophilic (soluble in fat) organic substances.
    In the liver, these drug molecules are processed (metabolised)
    and chemically modified to transform them into compounds
    that are water-soluble and can be readily excreted <i>via</i>    the kidneys. This process is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Sketch of two principal mechanisms
        to transform drug substances ready for excretion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For some drugs, the molecules are broken down into smaller, more
    readily water-soluble fragments. Alternatively, drug molecules
    can be chemically modified (usually by attaching polar groups,
    such as OH groups to the molecular frame) to obtain more
    readily soluble products. Most products of this process are
    less active than the parent compound. In some cases, however,
    metabolites may be responsible for toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic
    or carcinogenic effects.</p>
<p>For example, the analgesic ibuprofen is a non-polar organic substance
    that is insufficiently soluble in water for direct excretion
    by the kidneys. Instead, the drug is almost completely metabolised
    in the body before excretion. The primary route of elimination
    for ibuprofen is by metabolism in the liver (using the cytochrome
    P450 enzymes; the main chemical ‘factory’ in the liver for
    the processing of drug molecules and other substances) where
    the ibuprofen molecules are transformed into inactive but
    more soluble metabolites, carboxy-ibuprofen and 2-hydroxy-ibuprofen.
    These two metabolites are soluble in water, so can be excreted
    <i>via</i> the kidneys.</p>
<p>Sometimes metabolites are actually the active therapeutic substance.
    In this case, the drug being taken is called a pro-drug.
    A pro-drug is a substance that has no, or a lower, activity
    against a target site than one of its major metabolites.
    A well-known example of a pro-drug is codeine which needs
    to be metabolised to its active <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/other">metabolite morphine</a>.
    The delivery of pro-drugs is symbolised in Figure 2.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The principle of using a pro-drug
        to reach a target site.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In general, pro-drugs are used to improve delivery or kinetic
    properties of a drug. Use of a pro-drug is sometimes a way
    to reduce toxicity of a drug, or to achieve a more target-specific
    delivery (to specific cells or tissues).</p>
<p>An important example of a pro-drug is levodopa, which is used
    to treat Parkinson’s disease (a degenerative neurological
    condition where lack of dopamine production in the brain
    leads to parts of the brain not functioning properly). Levodopa
    is an amino acid precursor to dopamine. Dopamine cannot be
    directly replenished in the brain of patients with Parkinson’s
    disease because the dopamine molecules are too polar to be
    able to cross the blood-brain barrier. While levodopa is
    also a polar molecule, it does get complexed by proteins
    that carry amino acids across the blood-brain barrier. Once
    in the brain, levodopa is converted to dopamine by the enzyme
    DOPA decarboxylase.</p>
<p>For a drug to reach its site of action and to produce a response,
    it must first pass through multiple membranes in the body.
    Figure 3 shows a sketch of the structure of a membrane.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Sketch of the structure of a membrane.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The solubility of a drug in both aqueous and lipid (fatty, non-polar)
    environments will determine how easily it can pass through
    membranes because membranes are made of lipids. To pass through
    the body’s membranes a drug needs to either be soluble in
    lipids, or it needs to mimic some of the body’s natural compounds
    (like amino acids) to pass through protein channels in the
    membrane (see Figure 3). How well a drug can pass through
    membranes and travel around the body will have an effect
    on how a drug has to be administered. The target site, and
    the membranes the drug must pass through to get there, will
    have an effect on the acceptable size of a drug molecule.
    For example, drugs that need to get through the blood-brain
    barrier will need to be smaller than for passage through
    most other membranes.</p>
<p>There are several types of components that drugs interact with
    in order to produce physiological and biochemical effects.
    The most common sites of interaction are proteins (receptors
    and enzymes) and DNA. When a drug interacts with an enzyme
    it can act as an inducer (increasing enzyme synthesis) or
    as an activator (increasing enzyme activity). Some drugs
    act as inhibitors (decreasing enzyme activity). Drugs that
    interact with receptors can either act as agonists (increasing
    the receptor response) or as antagonists (decreasing the
    desired response). Some drugs may act as an antagonist in
    one part of the body but as an agonist in another part.</p>
<h2>Kinetics of drug delivery and elimination</h2>
<p>When taking a single dose of a drug orally, its concentration
    will initially increase and then decrease over time. This
    behaviour is shown in the graph in Figure 4.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The concentration profile of a
        drug after a single oral dose (blue trace), plotted as
        a function of time.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>C<sub>max</sub> is the maximum concentration the drug achieves
    in the body. It achieves this concentration at a time t<sub>max</sub>.
    C<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>max</sub> depend on how quickly
    the drug enters the body, and then how quickly it is eliminated.
    The total area under the curve is a measure of the total
    systemic exposure to the drug. The curve of the graph before
    the peak gives information about how quickly the drug enters
    the systemic circulation. The area under the curve up to
    C<sub>max</sub> is therefore a measure of early exposure
    to the drug in the body. The graph in Figure 4 shows the
    change in concentration with time typical for an orally administered
    drug. Other methods of administration will have different
    concentration profiles. For example, for intravenous administration
    the drug is delivered directly to the bloodstream, and so
    the concentration of the drug starts at the maximum and then
    decays over time (see Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The concentration profile of a
        drug after a single intravenous dose (purple trace),
        plotted as a function of time.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Different drugs have different kinetics of elimination. They
    can either be eliminated by a first order process (see Figure
    6, left graph) or by a zero order process (see Figure 6,
    right graph).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The kinetics of elimination of
        a drug from the body. Left graph: concentration plotted
        as a function of time for a first order process. Right
        graph: concentration plotted as a function of time for
        a zero order process</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For most drugs and most methods of administration, elimination
    from the body follows first order kinetics. This means that
    a <i>constant fraction</i> of the drug present will be eliminated
    in a unit of time. Thus, the concentration of the drug in
    the body decreases logarithmically over time: the <i>rate of elimination</i>    is proportional to the drug concentration, and the amount
    of drug removed per unit time will vary in direct proportion
    to the drug concentration. Most drugs follow first order
    elimination kinetics because generally therapeutic drug concentrations
    are not sufficiently high to saturate (one of the steps in)
    the elimination mechanism. Only once the elimination mechanism
    is saturated will zero order kinetics apply.</p>
<p>For an elimination process according to zero order kinetics,
    the concentration of the drug in the body decreases linearly
    over time: the <i>rate of elimination</i> is independent
    of the drug concentration, a constant amount of the drug
    is eliminated in a unit of time.</p>
<p>An example of a zero order elimination drug is ethanol (alcohol).
    The first metabolising step in the <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol elimination process is oxidation to acetaldehyde</a>    and the corresponding enzyme is rapidly saturated, even at
    low alcohol concentrations. It is straightforward to calculate
    the amount of alcohol in the blood, based on this zero order
    elimination process. Alcohol breathalysers exploit these
    kinetic data. As the blood travels around the body, it picks
    up alcohol that you have been drinking. When the blood then
    goes into the lungs, a small representative proportion of
    alcohol gets passed from the blood into the lungs via gaseous
    exchange (similar to carbon dioxide in normal breathing).
    The concentration of alcohol in the blood that evaporates
    into breath directly depends on the concentration of alcohol
    in the body. The blood to breath ratio of alcohol is not
    constant, varying both with the individual and over time.
    However, it remains constant enough for the British Government
    to use a blood to breath ratio of 2,300 : 1. This means that
    the concentration of alcohol in the blood is 2300 times that
    of the concentration in the breath. This small proportion
    of alcohol in breath, together with some of these individual
    differences, are the reason for compulsory blood alcohol
    tests when you are caught driving under the influence of
    alcohol. The breathalyser test alone is not sufficiently
    accurate to determine exact alcohol levels in the body.</p>
<p>Figure 7 (first order kinetics) and Figure 8 (zero order kinetics)
    show how the rate of elimination can be expressed in terms
    of the half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of the drug. The half-life
    is the time taken for 50% of the drug to be eliminated from
    the body.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Half-life, t1/2, of drug elimination
        for first order processes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Half-life, t1/2, of drug elimination
        for zero order processes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Alternatively, the elimination kinetics of a drug can be expressed
    as a rate constant, k. The rate constant is the fraction
    of the drug eliminated per time unit. Zero or first order
    characteristics of drug elimination processes have large
    effects on t<sub>1/2</sub> and k.</p>
<p>For some drugs, the elimination kinetics are more complicated
    and are dose / concentration dependent. This means that as
    the concentration increases, the half-life of the drug will
    also increase. This will result in the concentration of the
    drug increasing disproportionally with increases in dose.
    This, in turn will eventually result in the elimination rate
    becoming independent of the concentration.</p>
<p>For drugs that are rapidly absorbed, a short t<sub>1/2</sub>    may cause the concentration to fall below the minimum effective
    concentration between doses unless the dose is large or the
    intervals are short. If the dose is large, the peak concentration
    may exceed the maximum safe concentration. Avoidance of toxicity
    and maintenance of a steady effect are easier to achieve
    with drugs for which t<sub>1/2</sub> is relatively long.
    Sometimes it is desirable to attain a particular drug effect
    rapidly. This may make it necessary to give a so called loading
    dose. A loading dose is larger than the usual maintenance
    dose.</p>
<h2>Drug Variability</h2>
<p>The probability of being able to achieve effective therapy without
    the patient experiencing harmful effects is a measure of
    the drugs therapeutic utility. For a drug to be therapeutically
    useful, this probability must ideally be in excess of 50
    %. For an individual drug, a decision must be made as to
    what extent the beneficial effects of the drug outweigh its
    adverse effect. The decision will be very dependent on both
    the drug and the condition being treated.</p>
<p>For different people taking the same drug there can be significant
    variability in both the desired and adverse effects. For
    the same drug people will have therapeutic windows of different
    locations and widths. The therapeutic index of a drug reflects
    a ratio of the blood concentration at which the drug is toxic,
    and the concentration at which the drug is effective. To
    be safe, drugs need as high a therapeutic index as possible.
    Different reactions of different people to the same drug
    can lead to some people having either an intolerance or an
    allergic reaction to a drug that other people are fine with.
    Whether a person is intolerant, allergic or has no response
    to a drug depends on the person’s genetics.</p>
<p>Variability between people can occur in both the drugs pharmacokinetics
    and the drugs pharmacodynamics, with the magnitude and relative
    contribution of each being dependent on the drug. There are
    many reasons that can explain why different people will respond
    differently to the same drug, including age, body weight,
    disease, comorbidities and other drugs that are simultaneously
    being taken. Generally the average dosing regimen will need
    to be modified to whether it is being given to a child, an
    adult or a senior. Gender can have some effect on variability,
    but generally this effect is very small (with the noticeable
    exception of alcohol).</p>
<p>Another major reason for variability is related to inheritance
    and genetics. However, this is highly unpredictable, especially
    for the pharmacodynamics involved. Reactions due to genetic
    disposition however will remain the same for a person’s lifetime.
    Differences in a person’s genetic structure can affect the
    way their body will absorb, distribute, metabolise and excrete
    a drug.</p>
<p>Differences can also result from an individual completely lacking
    a target receptor, causing the person to completely fail
    to respond to a drug. The sensitivity of a receptor to a
    drug can also vary between people, resulting in different
    drug responses.</p>
<p>The study of the effect that genetics has on drug response is
    called pharmacogenetics. This branch of pharmacological research
    is increasingly important, with more and more biologically
    derived and ‘personalised’ medications being developed.</p>
<h1 id="different-medicinal-drug-preparations">Different medicinal drug preparations</h1>
<p>Before any of the considerations about dosage and timings of
    drugs, different delivery modes, therapeutic windows, drug
    interactions and so on, are of any relevance, there is a
    long and hard journey for any ‘aspiring substance’ to become
    a useful and useable medicinal drug. Only very few candidate
    molecules make it from the designer stage in the laboratory
    (or more precisely: nowadays usually in a computer algorithm
    before ever entering a real laboratory) to any trial stages,
    let alone to the market in the form of a licensed drug.</p>
<p>Of course, there are all the obvious considerations that a substance
    must have the desired effect without too many serious side
    effects, it must be safe to produce and to store, it must
    be economically viable to make and distribute it; the list
    is long. Before any such practical considerations may play
    a role, there are a handful of fundamental properties that
    are crucial for a substance to be (or become) a useful drug,
    or not.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the mode of delivery of a drug (orally, or by
    injection) or its purpose, there is one essential property
    that determines its potential usefulness and bioavailability:
    its solubility. The majority of medicinal drugs are small
    to medium-sized organic molecules, the majority of these
    are solid at room and body temperature. For these molecules
    to reach their target site(s) in the body, they have to be
    soluble in water as well as in some less polar environments
    (such as fat and some other body fluids). If the compound
    is liquid under normal conditions, it still has to be miscible
    with the various relevant body fluids. In addition to the
    transport of drug molecules to their target site being dependent
    on their solubility properties, sufficient solubility at
    the target site is a requirement to achieve the necessary
    concentration of a drug at its site of action.</p>
<p>Solubility in different solvents is a fundamental property of
    each individual chemical substance. Solubility of medicinal
    drug compounds in water is so important for their function
    that medicinal drugs for oral use are commonly classified
    according to their solubility / permeability in the digestive
    system. Poor water solubility causes limited absorption,
    poor distribution in body tissues and poor metabolism characteristics.</p>
<p>Many organic substances in the solid state display a phenomenon
    called polymorphism: they tend to crystallise in different
    forms (see Figure 9 for an illustration) under ever so slightly
    different conditions.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure9.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Two different, polymorphic, crystalline
        forms of the same substance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The substance will be perfectly chemically pure (and chemically
    identical) in both crystalline forms, but because the two
    crystalline forms A and B have different geometric mutual
    arrangements (symmetries, to be precise), they will have
    different physical properties and only one of (sometimes
    many) the polymorphs will be thermodynamically stable. The
    other forms will, over time and given opportunity, eventually
    convert to this stable form. One of the physical properties
    depending on the crystalline form is solubility. Often, the
    most stable form is less soluble than some other polymorphs.
    However, some of the more soluble, less stable polymorphs
    may not be possible to maintain through the manufacture process,
    or may end up with a very short shelf life.</p>
<p>Preparing pure crystalline forms is a labour-intensive process
    and usually requires following a narrowly defined (and multiply
    tested) protocol. It involves all kinds of basic or sophisticated
    isolation and crystallisation techniques.</p>
<p>Figure 10 illustrates one of the possible production failures
    that may occur if not enough time is allowed for crystals
    to form, or if the growing conditions for crystallisation
    (concentration, temperature, purity of solvent, and so on)
    are not stable enough.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Top: a completely disordered,
        amorphous powder; bottom: a partially order solid with
        just some islands of local, short-range ordered crystallites.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Under such circumstances a completely disordered, amorphous material
    may be obtained (Figure 10 top), or a so called partially
    ordered solid (powder) material is obtained (Figure 10 bottom;
    glasses belong to this category of partially ordered solid
    material). Partially ordered solids / glasses are sometimes
    thought of being a frozen snapshot version of the short-
    and medium-range order of a liquid. Again, these non-crystalline
    versions will have different properties from the crystalline
    varieties of the same chemical compound. Because of the lack
    of order, their properties will be fairly ill-defined and
    therefore, these forms are obviously unsuitable for medicinal
    drug use.</p>
<p>Another general trend displayed by many crystalline organic molecules
    is that their crystal structures are not particularly tightly
    packed, there may be spaces between molecules. This can have
    major implications for the suitability of a compound as a
    medicinal drug. Figure 11 illustrates this general property
    of many organic crystalline solids.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed/figure11.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Top: an ordered, crystalline
        structure that includes some (disorderly) water or other
        solvent molecules; bottom: an ordered, crystalline structure
        where individual molecular units trap solvent molecules
        in hollow intra-molecular spaces.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Empty spaces are there to be filled. From an energetic and structural
    point of view, it is attractive for many loosely held together
    solid-state structures of organic molecules to incorporate
    some solvent or water molecules. This may well increase the
    stability of the solid compound as these incorporated molecules
    help to hold the structure together. Another possibility
    is that solvent molecules might get trapped inside some hollow
    space of individual molecules and get encapsulated in that
    way. In either case, this is an unwanted effect as far as
    preparation of medicinal drugs is concerned. After dissolving
    the solid material, the trapped solvent molecules will be
    set free. If the trapped solvent molecules from the synthesis
    procedures happen to be toxic organic solvent molecules,
    this is obviously not wanted. One could argue that if the
    trapped solvent molecules are water molecules, it should
    not matter in terms of setting a toxic component free. While
    that is true, very rarely are these inclusions in any way
    controlled in terms of composition. That, again, leads to
    ill-defined and varying properties of different batches of
    preparation and rules out such compounds as suitable medicinal
    drug candidates.</p>
<p>Accordingly, pharmaceutical companies are obliged to follow tight
    regulatory processes and protocols to monitor their production
    lines. Having said all that, it is probably not surprising
    to hear that despite all these efforts, there are regularly
    reports about clinical failures of some (generic and otherwise)
    drug preparations. It takes very little to change the behaviour
    and properties of a medicinal drug – it could be very minor
    effects, such as a slightly different grain size of inert
    filler molecules to dilute and bulk up the active drug to
    pill size. Better understanding and property control of organic
    compounds in the solid state is therefore a prime research
    topic in all pharmaceutical industries. It is also fair to
    say that if you notice that the supposedly identical drug
    from company A does not work for you in the same way as the
    one manufactured by company B, this is likely not your imagination
    but a fact.</p>
<p>Given that organic molecules tend to be slightly temperamental
    and not as stable as a rock, some of the instructions you
    may find on the packaging of some of your prescribed (or
    over-the-counter) medication perhaps makes more sense:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Best before dates for medicinal drugs (other than for supermarket-bought
        food) do make good sense: these are conservative estimates
        of periods of time over which it is highly unlikely that
        the drug preparation will have changed structurally.</li>
    <li>If it is required to keep a drug at low temperatures – this
        is either necessary to give the active form of a compound
        enough shelf life, or it is necessary because otherwise
        the active ingredient may chemically decompose.</li>
    <li>Most drugs are packaged such that they are protected from
        sunlight, in brown glass bottles or aluminium blister
        packs to exclude UV light. This is often necessary to
        prevent structural or chemical decomposition. Not only
        elevated temperatures do damage organic molecules, UV
        light can cause damage too (to organic molecules in pills
        just as to the organic molecules making up human bodies).</li>
    <li>Many drugs are packaged in individual one-pill compartments
        such that the pill only gets exposed to the air right
        before using it. Protection from moisture or oxygen in
        the air is often necessary to prevent decomposition of
        drug preparations (either the active ingredient or the
        filler compounds, or both).</li>
    <li>Some drugs are not pressed into a pill but are contained
        as powders in some kind of capsules. This might be necessary
        to prevent decomposition of a drug by stomach acid and
        to shuttle it safely to the intestines from where the
        active drug can then be absorbed by the body. Another
        reason might be that there is no way to press an active
        drug into a pill: applying pressure does alter the crystal
        structure of many organic molecules.</li>
    <li>If you purchase the same drug on the same day in two different
        forms as, say pills and in liquid form, you may notice
        that the quoted shelf life of the liquid (solution) preparation
        is typically shorter than that quoted for the solid preparation.
        This reflects another general property of organic compounds:
        they tend to be less stable once dissolved.</li>
    <li>Please dispose of unused drugs by returning them to your
        nearest pharmacy: many chemical substances used as medicinal
        drugs are harmful to the environment; your pharmacy will
        properly dispose of them.</li>
