<p>Enamel, the top layer of the components that make up teeth, is
    the hardest, mineralised substance in the body (predominantly
    made from hydroxyapatite). The enamel layer of teeth does
    not contain living cells, in contrast to the other hard (cementum
    and dentine) and soft (pulp) dental components. Hence cracks
    or chips of the enamel layer do not heal and damage to the
    enamel layer is permanent.</p>
<p>Despite being protected by the hard enamel layer, teeth can crack,
    chip and break. Such damage can be caused by biting on something
    hard, by accidents such as falling on the face, by other
    impact such as being hit in the face, by cavities from
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a> or from general neglect of extensive old
        fillings.</p>
<p>A broken or chipped tooth may or may not be painful but a sharp
    broken surface is likely to irritate or hurt the tongue and/or
    other soft tissue in the mouth. A broken tooth is more likely
    to be painful if the pulp (containing the nerve of the tooth)
    is damaged or the (innervated) dentine layer of the tooth
    is exposed.</p>
