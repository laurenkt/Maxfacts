<p>The placement and retention in functional use of both <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">craniofacial implants</a>    often involves quite detailed treatment planning.</p>
<p>There may, therefore be several visits for both <a href="/diagnosis/tests">investigations</a>    and conversation with both the person who places the implants
    and the person who will make the superstructure and final
    prosthesis (they may not be the same person, although with
    dental implants performed by a restorative or general dentist,
    they may).</p>
<p>Once treatment starts there may be a period of <a href="/treatment/surgery/preprosthetic-surgery">preparation of the site</a>    where the dental implant(s) are to be placed. Once the bone
    and gum of the recipient site is ready, the implant is prepared
    and inserted, for <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implants</a>    as well as for <a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">craniofacial implants</a>.</p>
<p>Craniofacial implants, which can act as a <a href="/treatment/surgery/implants/getting-started">support for ear, eye and nose prosthesis</a>    are inserted in the same way as dental implants but the lengths
    are relatively much shorter – they are an aid to retention
    of the prosthesis and do not have to stand up to the burden
    of masticatory (chewing) forces.</p>
<p>Most often, a dental implant is covered in gum and left for 4
    to 6 months to achieve osseointegration. There are exceptions
    and in cases of traumatic <a href="/diagnosis-list-missing-teeth">complete avulsion of a tooth</a>    which is lost and cannot be replanted, or immediate atraumatic
    extraction of an anterior tooth, immediate dental implants
    are sometime used.</p>
<p>After this 6 month period the implant is ready to be loaded and
    the various aspects of crown or superstructure are prepared
    by taking impressions. The final product should be available
    after a few weeks.</p>
<p>Implant survival is also measured as being functional after 5
    years so regular follow up by the restorative or general
    dentist in the case of dental implants, or the maxillofacial
    prosthetist in the case of craniofacial implants, is usual.</p>
<p>Extremely high levels of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral and implant hygiene</a>    are essential. Various tactics can be used to address
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants/detailed">peri-implantitis</a> should this develop. This includes standard
        approaches for dealing with <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal disease</a>        for dental implant.  </p>
<p>Less conventional techniques, such as mucosal grafting around
    skin may be needed for craniofacial implants as this performs
    a much better tight epithelial attachment around the implant.
    All craniofacial implants are inserted through skin. Skin
    is much more loose than mucosa. When the connection between
    the osseointegrated implant and the superstructure is created,
    a major weak point is the tightness of the epithelial cuff
    around the emergence point of the implant – healthy mucosa
    is much better than healthy skin. So if inflammation around
    a craniofacial implant occurs, one solution is to excise
    the skin and replace it with grafted mucosa.</p>
