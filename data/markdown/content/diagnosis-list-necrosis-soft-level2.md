<p>Below we discuss the following three topics in a little more
    detail:</p>
<ul>
    <li>how cell death by necrosis differs from the regular and ‘programmed’
        cell death (apoptosis) that is an essential component
        of the normal body regeneration;</li>
    <li>how apoptosis and necrosis relate to each other;</li>
    <li>soft tissue necrosis conditions of particular relevance in
        the maxillofacial region.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="necrosis-and-apoptosis-processes">Necrosis and apoptosis - processes</h1>
<p>Both necrosis and apoptosis refer to series of events leading
    to cell death. The apoptosis pathway follows a genetically
    encoded, internal program for cell renewal and tissue regeneration.
    It is a healthy process in a living body and is sometimes
    called programmed cell death. When cells divide in the regeneration
    process to produce new cells (mitosis), older cells are replaced
    and have to be removed. This process of change goes on in
    the body all the time in all tissues. Apoptosis is also involved
    in the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">healing process</a>    and at various stages in the development of a foetus (for
    example, the fingers of a foetus develop from an early primitive
    form of a hand by apoptosis to separate the fingers from
    each other).</p>
<p>In contrast, the necrosis pathway is triggered by external factors
    such as trauma or infection and leads to damage to, and destruction
    of, tissues. The main mechanistic difference between the
    necrosis and apoptosis pathways is the absence of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>    in the apoptosis process. The two processes are illustrated
    schematically in Figure 1.</p>

        the apoptosis pathway.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During apoptosis, a cell starts reorganising its contents and
    its surface in an orderly fashion. Bubble-like structures
    develop on the surface and the functional units (organelles)
    in the cell get broken down into their components. The cell
    starts to shrink and the broken-down units are wrapped in
    individual membrane layers and get released. The process
    releases some messenger chemicals that attract specialised
    white blood cells (phagocytes) which consequently engulf
    the broken-down cell units. Most of the components get recycled
    in the body, for example to produce new proteins. Similar,
    extremely efficient recycling loops are found everywhere
    in nature.</p>
<p>Necrosis of a cell is triggered by some external event, by injury
    or infection. The cell starts swelling and may form bubble-like
    structures on the surface, the interior cell components rapidly
    fail to function. Eventually the cell membrane ruptures and
    releases the cell’s contents to the intercellular space.
    This includes chemicals that harm neighbouring cells and
    cause <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>.
    The necrosis process does not release messenger chemicals
    that attract phagocytes, so the necrotic debris does not
    get cleaned up. Accordingly, necrosis can rapidly spread
    through tissue (and, in fact, throughout the body). Extensive
    tissue damage caused by necrosis is also part of the destruction
    caused by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a>.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms trigger the necrotic pathway: loss of energy supply
    to a cell (lacking blood or oxygen supply), or direct damage
    to the cell membrane. Depending on the cause, the manifestations
    of soft tissue necrosis can take different forms:</p>
<ul>
    <li>liquefactive necrosis is typically caused by bacterial or
        fungal infections, the dead tissue is liquefied (‘pus’);</li>
    <li>coagulative necrosis is typically caused by hindered circulation
        (most common in the heart muscle, after an infarction);</li>
    <li>gaseous necrosis is a combination of liquefactive and coagulative
        necrosis; it is typically caused by bacteria (gas gangrene,
        caused by <i>clostridium</i> infection), some mycobacterial
        (tuberculosis) or fungal infections;</li>
    <li>fat necrosis only affects fatty tissue (most common in severe
        inflammation of the pancreas);</li>
    <li>fibrinoid necrosis blocks the arteries and is caused be deposits
        of fibrin (insoluble protein involved in blood clotting)
        and antigens / antibodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Necrosis can affect all tissues, soft tissues as well as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">hard tissues (bone)</a>.
    The basic principles are the same for all types of tissues,
    even if the life cycles and regeneration mechanisms of bones
    are slightly different from those of soft tissues. The most
    common cause for bone necrosis is failure of oxygen, glucose
    and water delivery at a cellular level which is most easily
    understood as a compromised blood supply of one form or another.</p>
<h1 id="necrosis-and-apoptosis--a-few-general-remarks">Necrosis and apoptosis – a few general remarks</h1>
<p>Our discussion of apoptosis and necrosis has painted a binary
    picture of two unrelated, different processes. The reality
    is, as usual, less black-and-white but more nuanced. It
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">has been said</a> that apoptosis and necrosis are likely
        just the two extreme ends of a scale, where less severe
        injury or infection may lead to apoptosis and more severe
        events may trigger the necrosis pathway. For example,
        a minor burn will cause a small blister and heal quickly,
        whereas a major burn will trigger necrosis. Where exactly
        on such a scale cell-death events fall also depends on
        the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">host’s immune system</a>        and there are large variations between individuals.</p>
<p>There are further connections between the two pathways. For example,
    if the debris from the apoptosis processes is not removed
    swiftly enough, apoptosis may be followed by necrosis (post-apoptotic
    necrosis). Such border-crossing of the two processes is thought
    to be of importance in <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">autoimmune disorders</a>.
     </p>
<p>Subdividing apoptosis and necrosis into ‘always beneficial’ (apoptosis)
    and ‘always harmful’ (necrosis) categories is an oversimplification.
    It is true that almost always necrosis has harmful effects
    but there may be few special circumstances where necrosis
    is an overall non-harmful component of wound healing. More
    importantly, one should acknowledge the vast number of apoptotic
    events that keep living bodies in balance and regenerated
    every day, and that these processes are entirely beneficial
    and healthy (and go unnoticed in everyday life). This is
    true as long as the rate of apoptosis remains in harmony
    with its task in tissue regeneration. However, if too few
    or too many apoptopic processes occur, this process becomes
    a contributing factor in disease. Too high a rate of apoptosis
    is thought to play an important role in autoimmune diseases
    such as Parkinson’s disease or various forms of muscular
    dystrophy where too many nerve or muscle cells die prematurely.
    On the other hand, if in a community of tissue cells there
    are too few apoptopic events, this will usually lead to the
    growth of tumours, which then may turn into malignant growths
    (one of the key features of malignant cells is the absence
    of a regular apoptopic process in their cell cycle, leading
    to uncontrolled growth).</p>

<h2>Oral mucosa</h2>
<p>Necrosis of the oral mucosa is most commonly caused by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>,
    can develop from an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>    or from some other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">lesion of the oral mucosa</a>.
    Necrosis of the oral mucosa as an unwanted effect of <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    or especially <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy in the head &amp; neck region</a>    can occur acutely, following on from severe <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">mucositis and ulcers</a>    during treatment periods (see Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-necrosis-soft-level2-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Intraoral view of a necrotic floor
        of mouth after <a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Irradiated mucosa in the mouth remains vulnerable in the long
    term to mechanical injury and thus remains susceptible to
    develop necrosis. Necrosis of the oral mucosa after radiotherapy
    may lead to, or occur together with, necrosis of irradiated
    jaw and other bones (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteoradionecrosis</a>).</p>
<h2>Skin</h2>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">Infections</a> of the skin,
    including those following <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage/getting-started">trauma</a>,
    in particular extended wounds and bite wounds may be the
    starting point for skin necrosis in the head &amp; neck region.
    Skin in the head &amp; neck region after exposure to <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">high-energy radiation</a>    is susceptible to injury and infection and more vulnerable
    to necrosis than normal skin because of a typically compromised
    blood supply in the irradiated area.</p>
<p>Figure 3 and Figure 4 depict examples of skin necrosis conditions.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-necrosis-soft-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Neck skin completely necrotic
        after <a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>        treatment for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastatic deposits</a>        of laryngeal (voice box) cancer in surrounding skin.</figcaption>

        systemic and skin condition that can be caused by certain
        medications or infections).</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Deeper tissue layers (fascia, muscle)</h2>
<p>As discussed above, the mechanisms of necrotic cell death are
    such that necrosis can rapidly spread through tissue. In
    the maxillofacial region, serious infections or abscesses
    can lead to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess/detailed">necrotising fasciitis</a>    or an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a>,
    both potentially life-threatening conditions.</p>
