<p>Vascular abnormalities cover a diverse range of conditions, with
    regard to the type of lesions and their extent and location(s).
    However, allowing for some variations, the management and
    treatment options for these diverse conditions fall into
    similar categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li>wait &amp; watch and other conservative approaches;</li>
    <li>sclerotherapy (and related);</li>
    <li>surgical interventions, including <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">laser</a>        applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below we describe each of these modalities in more detail. The
    discussion includes brief summaries of vascular abnormalities
    and where relevant the respective treatment modalities.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If youâ€™d like to read more background information about the
        different vascular abnormalities and their identification,
        this is covered on our detailed page about the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">diagnosis of vascular abnormalities</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="wait-and-watch-and-other-conservative-approaches">Wait &amp; watch and other conservative approaches</h1>
<h2>Modalities involved</h2>
<p>Apart from regular surveillance by means of <a href="/diagnosis/tests">various imaging techniques</a>,
    a range of non-invasive treatments, mostly involving drugs,
    characterise this approach to the management of various vascular
    abnormalities. This approach may be the only one necessary
    for the majority of haemangiomas, until these lesions resolve
    by themselves. It may also be the only approach necessary
    for some small and asymptomatic vascular malformations, at
    least for some extended periods of time.</p>
<p>A common issue to deal with is the control <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">of pain</a>    which, for example may occur during the proliferation phase
    of haemangioma, or there may be painful episodes associated
    with localised intra-lesion <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">thrombosis</a>    in venous malformations. For the most part, adequate pain
    control is achieved by readily available over the counter
    analgesics such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, (NSAIDs) and/or paracetamol</a>.
    Pain management in conjunction with arteriovenous malformations
    can be more complicated and may require referral to a pain
    specialist.</p>
<p>The expansion of <strong>venous malformations</strong> in the
    head and neck region may be slowed by preventing extended
    periods of increased (hydrostatic) pressure on the lesion.
    This can be achieved by elevating the head of the bed. The
    management of venous malformations may further include the
    use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/anticoagulant">anticoagulants</a>    (heparin) in order to prevent intra-lesion thromboses. Such
    medication will also be indicated in conjunction with invasive
    treatment schemes (see below). Where relevant, it may be
    advisable to avoid oral contraceptives. Recurrence of thromboses
    in venous malformations is an indication for surgical intervention
    to block the connection between the malformation and nearby
    draining veins (see below).</p>
<p>Conservative management of <strong>lymphatic malformations</strong>    may require the use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial agents</a>    for the prevention and/or treatment of infections. Recurrent
    infections are an indication for invasive intervention (see
    below), surgical or sclerotherapy. Recently, some initial
    promising results have been reported in the treatment of
    lymphatic malformations (less promising for venous and arteriovenous
    malformations) with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. The mTOR
    enzyme complex is the one of the key regulating mechanisms
    in the cell metabolism of mammals. mTOR is essential in the
    cellular synthesis of proteins and it activates a number
    of growth factors, including the growth factor for vascular
    endothelial cells. Sirolimus hinders this enzymatic pathway.
    It also has immunosuppressing properties and its most common
    medical applications are in the prevention of transplant
    rejection after renal (kidney) transplants, and as an
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiangiogenic">antiangiogenic agent</a> in the treatment of some advanced
        malignancies. Sirolimus has been reported to have positive
        effects on some complicated lymphatic malformations that
        had previously not been successfully treated by other
        conventional means and where surgical resection is not
        possible. No complete response of lymphatic malformations
        to sirolimus treatment has been reported, though. Furthermore,
        there is no information yet about optimum administration
        schemes (duration and dosage) or any long-term results
        and potential adverse effects. However, no opportunistic
        infections under sirolimus treatment have been reported
        to date.</p>
<p>Conservative management schemes for <strong>haemangioma</strong>    depend on the phase of the haemangioma development (infantile
    haemangioma - absent or small at birth; congenital haemangioma
    - large at birth), and whether it is about to resolve itself
    over time (which most of these lesions do). A small haemangioma
    in an uncomplicated location may not require any intervention
    initially (or later on). In fact, it may take several months
    after birth for an infantile haemangioma to be identified.</p>
<p>It is important to realise that 30 to 50 % of haemangioma have
    a precursor which within weeks of birth becomes obvious and
    proliferates faster than the growth of the infant, reaching
    around 80 % of its maximum size by five months. This is the
    early proliferation phase which is followed by a slower late
    proliferation phase. Involution usually begins around one
    year of age. Awareness of this natural history is essential
    to the conservative management of these lesions.</p>
<p>Complications that mandate interventions are haemorrhage and
    ulcerations. Ulcerations that typically require treatment
    with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>    are common with haemangiomas of the lip, ear and neck. Where
    haemangioma involves the airway, eye or oral cavity, treatment
    needs to ensure that vital functions are not impaired. The
    traditional approach to managing such lesions (that is to
    attempt shrinkage) was the use of systemic and/or local (injected
    into the lesion) <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-steroid">corticosteroids</a>.
    In particular large lesions may require systemic application
    of these agents which, despite their adverse effects, have
    been successful. In some other cases of haemangioma in the
    facial region, early attempts to shrink the lesion may be
    necessary to prevent massive disfigurement. In many cases,
    after involution (shrinkage) of a haemangioma, surgical resection
    of, for example remaining scar tissue is necessary or desirable,
    for functional and cosmetic reasons (see below).</p>
<p>The past 10 years have seen changes in the management of haemangiomas,
    after the accidental discovery that propranolol (a beta-blocker,
    used in the treatment of high blood pressure and other cardiovascular
    and pulmonary conditions) given to infants to treat cardiac
    conditions, leads to rapid regression of haemangiomas. In
    nearly all cases there is an improvement of haemangioma under
    propranolol treatment, with only moderate adverse effects
    reported to date. Propranolol has rapidly replaced corticosteroids
    as the first-line treatment of haemangiomas. The mechanism
    by which propranolol causes regression of haemangioma is
    essentially unknown (but it is speculated that the drug triggers
    apoptosis (cell death) of vascular endothelial cells).</p>
<h1 id="sclerotherapy">Sclerotherapy</h1>
<h2>Modalities involved</h2>
<p>Sclerotherapy aims to damage the endothelium (lining) of a vascular
    malformation. The locally inflicted damage then results in
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>,
    thrombosis (formation of a blood clot) and eventually leads
    to sclerosis / fibrosis (scarring), and shrinkage of the
    lesion. The sclerosing agent, effectively a potent local
    irritant, is injected percutaneously (through the skin) directly
    into the lesion(s), either with a syringe or through a catheter.
    This mode of application usually requires monitoring by some
    imaging methodology, for example real-time <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound screening</a>    in order to ensure that the sclerosing agent is safely delivered
    to the lesion and not to any surrounding vessels and tissues.</p>
<p>A number of different chemicals, with different modes of action,
    are in use for sclerotherapy of vascular malformations in
    the head and neck region. Commonly used sclerosing agents
    are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>absolute ethanol</strong>: a highly effective sclerosing
        agent causing damage to the endothelium (lining of vessels)
        by denaturation of cell proteins; high rate of complications
        including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">skin necrosis</a>        and ulcerations, nerve damage, excessive swelling, pain.
        Recent recommendations discourage its use for the treatment
        of vascular malformations in the head and neck region;</li>
    <li><strong>ethanol gels</strong>: an alternative ethanol preparation,
        reducing adverse effects and making it easier to keep
        the agent in the malformation;</li>
    <li><strong>polidocanol</strong>: a detergent that absorbs onto
        the cell membrane of the endothelium cells, causing disintegration
        of the endothelium and fibrosis inside the vessel and
        obliteration; may be prepared and applied as foam, with
        reported improved effectiveness; Â </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ethanolamine oleate</strong>: an emulsion
                of a fatty acid salt, causing irritation and
                an inflammatory response, followed by fibrosis
                and obliteration of the vessel. In addition,
                it is thought that ethanolamine oleate may also
                activate <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">coagulation</a>                by triggering the release of clotting factors.</li>
            <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bleomycin"><strong>bleomycin</strong></a>                : a substance isolated from a bacterial strand,
                originally intended as an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial agent</a>                but found to be too toxic for this use, owing
                to its cytotoxic properties. Used in <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>                of some malignancies but systemic use carries
                a substantial burden of adverse (pulmonary fibrosis)
                effects. Non-systemic use as a sclerosing agent
                by direct injection into venous or lymphatic
                malformations seems less prone to severe adverse
                effects (at least in the short term). This has
                become the most common application of bleomycin;</li>
            <li><strong>sodium tetradecyl sulfate</strong>: a surfactant
                that acts on lipid molecules of the endothelium
                cells, stripping the lining of the vessel and
                causing a strong inflammatory response and inducing
                enhanced clotting / thrombosis; more effective
                in the treatment of venous malformations than
                lymphatic malformations;</li>
            <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/picibanil"><strong>picibanil (OK-432)</strong></a>                : the general immuno-stimulant properties of
                picibanil cause local <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>                by activating a number of cytokines (messenger
                molecules), sufficient to damage the endothelium
                enough to cause fibrosis. Picibanil has become
                a standard agent for the sclerotherapy of a range
                of lymphatic malformations. The production of
                picibanil involves a stage of treatment of the
                sample with a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">penicillin derivative</a>,
                making picibanil an unsuitable medicinal drug
                for people with penicillin allergy;</li>
            <li><strong>doxycycline</strong>: an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agent</a>                belonging to the class of tetracyclines, known
                to hinder bacterial protein synthesis. It is
                not yet clear how doxycycline acts as a sclerosing
                agent but is thought that the mechanism follows
                similar principles to its properties as an antibacterial
                agent, by impairing the growth of endothelial
                cells. Doxycycline causes fibrin and collagen
                deposits in the vessel, leading to fibrosis and
                obliteration;</li>
            <li><strong>n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA)</strong>: strictly
                speaking, NBCA is not a sclerosing agent but
                acts by creating essentially a plug to block
                pathological communication between arteries and
                veins in arteriovenous malformations (sometimes
                referred to as embolotherapy). NBCA is a strong
                and fast-acting adhesive with favourable mechanical
                properties (tensile strength). It is otherwise
                used as a medicinal glue to close surgical wounds
                and other skin lacerations, and to <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">stop bleeding</a>                (haemostasis). At room temperature NBCA is a
                low-viscosity monomer which rapidly and irreversibly
                polymerises on contact with moisture and negatively
                charged ions. Thus, injection into a blood vessel
                and exposure to blood will immediately produce
                a polymeric plug at the site of release, the
                injected liquid will follow the blood flow. The
                main drawbacks of NBCA application hence are
                a lack of control over the exact site(s) of delivery,
                and an inherent risk that the catheter tip used
                to deliver the chemical to the lesion may get
                accidentally glued to the vessel wall.</li>
            <li><strong>ethylene-vinyl-alcohol copolymer (EVOH)</strong>:
                another polymeric embolising agent used to treat
                arteriovenous malformations. EVOH is not an adhesive
                but still forms a plug when injected into a blood
                vessel. EVOH is a liquid at room temperature
                as long as it is saturated with the organic solvents
                dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). When injected into
                a blood vessel, the local DMSO concentration
                is reduced and solid polymeric EVOH forms. The
                polymerisation rate is slower than with NBCA,
                thus allowing better control over delivery site(s)
                and penetration into deeper areas of malformations.
                Disadvantages of the use of EVOH as an embolising
                agent are the yet unknown long-term stability
                and effects of the plugs. In addition, EVOH injection
                is very painful and will usually have to be carried
                out under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>.
                EVOH is, however, the current favourite for intra-arterial
                embolisation.</li>

<h2>Typical situations of head &amp; neck vascular abnormalities
    managed by sclerotherapy / embolotherapy</h2>
<p>Arteriovenous malformations are one of the classical lesions
    where obliteration of the â€˜nidusâ€™ (the main shunt between
    the arterial pressure side and the venous side) by embolisation
    has revolutionised treatment. This is followed by complete
    excision where possible.</p>
<h1 id="surgical-interventions">Surgical interventions</h1>
<p>Surgical excision of these lesions is required in up to half
    of haemagiomata (Figure 1) and most other vascular abnormalities
    (usually after embolisation).</p>

        facial nerve; bottom left: excised lesion with facial
        nerve preserved and residual parotid-gland tissue; bottom
        right: excised specimen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The surgery follows standard site-specific anatomical dissection
    with preservation of vital structures (Figure 2).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Top: pyogenic granuloma of the
        palate; bottom: excised specimen showing properties characteristic
        of a high-flow malformation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In haemagioma, lesions are very rarely interfered with during
    the proliferative or involuting phase for obvious reasons.
    Excision of the final involuted lesion is relatively straightforward
    and follows <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">standard facial aesthetic techniques</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">Laser photocoagulation</a>    (usually with a 595 mm pulsed dye laser) is usually done
    in the later stages and aims to reduce or eliminate residual
    staining.</p>
<p>Examples of surgical treatment of macrocystic (Figure 3 and Figure
    4) and microcystic lymphangiomata (Figure 5) highlight the
    importance of preserving functional anatomical structures
    where possible.</p>

<p>Significant surgery may be required to completely resect arteriovenous
    malformations and large high- and low-flow venous malformations.
    The general aim is to limit destruction caused by the continuous
    growth of lesions. Early operation on well-localised lesions
    which have not been previously interfered with have the highest
    chance of recurrence-free complete excision, minimal complications
    and overall success.</p>
