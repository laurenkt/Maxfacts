<p>This section takes a slightly closer look at, and gives an overview
    of, the three main categories of bone lesions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>inflammatory and other non-neoplastic lesions (including
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bone infections</a>)</li>
    <li>benign neoplastic lesions (benign lumps)</li>
    <li>malignant neoplastic lesions (bone cancers).</li>
</ul>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about specific information about
        these conditions, this information is on our detailed
        page about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/detailed">bone lesions</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="inflammatory-and-other-non-neoplastic-bone-lesions">Inflammatory and other non-neoplastic bone lesions</h1>
<p>Inflammatory conditions of the jaws are a puzzling and difficult
    to manage group of conditions that do not fall into any particular
    or easy category. Other non-neoplastic bone lesions are an
    equally puzzling group of hereditary and acquired conditions.</p>
<h2>Dry Socket</h2>
<p>Pain after breakdown of the healing blood clot following tooth
    extraction is by far the most common inflammatory bone lesion
    in the head and neck region. Even this common condition has
    excited a fair amount of controversy.</p>
<p>This condition has a number of different names and it occurs
    in approximately 3 % of routine tooth extractions, and up
    to 20 % of surgical tooth extractions. Figure 1 shows a dry
    socket, Figure 2 shows the radiograph of a severe case of
    dry socket.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-bone-lesion-level2-figure1.jpg">

        (bone inflammation) of the tooth socket.</figcaption>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Radiograph of a severe case of
        dry socket, leading to sequestration (formation of a
        dead piece of bone).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The pain is localised to the site of extraction, is often throbbing
    and very severe. It will often keep you awake at night. The
    classical description is of a toothache that never went away
    when the tooth was removed. Some dry sockets may start after
    the tooth has been removed and the pain does not commence
    until the healing blood clot has completely broken down and
    established bone inflammation has started. Some patients
    benefit from the use of standard <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</a>    (such as ibuprofen), but the pain can often be so severe
    that these analgesics do not really help.</p>
<h2>Osteomyelitis</h2>
<p>The term osteomyelitis covers a range of acute and chronic inflammatory
    bone conditions that usually originate from some kind of
    bacterial infection. It starts in the medullary space (central
    cavity of bones, where the bone marrow is located) and progresses
    as inflammatory changes in the nutrient (blood) vessels render
    the bone ischaemic (suffering from insufficient blood flow).
    Any pus formed can compress the vessels further. As a consequence,
    the bone becomes necrotic (the bone tissue is dying) and
    behaves like a foreign body, known as a sequestrum. This
    gives rise to a chronic inflammatory reaction as the body
    tries to eliminate the sequestrum. Continued attempts at
    repair may result in the sequestrum becoming encased in bone
    material, known as involucrum.</p>
<p>Imaging may be difficult because the radiographic findings lag
    behind the clinical stage. The first radiographic sign (see
    Figure 3) may be radiopacity which represents the sequestrum
    that has lost its non-mineralised components. Bone scans
    (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/pet-scans">PET scans</a>) show
    osteomyelitis as areas of increased bone turnover (‘hot spots’).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-bone-lesion-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Chronic osteomyelitis of the right
        mandible. Note the loss of the right condyle (part of
        the mandible forming the jaw joint) and the diffuse radiopacity
        of the right body of the mandible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Osteomyelitis can be divided into suppurative (producing pus)
    or non-suppurative (not producing pus) forms, although these
    two forms may overlap considerably. There is frequently a
    predisposing factor for the development of osteomyelitis.
    This may be some underlying systemic disease (such as an
    autoimmune disorder) or local bony factors. The local bony
    factors include primary diseases of bone, such as fibrous
    dysplasia, Paget’s disease or osteopetrosis (for these conditions,
    see below). Osteomyelitis may also be secondary to bone damage
    from trauma or foreign bodies in the bone, such as bone plates.</p>
<p>In the maxillofacial region, osteomyelitis is most commonly seen
    in the mandible (lower jaw) and is usually secondary to an
    odontogenic (tooth related) infection. Rarely, in infants
    there may be an acute infection of the maxilla (upper jaw).
    This is more correctly known as osteitis as the medullary
    space (where osteomyelitis commonly develops) in the maxilla
    is negligible. Instead, the infection is thought to reach
    the maxilla <i>via</i> the blood stream (a haematogenous
    route). The infection is most commonly poly-microbial (caused
    by several types of microorganisms) with <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">staphylococci</a>    predominating. Salmonella is commonly implicated in those
    cases of osteomyelitis occurring in patients with sickle
    cell disease (a disorder of the red blood cells).</p>
<p>Infection is not the only possible cause of necrosis of bone.
    Cells in bone exposed to high-energy radiation during
    <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> will have suffered DNA damage and will break
        down when required to undergo replication (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">osteoradionecrosis, ORN</a>).
        This necrotic bone is very susceptible to secondary infection.</p>
<p>Some <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">medicinal drugs</a>    used to treat / manage osteoporosis (brittle bones) or
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">bone metastases</a> (bisphosphonates, anti-angiogenic drugs
        and anti-rank ligand antibodies (denosumab, a human monoclonal
        antibody), respectively) render bone incapable of normal
        physiological healing by reducing the activity of bone
        renewal. In this situation bone is also very prone to
        superinfection. As the bone cannot respond to infection,
        this can give rise to a specific, drug-related kind of
        osteomyelitis.</p>
<p>Both types of drugs, bisphosphonates and anti-rank ligand antibodies,
    hinder the osteoclasts (the cells that break down old bone
    tissue, before osteoblasts start regenerating bone by producing
    new material); anti-rank ligand antibodies effectively paralyse
    osteoclasts. This drug-related kind of osteomyelitis is usually
    referred to as medication related osteonecrosis of the jaws
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">(MRONJ)</a>.</p>
<p>Some anti-angiogenic drugs (drugs hindering or preventing the
    formation of blood vessels; used in some cancer treatment
    schemes alongside more <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">traditional chemotherapy</a>)
    can cause a very similar condition.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Osteonecrosis can be a debilitating condition. If you would
        like to read more about osteonecrosis, there is much
        more information in our section about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteonecrosis</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h2>Cysts</h2>
<p>Cysts are pathological cavities that are lined with epithelium
    (the kind of tissue that covers the body’s various surfaces)
    and are filled with fluid, air or semi-solids. A wide variety
    of cysts of different origins occur in the head and neck
    region, in particular the jaws, including some fluid-filled
    cavities in bone that are not lined by epithelium (so called
    pseudo-cysts).</p>
<aside>
    <p>Given that cysts are such a common condition affecting the
        head and neck area, in particular the jaws, we have a
        separate section describing cysts, the many <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">different varieties of cysts</a>        as well as the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/detailed">origins and features of cysts</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h2>Fibrous dysplasia</h2>
<p>This is characteristically a disease of young adults in which
    areas of bone are replaced by fibrous (scar-like) tissue.
    Onset is in childhood and the disease tends to stabilise
    with age. Fibrous dysplasia weakens the affected bone(s)
    and can lead to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a>,
    deformity (dysplasia), pain and loss of functions, depending
    on location(s).</p>
<p>Jaw involvement usually manifests as a hard, painless swelling
    with a characteristic radiograph appearance of ‘ground glass’
    (see Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-bone-lesion-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Radiographic appearance of fibrous
        dysplasia of the maxilla (upper jaw).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">Histology</a> shows
    fibrous replacement of bone with osseous trabeculae (spongy
    bone structure) that look like Chinese characters. It is
    thought that fibrous dysplasia may be caused by a non-hereditary
    genetic mutation that occurs at the early embryonal development
    stage for unknown reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Cherubism</strong> is a hereditary variant of fibrous
    dysplasia that manifests between 2 and 4 years of age. It
    appears bilaterally within the maxilla and/or mandible, causing
    expansion of the jaw bones and swelling of the face; in severe
    cases functional impairment may result. Cherubism tends to
    burn out in a similar fashion to fibrous dysplasia with age.</p>
<p><strong>Ossifying fibroma</strong> is probably a localised variant
    of fibrous dysplasia that appears clinically as a bony hard
    mass in the jaws. It is capable of enlarging both bony cortices
    (the hard outer layer of bone) and appears well circumscribed
    radiologically.</p>
<h2>Osteopetrosis</h2>
<p>Osteopetrosis (marble bone disease) is a hereditary bone disorder
    that causes bones to harden and densify, leading to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a>,
    deformity (dysplasia), pain and loss of functions, depending
    on location(s). Despite the hardening and deposition of excessive
    bony material, affected bones are prone to fractures.</p>
<p>It is thought that dysfunction of the osteoclasts (cells responsible
    for breaking down worn bone cells in the bone remodelling
    process) is responsible for the disease. The resulting osteosclerosis
    (abnormal hardness and density of bone) can result from a
    number of different causes, not just osteopetrosis and thus
    requires careful investigations to support the diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Paget’s disease of the bone</h2>
<p>This multisystem condition affects the skull, pelvis and long
    bones as well as the jaws. In the northern hemisphere it
    is relatively common after the age of 55 years. A number
    of virus infections have been indicated as causes of the
    condition, although this correlation is unclear. There may
    be genetic hereditary factors and some involvement of vitamin
    D has also been suggested but ultimately the cause of Paget’s
    disease is not yet known.</p>
<p>Paget’s disease of the bone is an imbalance in the bone remodelling
    process. Initial excessive break-down of bone tissue by overactive
    large osteoclasts (osteolysis) is followed by reactive chaotic
    increased production of bone tissue. This replacement of
    the normal bone remodelling process by a chaotic alternation
    of resorption and deposition leads to weakened, distorted
    bones (see Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-bone-lesion-level2-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Example of the distortion of the
        left zygoma (cheek bone) and skull in Paget’s disease
        of the bone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bone pain and cranial neuropathies (malfunction and impairments
    of nerves in the skull) can occur, there may be altered sensation
    of the face in the affected region. Plain <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray</a>    images show a cotton wool appearance of the affected bone;
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood and urine tests</a>    show elevated levels of some characteristic markers (alkaline
    phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline). Rarely Paget’s disease
    of the bone develops to a primary bone malignancy (osteosarcoma;
    see below).</p>
<h1 id="benign-neoplastic-bone-lesions-benign-bone-tumours">Benign neoplastic bone lesions (benign bone tumours)</h1>
<p>The majority of bone tumours are benign. Some are lesions that
    can occur in soft or hard tissues (or both) whereas others
    are specific to bone tissue,</p>
<p>In the absence of any convincing, technical ordering principle
    for these kinds of lesions, we resort to listing these conditions
    in alphabetical order.</p>
<h2>Ameloblastoma</h2>
<p>This is the most common tumour of dental epithelial origin. It
    is found particularly in the posterior mandible in African
    males. Ameloblastoma is a benign tumour and has three clinical
    and histological variants – unicystic, follicular/plexiform
    and peripheral.</p>
<p><strong>Unicystic ameloblastoma</strong> is a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cystic</a>    swelling distinguished by resorbing adjacent tooth roots:
    histologically the lesion is an ameloblastoma but it has
    predominantly fluid contents. Figure 4 shows an example.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-bone-lesion-level2-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Unicystic amelobastoma resorbing
        tooth roots.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Follicular/plexiform ameloblastoma</strong> is a solid
    tumour, again found in the mandible. It is more aggressive
    in its clinical behaviour and resembles a solid tumour histologically
    (see Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-bone-lesion-level2-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Sectional dental panoramic tomogram
        of the ‘soap bubble’ appearance of the solid variety
        of ameloblastoma.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Peripheral ameloblastoma</strong> is an extraosseous
    soft tissue version of ameloblastoma. It is rare and is more
    often seen in the maxilla.</p>
<p>Ameloblastic carcinoma is a malignant version of ameloblastoma,
    other odontogenic benign tumours (adenomyoblastoma, myxoma,
    ameloblastic fibroma) are extremely rare.</p>
<h2>Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (Nora’s lesion)</h2>
<p>Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (Nora’s lesion;
    after the clinician Nora who first described the condition)
    is a rare benign bone tumour. It affects the cartilage and
    surface (cortex and periosteum) tissues of bones and usually
    afflicts the small bones in hands and feet of young adults,
    less commonly it is observed in the skull bones including
    the jaws. It is a generally painful, rapidly growing tumour;
    it is unknown what causes this lesion. Because of the typically
    rapid and locally aggressive growth, it is important to distinguish
    this lesion from malignant bone tumours such as osteosarcoma
    or chondrosarcoma (see below). This distinction is usually
    achieved by obtaining a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>.
    Depending on the location and size of the lesion it can cause
    signs and symptoms of compressing nerves in the vicinity.</p>
<h2>Giant cell granuloma of bone</h2>
<p>Giant cell granuloma is a benign lesion that can affect <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/benign-lump/detailed">soft tissues</a>    as well as hard tissue. In bone, giant cell granuloma can
    manifest as an intrabony swelling.</p>
<h2>Osteochondroma</h2>
<p>An osteochondroma is a benign bone lesion, originating from cartilage
    and producing an outgrowth (exostosis) on the bone surface.
    Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumour; its
    most common locations are the long bones in the legs, the
    pelvis and the shoulder blade. Osteochondroma can occur as
    a single lesion (the majority of cases) or as multiple lesions;
    it mostly affects young adults.</p>
<h2>Osteoma / Gardner’s syndrome</h2>
<p>An osteoma is a mature benign bony growth with the most common
    locations being the skull bones, the mandible and the paranasal
    sinus (spaces surrounding the nasal cavity). The cause is
    not known. Osteoma may appear as a single lesion (see Figure
    8)  </p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-bone-lesion-level2-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Three-dimensional <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scan</a>        reconstructed representation of a large mandibular osteoma.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>or as small multiple bony protuberances. These are characteristic
    of Gardner’s syndrome. Gardner’s syndrome is a genetic disorder
    (multiple familial polyposis coli) which usually causes multiple
    benign tumours to form in different organs, particularly
    the colon. Gardner’s syndrome is thought to carry an increased
    risk of developing colorectal malignancies in the long term.</p>
<h2>Torus</h2>
<p>A torus is a bony exostosis (outgrowth) of the jaw. Torus palatinus
    occurs in the centre of the hard palate (see Figure 9), torus
    mandibularis occurs in the lingual (tongue-side) premolar
    or molar region of the mandible (see Figure 10). These lesions
    are entirely benign and only require removal when they are
    symptomatic or for reasons of prosthetic functionality.</p>

</figure>
<h1 id="malignant-neoplastic-bone-lesions-bone-cancers">Malignant neoplastic bone lesions (bone cancers)</h1>
<p>Most primary malignant neoplastic bone lesions belong to the
    sarcoma category: a sarcoma is a malignant growth that originates
    from cells that were formed from the mesenchyme, a connective
    tissue that is present during foetal development. Much of
    the musculoskeletal system (cancellous bone, cartilage, fat
    and muscles) develops from this foetal tissue. Carcinoma
    refers to a malignant growth that arises from epithelial
    cells (cells in the tissues that line the surfaces and cavities
    of the body and its organs).</p>
<p>Primary malignant bone lesions are rare whereas <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>    (secondary malignant growths from other primary malignancies)
    originating from more common cancers (breast, prostate and
    lung cancers in particular) show a tendency to affect bones.</p>
<aside>
    <p>Secondary malignancies, including bone metastases, either
        originating from head and neck cancers, or originating
        from cancers elsewhere in the body and affecting the
        head and neck region, are discussed in our section on
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>A number of primary malignant bone lesions are typically malignancies
    of children and young adults but can occur at all ages. Generally,
    the head and neck region is not the most common location
    of most primary (and secondary) malignant bone lesions.</p>
<h2>Some primary malignant bone lesions relevant in the head &amp;
    neck region</h2>
<p><strong>Osteosarcoma</strong> is <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histologically</a>    the most common form of primary malignant bone lesions, mostly
    affecting young adults (because it tends to occur in growing
    bones) with the most common locations around knee and hip,
    but is also observed in the jaw. Osteosarcoma tends to be
    an aggressive, fast growing (high grade) malignancy with
    a tendency of forming <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>    (spreading).</p>
<p><strong>Osteogenic sarcoma in cystic cavities</strong> is a rare
    variant of osteosarcoma. It is mostly composed of blood-filled
    cystic spaces and necrotic (dead) tumour tissue, leads to
    severe bone destruction and has a tendency to form <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>    mostly in the lungs, similar to osteosarcoma. It is thought
    that osteogenic sarcoma growth is so fast that local growth
    of blood supply vessels cannot keep up; part of the tumour
    hence dies, forming characteristic blood-filled cystic cavities
    and necrotic tissue in the process. This type of malignant
    bone lesion can sometimes appear similar to the changes observed
    for a benign lesion, an <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">aneurysmal bone cyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing sarcoma</strong> is the second most common primary
    malignant bone lesion mostly afflicting children and young
    adults. It originates from the inner cavity of bones (the
    medullary space) and, similar to osteosarcoma, causes severe
    bone destruction alongside inflammation of the periosteum
    (dense connective tissue enveloping bones), and has a propensity
    to form <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>.
    Ewing sarcoma only rarely occurs in the skull and facial
    bones.</p>
<p><strong>Chondrosarcoma</strong> is a malignant bone lesion that
    originates from cartilage tissue; about a third of malignant
    bone lesions of the skeleton belong to this category. Whereas
    most other primary malignant bone lesions tend to afflict
    mostly younger people, chondrosarcoma occurs at all ages.</p>
