<p>Xerostomia (dry mouth) is not a disease but a symptom, and yet
    we have included it in the A-Z of diagnoses as a separate
    entry. This is for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>it is a common problem affecting an estimated 10 to 30 %
        of the population and is related to a variety of underlying
        conditions, the most common cause being medications;</li>
    <li>if severe xerostomia persists for extended periods of time,
        it can lead to further oral and systemic health issues
        (including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>        (difficulty swallowing);</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> applied
        to the head &amp; neck region can cause severe and lasting
        xerostomia;</li>
    <li>autoimmune disorders such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">Sjögren’s syndrome</a>        cause particularly severe and lasting forms of xerostomia,
        with significant negative impact on quality of life and
        general health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xerostomia is by definition a symptom and thus subjective in
    nature. Patients are likely to approach clinicians with complaints
    of a constantly dry mouth that doesn’t go away with drinking
    water. Diagnosing dry mouth by measuring the resting salivary
    flow is difficult as the pre-complaint flow rate is often
    unknown. Normal salivary flow rates vary widely so dry mouth
    cannot be excluded if subjects have a flow rate in the normal
    range. However, extremely xerostomic patients may have flows
    of less than 0.1 ml/min (measured over 5 minutes). Persistent
    dry mouth can cause noticeable effects on the mouth and these
    have been calibrated in the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">Challacombe scale</a>    which can be useful in charting the severity and progression
    of dry mouth.</p>
<p>Below we give an overview of the various causes of xerostomia:
    medications, diseases and high-energy radiation. In the majority
    of cases the cause(s) for dry-mouth problems can be identified
    but there is a minority of cases where no specific cause
    can be firmly established (idiopathic xerostomia).</p>
<h1 id="xerostomia-and-medications">Xerostomia and medications</h1>
<p>Several hundred prescription and non-prescription medications
    are known to cause or exacerbate xerostomia, indeed over
    50 % of all medications list dry mouth as a possible side-effect.
    These include some of the most common <a href="/treatment/other/medication">prescription drugs</a>    such as antidepressants, analgesics, antihistamines and anti-hypertensives,
    cytotoxic drugs used in <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>,
    as well as recreational drugs such as <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/overview">caffeine, cocaine or nicotine</a>    and commonly used over-the-counter herbal remedies (for example,
    gingko and capsicum extracts or St. John’s wort preparations).
    There are different mechanisms by which medications cause
    dry mouth problems, affecting both the quantity and composition
    of saliva. Medications potentially responsible for causing
    or exacerbating xerostomia should be identifiable from recording
    a thorough <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>.</p>
<p>The severity of dry-mouth problems are usually related to the
    dose of medications and number of different medications (polypharmacy).
    Sometimes the duration of usage can also affect dry mouth.
    Dry mouth related to medications usually has a rapid change
    and is therefore more noticeable. Fortunately, in most cases
    medication-related xerostomia is a temporary and a reversible
    symptom once the medication is no longer taken.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which <strong>cytotoxic drugs</strong> cause
    xerostomia as an unwanted side-effect of <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    by damaging the cells in salivary gland tissue are broadly
    the same mechanisms by which these substances damage or destroy
    malignant cells, in addition to the indirect effects on salivary
    glands by damage to the mucosa (lining) of the mouth commonly
    caused by cytotoxic drugs.</p>
<p>Drugs that are prescribed to deplete fluids from the body (<strong>diuretics</strong>)
    can lead to xerostomia by reducing the salivation rate, similar
    to the effects of dehydration from insufficient fluid intake
    (common in elderly people, or with excessive exercise) or
    fever. This occurs because of the effect of diuretics on
    the concentration of electrolytes in body fluids, which in
    turn is closely related to the fluids ‘management’ of the
    body.</p>
<p>It may seem surprising that so many widely used drugs, in particular
    <strong>anticholinergic and sympathomimetic drugs</strong>    (see below and Table 1) cause dry-mouth problems. Many drugs
    are used to ‘normalise’ or ‘regulate’ involuntary body functions
    such as blood pressure or heart rate. Many drugs achieve
    these effects by directly interfering with the autonomic
    nervous system that governs all involuntary body functions,
    including salivation; other drugs have indirect effects on
    the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>Of the three strands of the autonomic nervous system, mainly
    the parasympathetic and the sympathetic sub-systems matter
    here in this context. These two, in part complementary, sub-systems
    of the autonomic nervous system are sometimes referred to
    as the ‘rest and digest’ or ‘feed and breed’ system (parasympathetic
    system) and the ‘fight or flight’ (sympathetic) system. The
    cooperation between these two strands of the autonomic nervous
    systems is governed by specialised centres in a particular
    region of the brain (the medulla oblongata).</p>
<p>The parasympathetic nervous system is involved in the regulation
    of sexual arousal, secretion from various glands (salivation
    and lacrimation), digestive functions and the slowing of
    the heart rate. Its main neurotransmitter (messenger molecule)
    is acetylcholine (ACh) which binds to muscarinic receptors
    that are found all over the body. Anticholinergic drugs competitively
    inhibit this binding of the neurotransmitter molecule ACh
    to its target receptors both centrally in the brain and peripherally
    in salivary glands to cause reduced salivation.</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system is mainly involved in the regulation
    of the requirements of fast body action – ‘fight and flight’
    (but in addition it also controls and stabilises various
    physiological activities in order to maintain a stable equilibrium
    for the body’s functions (homeostasis) under all circumstances).
    Its actions include the increase of heart rate and blood
    pressure, constriction of blood vessels and activation of
    the sweat glands. When activated, neurons release the relevant
    messenger molecules (dopamine, norepinephrine or epinephrine),
    these bind to their target receptors where they initiate
    the various ‘fight and flight’ physiological effects. Drugs
    that mimic the actions of the sympathetic nervous system
    are called sympathomimetics, others that inhibit adrenergic
    receptors are often called blockers eg beta blockers (beta
    adrenergic antagonists); both of these can act either centrally
    or peripherally to cause hyposalivation and therefore dry
    mouth.</p>
<p>Table 1 gives some examples of drugs known to cause dry-mouth
    problems, there are <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">many more drugs with such side effects</a>.</p>

<h1 id="xerostomia-and-diseases">Xerostomia and diseases</h1>
<p>As well as a wide range of medications, several diseases are
    associated with xerostomia of different degrees of severity.
    Autoimmune conditions and diabetes mellitus are the most
    common among these diseases. Identifying and confirming a
    particular disease or disorder as the cause of dry-mouth
    problems usually requires some detective work and may involve
    a variety of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/urine-tests">urine</a> tests,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microbiological laboratory investigations</a>    or taking a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>.
    Depending on the suspected cause(s), some <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a> or
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> imaging may be included in the diagnostic toolbox.</p>
<h2>Endocrine diseases</h2>
<p><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> (type 1and type 2) results
    in hyperglycaemia (enhanced glucose levels in the blood and
    other body fluids) and concomitant changes in metabolism.
    Type 1 diabetes is caused by insufficient or absent insulin
    production and belongs to the broad category of autoimmune
    diseases (see below). Type 2 diabetes is related to insulin
    resistance and has a strong element of behavioural (poor
    diet and life style) and environmental risk factors. Xerostomia
    is commonly reported for untreated or poorly treated diabetes
    where it occurs alongside polyuria (increased volume of urine
    output, due to glucose in the urine (osmotic diuresis)) which
    leads to dehydration. In fact, xerostomia is often the symptom
    which leads to a diabetes diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Thyroiditis</strong> is the umbrella term for inflammatory
    disorders of the thyroid gland that lead to reduced activity
    of the gland. The most common types of thyroiditis belong
    to the broad category of autoimmune diseases (see below)
    but there are also medication- or radiation-related disorders
    of the thyroid gland. Thyroiditis commonly occurs in conjunction
    with other autoimmune conditions such as Sjögren’s syndrome
    (see below). Inflammation of the thyroid gland is often associated
    with xerostomia.</p>
<h2>Viral and bacterial infections</h2>
<p>Oral lesions of all kinds as well as xerostomia commonly occur
    in <strong>human immunodeficiency virus</strong> (HIV) infections,
    with xerostomia related both to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antiviral medications</a>    and structural changes of the salivary gland tissues as a
    consequence of the infection.</p>
<p>Infections with <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong>, <strong>hepatitis C virus</strong>,
    <strong>cytomegalovirus</strong> and <strong>T-lymphotropic virus (type 1)</strong>    have all been implicated with xerostomia in some way. However,
    these findings about cause and effect are not entirely clear
    as it appears more likely that all of these viral infections
    in some way are related to and/or cause or trigger autoimmune
    diseases (cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus: Sjögren’s
    syndrome; Epstein-Barr virus: a whole host of autoimmune
    disorders) or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">T-cell leukaemia</a>    in adults (T-lymphotropic virus), where all of these conditions
    have a very well established role in causing xerostomia.</p>
<p><strong>Bacterial infections</strong> that affect the salivary
    glands can cause reduced salivary gland activity. Organisms
    include  <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">mycobacterium</a>    and actinomycosis (caused by an anaerobic bacterium, <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">actinomyces</a>    as well as much more common oral pathogens such as s<i>treptococci</i>    species</p>
<h2>Nutritional causes</h2>
<p>The most obvious condition here is <strong>dehydration</strong>,
    common in elderly people but insufficient fluid intake is
    not restricted to this demographic. Dehydration can also
    occur in the course of intense exercise, or can be induced
    by medications (diuretics, see above) or be related to swallowing
    difficulties, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>    (difficulty swallowing liquids is a common form of dysphagia).</p>
<p><strong>Eating disorders</strong> such as anorexia nervosa (avoiding
    eating) and bulimia nervosa (binge eating and induced vomiting)
    cause a range of metabolic disturbances. These, together
    with the effects of abuse of diuretics and laxatives (see
    above) associated with eating disorders, explain why eating
    disorders are often associated with xerostomia.</p>
<h2>Neurological conditions</h2>
<p>The central nervous system, including the brain, controls the
    autonomic nervous system (see above), which in turn is responsible
    for the regulation of salivation, amongst many other body
    functions. Accordingly, <strong>brain trauma</strong> from
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures of facial bones</a>,
    from surgical interventions or from stroke may all cause
    dry-mouth problems.</p>
<p>Paralysis of the facial nerve, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started"><strong>Bell’s palsy</strong></a>,
    is usually a temporary condition of unknown cause(s). One
    of the functions of the facial nerve is to carry parasympathetic
    information to the salivary glands, so an impaired facial
    nerve leads to reduced function of the salivary glands. Bell’s
    palsy can occur in conjunction with a number of other conditions,
    including autoimmune diseases (see below), diabetes (see
    above) or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">herpes zoster viral infection</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Parkinson’s disease</strong> is a neurodegenerative disease
    of unknown cause. It mainly afflicts older people. The most
    prominent symptoms are various motor dysfunctions but reduced
    function of the salivary glands is also common with this
    condition (in part this is related to medication used to
    treat Parkinson’s disease; see above and Table 1). Excessive
    drooling is a feature of later stages due to loss of control
    of swallowing muscles.</p>
<h2>Autoimmune diseases</h2>
<p>Autoimmune diseases include a group of nearly 100 syndromes and
    conditions, mostly of unknown cause(s), where the body’s
    immune system attacks and often destroys, healthy body tissues.
    The usual trio blamed for autoimmune conditions are genetic
    disposition, environment and some infections. Often several
    of these autoimmune syndromes and conditions (with similar
    symptoms) occur simultaneously, women are more often affected
    than men.</p>
<p><strong>Sjögren’s syndrome</strong> is one of the autoimmune
    disorders for which the precise aetiology (cause) is not
    known although infection by the Epstein-Barr virus has been
    implicated in the development of the disorder. Sjögren’s
    syndrome is not a rare condition, it affects about half as
    many people as rheumatoid arthritis does. Sjögren’s syndrome
    is characterised primarily by a dry mouth and dry eyes. It
    occurs most commonly in middle or old age, with women being
    affected ten times as often as men. When dry mouth and eyes
    occur in isolation it is termed primary Sjögren’s syndrome.
    When these symptoms occur in combination with a connective
    tissue disease it is termed secondary Sjögren’s syndrome.
    It is of interest that the ocular (eye) and oral (mouth)
    symptoms are usually more severe in primary Sjögren’s syndrome.
    The most commonly associated connective tissue diseases are
    rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (see
    below). Of those patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 15 %
    report symptoms consistent with secondary Sjögren’s syndrome;
    for those with systemic lupus erythematosis the figure is
    30 %.</p>
<aside>
    <p>The internationally accepted classification of Sjögren’s
        syndrome together with the diagnostic algorithm for the
        identification of primary and secondary Sjögren’s syndrome
        can be found in our <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">detailed page about salivary gland problems</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>A particular type of white blood cell, the lymphocytes, is crucial
    for the body’s <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune system</a>.
    Lymphocyte T cells, produced in the thymus (a small gland
    at the base of the neck), and lymphocyte B cells, made in
    the bone marrow recognise and identify invaders, foreign
    pathogens such as bacteria or viruses, and trigger an immune
    response to eliminate the pathogen. Some sub-species of T
    cells (the T helper cells) are responsible for triggering
    a direct immune response to invaders while other T cells
    produce enzymes that kill infected body cells.</p>
<p>In Sjögren’s syndrome the salivary (and lacrimal) glands are
    infiltrated by T and B lymphocyte cells. Initially the infiltration
    is focussed around blood vessels or ducts, but increasingly
    over time the whole gland tissue becomes affected. The mistaken
    attack of these T and B cells and the resulting inflammation
    have been said to be mainly responsible for irreversible
    destruction and loss of functioning salivary gland tissue.
    However, clinical observations and laboratory research suggest
    that straightforward inflammatory response of the gland tissues
    is likely to be not the only cause for reduced saliva production.
    The various specific roles of several types of T helper cells,
    as well as the presence of particular antibodies have been
    further investigated, and there are some indications that
    immune-system mediated destruction of muscarinic receptors
    (see above; anticholinergic medications) leads to reduced
    parasympathetic function and thus further reduced salivary
    flow. These searches for causes and mechanisms have not yet
    identified a particular aetiology; genetics, hormones, environmental
    factors, and viral and bacterial infections have all not
    been ruled out. However, recent research suggests the exploration
    of promising routes for <a href="/treatment/surgery/xerostomia">future treatments</a>    of this (and similar) autoimmune disorders. The rare malignant
    transformation of B cells is thought to be responsible for
    the increased risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other">non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a>    in people diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> is a systemic chronic inflammatory
    disease of unknown cause(s); it affects an estimated 1 %
    of the world population (with a three-fold higher incidence
    in women than in men). The inflammation mainly affects the
    lining of multiple joints, primarily small joints in the
    hands and feet. In rare cases rheumatoid arthritis affects
    the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">temporomandibular joint</a>    (jaw joint). Dry-mouth problems are commonly reported in
    about 50 % of rheumatoid arthritis cases. About a third of
    rheumatoid arthritis cases occur together with Sjögren’s
    syndrome (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Systemic lupus erythematosus</strong> is an umbrella
    term for a range of systemic chronic inflammatory diseases
    which affect women more commonly than men. Systemic lupus
    erythematosus causes inflammation of joints, skin, kidneys
    and other body parts, including the oral mucosa (lining of
    the mouth). The majority of patients with this condition
    report problems associated with sore mouth and xerostomia.
    The condition leads to reduced salivary flow as well as to
    changes in the <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">composition of saliva</a>.
    About a third of systemic lupus erythematosus cases occur
    together with Sjögren’s syndrome (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Scleroderma</strong> is a progressive disease leading
    to excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and other
    organs. Oral manifestations of the condition include fibrosis
    (scarring) of the ducts of the salivary glands, alongside
    destruction of the saliva-producing cells in the glands.
    The condition is more common in women than in men. In the
    majority of cases there is severe xerostomia, in about 20
    % of scleroderma cases the condition occurs together with
    Sjögren’s syndrome (see above).</p>
<p><strong>Primary biliary cirrhosis</strong> is an autoimmune inflammatory
    liver disease of unknown cause(s) and frequently occurs together
    with other autoimmune conditions. Reduced salivary flow is
    commonly reported for this condition.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous Conditions</h2>
<p>The cause(s) of <strong>sarcoidosis</strong> are unknown. It
    is an inflammatory disease that leads to the presence of
    multiple granulomas (small areas of inflamed tissue) most
    commonly in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes and salivary
    glands. The condition may be without symptoms and resolve
    spontaneously. However, in some cases where the salivary
    glands are involved, over time some of the saliva-producing
    cells may be lost, resulting in dry-mouth problems. The condition
    is more prevalent in women than in men.</p>
<p><strong>Cystic fibrosis</strong> is a genetic disease that mainly
    affects the function of lungs, pancreas and liver; the condition
    leads to malfunction of secretions. This may include reduced
    quantity and altered quality of saliva secretion, often exacerbated
    by the side effects of medications used in the treatment
    of cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>The ectoderm is the outer tissue layer of the early embryo. <strong>Ectodermal dysplasias</strong>    are inherited disorders that affect body parts and tissues
    that originate from the ectoderm (hair, skin, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/missing-teeth">teeth</a>,
    salivary, lacrimal and sweat glands) when this early period
    of the embryonal development had been disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>Haemochromatosis</strong> is a disorder where abnormally
    large amounts of iron compounds (ferritin) are deposited
    in various organs, such as liver, heart and endocrine glands
    (glands that produce hormones). Deposition in the salivary
    glands leads to reduced salivary flow.</p>
<p><strong>Amyloidosis</strong> describes a range of conditions
    where abnormal protein polymers (amyloid) are deposited in
    a range of organs and tissues, often affecting the tongue,
    thyroid gland, heart, lungs or kidneys, and sometimes leading
    to reduced salivary flow. Amyloidosis conditions often occur
    together with other chronic diseases (secondary amyloidosis).</p>
<p>With <strong>renal disease</strong> in its final stages, irreversible
    loss of kidney function (possibly dialysis), xerostomia is
    often reported. This is related to the accumulation of toxic
    metabolic products in the body as a consequence of renal
    failure, which leads to a severe imbalance of electrolytes.</p>
<p><strong>Graft-versus-host disease</strong> is a serious possible
    complication after a bone marrow or other blood stem cell
    transplant from a genetically different individual. It occurs
    when the donated tissue cells (the graft) recognise the host’s
    cells as foreign and attack these – essentially the graft
    rejects the host. The damage that evolves from this immune
    reaction primarily affects the liver, intestines and oral
    mucosa (lining); chronic forms of graft-versus-host disease
    often include dysfunction of the salivary glands with concomitant
    dry-mouth problems.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/salivary-gland/more-info"><strong>Malignancies of the salivary glands</strong></a>    are rare. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/other">Lymphoma</a>    and some forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">leukaemia</a>    of adults are rare amongst these overall rare salivary gland
    malignancies; they may present with xerostomia as one of
    the early symptoms.</p>

<aside>
    <p>The mechanisms by which high-energy electromagnetic radiation
        damages living cells are described in our detailed page
        about the <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles/detailed">physical principles underpinning radiotherapy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</a> either as
    a single modality or in combination with <a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a>    is a common treatment option for head and neck malignancies.
    Despite improved, more selective irradiation schemes for
    external beam radiotherapy (<a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles/detailed">IMRT</a>)
    and better irradiation planning methods aiming to minimise
    unwanted radiation dose delivered to the salivary glands,
    xerostomia remains a serious long-term consequence of high-energy
    irradiation in the head and neck region (together with
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">osteoradionecrosis</a> and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>).
        More often than not, it is not possible to spare the
        salivary glands (or the mandible) from high-energy irradiation
        to the extent where no or little long-term damage will
        occur. This is mainly because of the anatomical position
        of the glands (and mandible) – often they simply are
        in the way of irradiation aiming at the target volume.
        This is also true when the source of high-energy radiation
        is, for example, a set of implanted radioactive <sup>192</sup>Ir
        wires in <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/application/more-info">brachytherapy (internal radiation source) treatments</a>.</p>
<p>It is commonly accepted that radiotherapy in the head &amp; neck
    region has a number of unwanted and lasting effects on salivary
    glands, oral mucosa, jaw bones and jaw joints, cheek muscles
    and dentition. The extent of all of these effects depend
    on the total dose of radiation delivered to the various tissues,
    the volume of irradiation and the delivery and fractionation
    schemes used (in addition to the <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles/detailed">type of radiation</a>    used).</p>
<p>The typical curative total irradiation dose for a head and neck
    malignancy is 50 to 70 Gy (Gy, gray, is the unit for measuring
    ionising radiation). It is generally accepted that irradiation
    levels of less than 25 Gy delivered to the salivary glands
    in the process lead to little long-term damage and good chances
    of recovery. The peak of salivary-gland damage occurs typically
    around 6 months after radiotherapy, and chemotherapy in addition
    to irradiation is known to exacerbate xerostomia effects.
    It is thought that modulated irradiation schemes (such as
    IMRT) cause slightly less long-term damage to the salivary
    glands than conventional irradiation schemes. It is difficult
    to compare quantitatively such effects as the different schemes
    irradiate different volumes and areas.</p>
<p>It is not completely understood why the salivary glands are so
    vulnerable to the effects of high-energy radiation, and why
    there is little recovery long term once the glands are damaged
    by high-energy radiation. Common wisdom and arguments about
    the curative effects of high-energy radiation rely on the
    idea that cells and tissues with a high rate of turn-over
    and growth (such as malignant cell lines) are more vulnerable
    to the effects of high-energy radiation on DNA. The oral
    mucosa belongs to this group of tissues with fast turn-over.
    Accordingly, the oral mucosa is severely affected by radiotherapy
    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">painful mucositis</a>,
    inflammation of the mucosa, invariably starts soon after
    the beginning of a course of radiotherapy applied to the
    head and neck region. In contrast, the tissues of the salivary
    glands do not have a particularly rapid turn-over rate and
    thus should be less susceptible to radiation damage according
    to this argument. Clearly some additional mechanisms must
    be at work.</p>
<p>The current thinking about the mechanisms underlying the lasting
    damage to the salivary glands caused by high-energy radiation
    favours a two-stage model. There are two distinct forms of
    cell death: <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis">necrosis</a>    and apoptosis. <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles/detailed">DNA damage</a>    from high-energy radiation initiates an inflammatory cell-death
    process, necrosis. Apoptosis is a non-inflammatory, genetically
    rooted cell-death process, sometimes called ‘programmed cell
    death’. It is thought that the initial effects of high-energy
    radiation on the salivary gland tissues, the early destruction
    and loss of saliva-producing cells, are due to apoptosis.
    A later onset of inflammatory tissue response, leading to
    further loss of, and/or damage to salivary-gland tissue is
    thought to be due to necrosis. This model accounts for the
    observed effects over the course of radiotherapy but it does
    not completely explain the lack of long-term recovery of
    the salivary-gland tissues. This lack of recovery is, in
    part, thought to be related to additional damage to ducts
    where the stem/ progenitor cells lie, nerve cells and blood
    vessels in the glands. The two-stage model for the development
    of radiation damage to the salivary glands forms the basis
    for some ideas about and attempts to <a href="/treatment/surgery/xerostomia">prevent radiation-induced xerostomia</a>.</p>
