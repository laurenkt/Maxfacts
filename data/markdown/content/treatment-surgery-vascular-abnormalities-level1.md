<p>Following full <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities">diagnosis</a>    of type, location and extent of a vascular abnormality, the
    most suitable management and treatment options can be discussed.
    There is no one gold-standard treatment scheme for this diverse
    group of conditions, including haemangioma and vascular malformations.
    Typically, several options need to be considered. Broadly
    speaking, vascular malformations are more likely to require
    treatment than haemangioma.</p>
<p>Treatment options include a conservative watch &amp; wait approach,
    surgical interventions of variable degrees of invasiveness,
    including <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">laser treatments</a>,
    and a range of medical treatment schemes (<a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">sclerotherapy</a>).</p>
<h1 id="haemangioma">Haemangioma</h1>
<p>In the majority of cases, a haemangioma does not require any
    treatment other than management by ‘watch and wait’ until
    the lesion resolves by itself, typically around nine years
    of age, by when 90 % of these lesions will have resolved.
    Interventions are only necessary if the lesion is prone to
    ulceration and/or <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">bleeding</a>,
    and/or becomes <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infected</a>,
    or if in the proliferation (growth) phase of the haemangioma
    vital functions (in particular the airway, swallowing, or
    the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">optic nerve</a>)
    are impacted. Very large haemangioma may also warrant early
    intervention to prevent extensive lasting scarring, lasting
    impaired functionality, or even congestive heart failure
    from extremely massive lesions. There are surgical as well
    as medication-based options for treatment, with a range of
    medicinal drugs used to shrink the lesion, <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">sclerotherapy</a>    (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/steroids">steroids</a>    and propranolol). It is estimated that over the ‘life cycle’
    of a haemangioma, in about 25 % of cases at some stage some
    form of intervention is required, most commonly to address
    ulceration.</p>
<h1 id="vascular-malformations">Vascular malformations</h1>
<p>The treatment options for the management of vascular malformations
    vary for the different types and extent of these lesions.</p>
<p>The treatment schemes for <strong>venous malformations</strong>    range from conservative wait &amp; watch approaches for small
    and asymptomatic lesions, to a number of <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">sclerotherapy</a>    options, to surgical excisions, to combinations of treatment
    modalities. Interventions are indicated where venous malformations
    cause <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">pain</a>,
    disfigurement, haemorrhage (severe <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">bleeding</a>),
    increased <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">risk of thrombosis</a>,
    or impact neighbouring structures and their function, such
    as the airway or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">optic nerve</a>.
    Treatment decisions for venous malformations are usually
    guided by location and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">extent of the lesion(s)</a>.</p>
<p>A similar overall picture holds for the treatment modalities
    for <strong>lymphatic malformations</strong>, including conservative
    monitoring schemes, <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">sclerotherapy</a>,
    and/or surgical interventions. Sclerosing agents used in
    the treatment of lymphatic malformations may differ from
    those most commonly used to treat venous malformations. Similarly,
    there may be some differences in the choice of medicinal
    drugs used in a conservative monitoring approach. Choice
    of the most suitable treatment modalities of lymphatic malformations
    not only depends on location and extent of the lesion(s),
    but also on their type and characteristics. Singular (macrocystic)
    lesions tend to be easier to treat by surgical excision and/or
    sclerotherapy than multiple distributed minor (microcystic)
    lesions; the latter may require repeated treatments.</p>
<p>Depending on location and extent of the lesions, the treatment
    of <strong>arteriovenous malformations</strong> by combined
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities/detailed">sclerotherapy</a>    or rather embolization, and surgical interventions can be
    challenging. Surgical resection after sclerotherapy is most
    promising for smaller and localised such lesions. Large arteriovenous
    malformations may also require surgical interventions, especially
    with progressive and invasive behaviour of the lesion and/or
    in the presence of potentially life-threatening haemorrhage
    (bleeding). Extensive resection of such lesions may require
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction with free flaps</a>    and/or other vascular surgery interventions. Curative treatment
    of arteriovenous malformations by complete resection is not
    always possible, repeated sclerotherapy interventions of
    any residual lesions may be necessary postoperatively. Recurrences
    are common after treatment of arteriovenous malformations.</p>
