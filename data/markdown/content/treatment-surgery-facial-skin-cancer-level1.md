<p>Simple treatment of skin cancer is often undertaken by dermatologists
    or by general practitioners / primary care physicians with
    suitable training. Techniques such as <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">cryotherapy</a>    (locally applied extremely low temperatures), curettage (scraping)
    and <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">cautery</a>    (locally applying very high temperature by an electrically
    heated ‘knife’, stops bleeding), <a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>    and local excision will treat the majority of skin tumours
    successfully. Only a small percentage of cases require formal
    surgical excision and reconstruction. The evidence base for
    the best choice curative treatment does, however, support
    surgery.</p>
<p>The overall philosophy for curative treatment by surgery is summarised
    in Figure 1: it involves the complete removal of the lesion,
    with a clear margin if at all possible. For benign lesions
    (top of Figure 1) the margin can be minimal; for malignant
    skin lesions (bottom of Figure 1) the margin needs to be
    more substantial which, in turn, may necessitate <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">repair and reconstruction</a>    for an optimal cosmetic and functional outcome.</p>

<p>Both basal cell carcinoma, BCC, and squamous cell carcinoma,
    SCC, can be successfully treated by radiotherapy or surgery.
    However, the overwhelming preference is for surgery for a
    variety of reasons: aesthetics, speed, tumour bulk and histopathological
    evidence of clearance of the tumour. <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">Radiotherapy</a>    (particularly electron beam) is used as an adjuvant therapy
    after surgery and when surgery is inappropriate for a variety
    of reasons.</p>
