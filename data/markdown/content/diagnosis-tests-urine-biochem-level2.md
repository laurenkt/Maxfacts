<p>Hundreds of waste substances and fluid are excreted from the
    body <i>via</i> the kidneys. Because of this urine tests
    for particular by-products can provide information about
    a wide range of conditions. Occasionally urine tests are
    necessary to complement far more commonly used <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>.
    Frequently urine tests are used to examine kidney function,
    or liver and kidney function(s). This may be part of an assessment
    before starting <a href="/treatment/other/medication">treatment with medications</a>    that are potentially toxic to the kidneys and/or liver, or
    to monitor such treatment schemes.</p>
<p>In the context of an oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic only
    few urine tests are commonly used.</p>
<h1 id="urine-glucose-test">Urine glucose test</h1>
<p>Normally there is no glucose carried in urine. Testing urine
    for glucose used to be the standard screening test for diabetes.
    It is less accurate than the corresponding <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood test</a>    which nowadays is the standard test for diabetes. Under normal
    circumstances glucose is only detected in urine when there
    are very high levels of glucose in the blood, when even healthy
    kidneys cannot filter out the excessive amounts. Therefore
    glucose in urine most commonly indicates untreated diabetes.
    There may, however, be rare kidney conditions where glucose
    is released by the kidneys even if blood glucose levels are
    low or normal (renal glycosuria; a malfunction of the renal
    tubules, part of the filtering components in the kidneys).</p>
<h1 id="24h-urea-and/or-creatinine-urine-test">24h urea and/or creatinine urine test</h1>
<p>This test requires you to collect your urine over a period of
    24h. You may be given a container. The test determines the
    total amount of urea and/or creatinine that is excreted over
    this period of time and normally complements a previous blood
    test [diagnosis-tests-blood-biochem-level3] for urea and/or
    creatinine.</p>
<p>Creatinine is a waste product from muscle metabolism. High levels
    of creatinine may indicate a range of kidney conditions,
    muscular dystrophy or some autoimmune conditions that lead
    to muscle weakening. A diet very high in protein may also
    account for high creatinine levels in urine.</p>
<p>Urea is the main water-soluble waste product from the kidneys
    excreted into urine. Urea is the end product of protein metabolism.
    Abnormal amounts of urea can indicate kidney problems or
    may arise from too high or too low dietary protein intake.</p>
<h1 id="bence-jones-protein">Bence Jones protein</h1>
<p>The Bence Jones protein is not normally found in urine. A urine
    test looking for this protein may follow an <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">immunoglobulin (Ig) blood test</a>    with irregular results.</p>
<p>Presence of the Bence Jones protein, also known as IgM, in urine
    suggests multiple myeloma, a malignancy of the blood plasma
    cells. The neoplastic myeloma plasma cells (mostly in bone
    marrow) produce this particular type of Ig protein, but no
    other functional Igs as would be necessary for a healthy
    immune system. The test is used to diagnose multiple myeloma
    and to monitor the condition, as well as potential kidney
    failure.</p>
<p>High levels of IgM in urine may also be related to a rare form
    of lymphoma, a malignancy of the lymphocytes which then produce
    large quantities of IgM.</p>
