<p>Postoperative problems affecting the pharynx (upper part of the
    throat) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Difficulty in speaking. The upper part of the pharynx includes
        the soft palate. Changes in the shape and function of
        the soft palate can lead to air escaping during speech
        and swallowing. This gives a ‘nasal speech’ and can cause
        regurgitation of liquids through the nose.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">Difficulty in swallowing</a>.
        Narrowing of or interference in the function of the pharynx
        leads to difficulties in the <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">autonomic (not under voluntary control) part of swallowing</a>.
        This is usually worse for liquids. Post-treatment problems
        from <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        are (perhaps surprisingly as the organ is claimed to
        have been ‘preserved’) often much worse because they
        combine an <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">absence of lubrication</a>        (from lack of saliva) with scarring, fibrosis and a profound
        loss of function, often with continuing atrophy (withering
        away) of the functional tissues.</li>
    <li>A sense of sticking in the throat may or may not have an
        anatomical basis. The commonest cause is actually functional
        – regurgitation of stomach and duodenal (from the small
        intestine) fluids to the upper pharynx, which has cells
        lining it which are not suited to exposure to these (acidic)
        fluids.</li>
</ul>
