<h1 id="basal-cell-carcinoma-bcc">Basal cell carcinoma, BCC</h1>
<p>Numerous types of basal cell carcinoma, BCC are described clinically
    and pathologically (nodular, cystic, pigmented, morphoeic
    (infiltrative) and ulcerated) but the most important feature
    is that of margin definition: clearly or ill defined (see
    Figure 1 and Figure 2). The latter are more clinically dangerous
    as infiltration can extend far beyond the visible margins.
     </p>

<p>BCCs very rarely metastasise but will progressively cause local
    damage if neglected. They are called ‘rodent ulcers’ due
    to the progressive gnawing away of tissue. Their rate of
    growth is slow and measured in months and years (see Figure
    3).</p>

<p>BCC is a slow-growing, locally invasive malignant epidermal skin
    tumour predominately affecting white skinned people. Perivascular
    or perineural invasion are features associated with the most
    aggressive forms of BCC. It is the most common cancer in
    Europe.</p>
<p>Aetiological factors appear to be genetic predisposition and
    UV radiation. Increasing age, male sex, fair skin types I
    and II (Fitzpatrick scale; type I always burns and never
    tans, type II usually burns and tans minimally), immunosuppression,
    high fat diet, arsenic exposure are other factors. Multiple
    BCCs are a feature of basal cell naevus syndrome (Gorlin
    syndrome, a rare genetic disorder which, amongst other conditions,
    increases the risk to develop skin cancers). The use of imaging
    techniques such as <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a> scans are indicated
    in cases where bony involvement is suspected or where the
    tumour may have invaded major nerves, the orbit or parotid
    gland. Broadly, the available treatments for BCC can be divided
    into surgical and nonsurgical, with surgical techniques subdivided
    into excision and destruction.</p>
<h1 id="squamous-cell-carcinoma-scc">Squamous cell carcinoma, SCC</h1>
<p>These usually arise in sun-damaged skin, especially of the scalp
    and ear, presenting as a raised nodule, an ulcer with raised
    everted edges or as a fleshy fungating lesion (see Figure
    4).</p>

        ear showing a typical appearance.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clinical differentiation between SCC and BCC is not always easy,
    but with SCC metastasis to the regional lymph nodes occurs
    much more frequently, and their rate of growth is greater
    (see Figure 5).  </p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Squamous cell carcinoma of the
        cheek. Some skin cancers such as this spread to the cervical
        (neck) lymph nodes and require the kind of major ablative
        and reconstructive treatment commonly seen in mucosal
        cancer of the head and neck.</figcaption>

<p>Primary cutaneous SCC is a malignant tumour which may arise from
    the keratinising cells of the epidermis or its appendages.
    It is locally invasive and has the potential to metastasise
    to other organs of the body. Its occurrence is usually related
    to chronic UV light exposure and is therefore especially
    common in people with sun-damaged skin, fair skin, albinism
    and xeroderma pigmentosum (a rare genetic disorder where
    repair of DNA damage caused by UV radiation is impaired;
    in extreme cases all exposure to sunlight becomes impossible
    (‘moon children’)).</p>
<p>Other causes include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ionising radiation</li>
    <li>exposure to arsenic</li>
    <li>pre-existing lesions such as Bowen’s disease (‘SCC <i>in situ</i>’;
        possibly early stage of SCC)</li>
    <li>immunosuppressive drugs (after transplants, inflammatory
        conditions)</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour">lymphoma or leukaemia</a></li>
    <li>human papilloma virus, HPV</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors that influence the metastatic potential of SCC include:
    anatomical site, size, tumour thickness, level of invasion,
    rate of growth, aetiology, degree of histological differentiation
    and host immunosuppression. Topical agents such as imiquimod
    (substance that triggers interferon production in skin cells
    and is thought to help in this way to eliminate malignant
    cells by increased immune response) may have a role in preventing
    the development of skin dysplasia in high-risk renal transplant
    patients. With multiple, frequent or high-risk SCCs, prophylactic
    use of systemic retinoids may be considered.</p>
<p>Kerato-acanthoma is a self-resolving but rapidly developing skin
    lesion which can mimic a SCC as it produces a dome- or volcano-like
    lesion with central ulceration. Although kerato-acanthoma
    will spontaneously resolve, the diagnosis is often very difficult
    and concern over this means accurate histological diagnosis
    is needed and excision is often advisable.</p>
<h1 id="malignant-melanoma">Malignant melanoma</h1>
<p>Malignant melanoma is more common elsewhere on the body, but
    does present on the face and is classified as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>superficial spreading melanoma – the most common type</li>
    <li>nodular melanoma – the most aggressive type (see Figure 6)</li>
    <li>lentigo maligna melanoma – the type most likely to affect
        the face of the elderly</li>
    <li>acral lentiginous melanoma (most common type for people with
        darker skin; often affects palms of hands or soles of
        feet)</li>
    <li>amelanotic melanoma</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>Lentigo maligna is a pigmented patch on the face, which progressively
    enlarges, shows atypia of the melanocytes histologically
    and has the potential to develop into lentigo maligna melanoma.
    Early surgical excision is advised.</p>
