<h1 id="types-of-soft-tissue-injury">Types of soft tissue injury</h1>
<p>Soft tissue injuries may be divided into several types, these
    types being roughly indicative of the mechanism of injury.
    There may be some overlap between types of soft tissue injury
    or they may be found in combination (see Figure1 for an example).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-damage-level3-figure1.jpg">

        wounds, lacerations and implanted foreign bodies caused
        by a high-speed collision with a windscreen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Abrasions</h2>
<p>Abrasions are caused by the force of an object rubbing on the
    surface of the skin. This results in detachment of the epidermis
    (the outer skin layer) and a ‘raw’ flat wound. The epidermis
    may be partially detached, heaping towards one side of the
    wound (following the direction of the blunt force), or totally
    detached leaving a raw surface. Most abrasions will scab
    over and re-epithelialize with minimal scarring provided
    there is no <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">superinfection</a>.</p>
<h2>Contusions</h2>
<p>These are bruises which occur due to rupture of blood vessels
    subcutaneously (under the skin) or deeper within tissue.
    The vessels rupture as a result of blunt trauma, releasing
    small to large amounts of blood into the tissues. The area
    of bruising will invariably be larger than the area of contact
    with the object causing the trauma. There may also be abrasion
    (see above) or laceration (see below) of the skin at the
    site of bruising. Contusions tend to resolve over a varying
    course from weeks to months, depending mainly on the extent
    of release of blood into the tissues. This is obviously influenced
    by drugs (aspirin being the most common) or conditions promoting
    bleeding.</p>
<h2>Lacerations</h2>
<p>These are splits in the skin and underlying tissues due to blunt
    impact, crushing the tissues over a site of bony prominence.
    The blunt trauma causes tearing of the skin, subcutaneous
    and deeper tissues, whilst blood vessels and nerves deeper
    in the wound may stay intact (see Figure 2 for an example).</p>
<p>There may be associated abrasion and contusion injuries (see
    above) at the site of laceration.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Lip laceration demonstrating preservation
        of nerves across the wound.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Incised wounds</h2>
<p>These are ‘clean’ incisions through the skin and deeper tissues,
    caused by a sharp instrument or object such as a knife or
    broken glass. Nerves and blood vessels within incised wounds
    risk being partially or completely severed. Often these wounds
    are the result of an alleged assault, although some neck
    wounds may be self-inflicted. Although it is common to misuse
    the terms ‘laceration’ and ‘incised wound’, it is important
    to understand the practical difference between incised wounds
    and lacerations due to the increased risk of injury to underlying
    vital structures.  </p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Top: a sharp facial wound made
        with a bladed weapon; bottom: beware underlying injuries.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Avulsion</h2>
<p>In an avulsion injury, tissue at the wound site may be displaced
    from the underlying tissue layers yet still partially attached
    (avulsion flap or ‘partial’ avulsion; see Figure 4) or may
    be totally detached from the wound site (complete avulsion).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-damage-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Avulsion-type injuries on the
        face can be viable as long as a vascular pedicle (attached
        tissue piece with blood supply) can be maintained.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Haematoma</h2>
<p>A haematoma is a collection of blood within the soft tissues.
    A volume of blood released into the tissue, with no ‘break’
    in the tissue to allow further escape, may collect to form
    a haematoma. In trauma this usually occurs when a blunt force
    ruptures one or more veins, releasing blood into the tissue
    spaces. The blood release tends to be self-limiting because,
    with no escape route, the tissue is limited in its capacity
    to expand which causes an increase in pressure within the
    collection. The pressure increase may reach the point where
    it compresses the vessel and resists further blood release
    (tamponade). Evacuation of a haematoma, therefore, may carry
    the risk of recommenced haemorrhage (bleeding). Haematomas
    may also form in areas where the tissue layers have been
    separated, creating ‘dead spaces’ for blood to pool. Haematomas,
    being stagnant collections of blood, are at high risk of
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>.</p>
<h2>High Velocity Missile</h2>
<p>Injuries caused by a high velocity object, such as a bullet or
    shrapnel (which may include biological – human – body parts),
    may produce any combination of the above wounds. In some
    cases the damage superficially may appear minimal whereas
    deeper structures have sustained much more damage. In other
    cases, such as a close-proximity shotgun wound, large quantities
    of tissue may have been completely avulsed. In missile injuries
    the degree of damage is very dependent on the energy expenditure
    at impact. Small pellets from a distance at low speed will
    penetrate the skin but cause little underlying damage and
    are often impossible to recover (see Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-damage-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Top: clinical appearance of shotgun
        pellets impacting at low velocity; bottom: radiographic
        appearance of the injury.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Larger pellets (for example high velocity airguns (for which
    a Firearms Certificate is required in the UK)) can penetrate
    significant distance and present an infection risk. Bullets
    create damage directly related to the degree of energy transfer,
    usually associated with composite tissue loss. Contaminated
    shrapnel containing body parts, such as that produced by
    suicide bombers, may also create the risk of microbial contamination
    (particularly hepatitis B or C, HIV or prions (small, infectious
    disease-causing proteins)). High velocity wounds may be self-sterilized
    at the point of departure from the weapon but can introduce
    virulent and unusual contaminants from victims’ clothing
    which can be contaminated to varying degrees (battlefield
    in comparison to civilian). In general, bullets cause tissue
    damage by laceration or crushing, shock waves and cavitation.</p>
<h1 id="assessment-of-wounds">Assessment of wounds</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The key questions to be answered are the following:</p>
<p><strong>How and where did it happen?</strong> The cause of the
    wound must be identified. For example, if caused by a sharp
    object, deeper structures within the wound are more likely
    to be injured. If a weapon has been used, as much information
    about the weapon (including whether or not it broke in use)
    as possible should be obtained. If the wound was caused by
    broken glass, there is reason to suspect that the wound may
    contain fragments of glass (see Figure 6). Human or animal
    bites (or fragmented body parts in the case of explosions)
    indicate a high risk of wound infection, or indeed systemic
    infection (e.g. hepatitis B or C, HIV, rabies).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-damage-level3-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Top: typical windscreen laceration
        injury; also sustained fractures of the zygoma (cheek
        bone) and mandible (lower jaw); bottom: fragments of
        windscreen glass removed from injuries above.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The location of the traumatic event is also important because
    it may provide further information. A wound sustained by
    a cyclist in a road traffic accident may contain gravel.
    A wound contaminated by soil carries an increased risk of
    tetanus (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bacterial infection</a>,
    though rare in the UK because of well-established vaccination
    programme; see below).</p>
<p><strong>When did it happen?</strong> The older the wound, the
    more likely it is to become infected. Wounds that are more
    than 6 hours old are often assumed to be infected.</p>
<p><strong>What is relevant in the medical history?</strong> The
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    will influence the treatment. Whilst a healthy young person
    may be treated uneventfully, a person who is taking <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">warfarin</a>    (an anticoagulant, ‘blood thinner’) will have an increased
    bleeding time, and a patient who is immunocompromised may
    require antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Important points raised in the medical history include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>allergies (Latex, dressings, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotics</a>,
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">anaesthetics</a>        and so on)</li>
    <li>current medication (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous">anticoagulants</a>,
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotics</a>,
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">steroids</a>        and so on)</li>
    <li>complicating medical conditions (diabetes, haemophilia, HIV
        and so on)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tetanus status?</strong> Wounds considered to be prone
    to tetanus infection include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>wounds with evidence of infection</li>
    <li>puncture wounds / stab wounds</li>
    <li>wounds contaminated by dirt / soil (common hosts of tetanus
        bacteria)</li>
    <li>old wounds (&gt; 6 hours)</li>
    <li>wounds with necrotic tissue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Immunisation with tetanus toxoid (+/- tetanus immunoglobulin)
    is required if a patient has not received a tetanus booster
    within 10 years or has never been immunised.</p>
<h2>Clinical Examination</h2>
<h5>Notes should be made of</h5>
<ul>
    <li>the site and type of wound</li>
    <li>the size, shape, and depth of wound</li>
    <li>any tissue loss / avulsion</li>
    <li>the state of deep structures within the wound (nerves, vessels
        and so on)</li>
    <li>the condition of the wound (clean, dirty, infected, areas
        of necrosis and so on).</li>
    <li>the presence or suspected presence of foreign bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>A photograph or diagram can be useful to illustrate type and
    location of wounds; once the wound is photographed it should
    be covered with a sterile dressing and not further exposed
    until formal closure can be performed.</p>
<h2>Special investigations</h2>
<p>For the most part these are limited to <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">plain X-ray radiographs</a>,
    either to exclude underlying <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">bony injury</a>    or the presence of a foreign body. Swabs for culture and
    sensitivity of contaminated or frankly infected wounds are
    probably worthwhile even though treatment will be started
    with ‘best guess’ <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibiotics</a>    right away.</p>
