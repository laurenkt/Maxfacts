<p>are outlined in more detail below. The <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/surgical-endodontics/detailed">following page</a>    discusses some aspects of surgical endodontics related to
    different locations of teeth, revision of surgery, more recent
    developments of potential alternatives, and some additional
    general considerations.</p>
<h1 id="assessment-for-endodontic-surgery">Assessment for endodontic surgery</h1>
<p>A <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination/detailed">clinical examination</a>,
    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiological examination</a>    should be performed when surgical endodontic treatment is
    being considered. Where applicable, previous <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics/more-info">conventional endodontic treatment</a>    (root canal treatment) is also assessed and a decision made
    on its effectiveness. Local anatomical factors, such as the
    proximity of the surgical area to the maxillary sinus (cavity
    above the upper jaw) or neurovascular bundles (important
    nerve and blood vessel structures) need to be taken into
    account, as does the feasibility of surgery. Figure 1 gives
    an example where periapical surgery was the preferable option
    over conventional treatment.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-rest-dentistry-surgical-endodontics-level2-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Left: Lateral perforation of the
        upper left canine (UL3) by a post. This tooth serves
        as a bridge abutment and dismantling the post is therefore
        not the best way forward. Right: Appearance three months
        after surgical endodontic perforation repair. The post
        was left in place because of the significant potential
        for root damage during post removal attempts.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="local-analgesia">Local analgesia</h1>
<p>Most surgical endodontic treatment can be performed under
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local anaesthesia</a> . A careful technique at this stage
        ensures patient comfort throughout the procedure.
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">Topical anaesthetic</a> is applied to a dry mucosa (lining
            of the mouth), followed by a slow supraperiosteal
            injection (local infiltration) of 0.5 ml of the anaesthetic
            solution. Most of the discomfort resulting from the
            administration of local anaesthetic is caused by
            distension of the periosteum (dense layer of connective
            tissue covering bone). Therefore, the remainder of
            the anaesthetic injection is given slowly at a rate
            of approximately 1 ml/minute. In the maxilla (upper
            jaw), infiltrations are almost exclusively used,
            whereas in the mandible (lower jaw) <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">nerve blocks</a>            should be supplemented with local infiltrations.
            <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">Lidocaine</a>            as local anaesthetic with epinephrine (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/adrenaline">adrenaline</a>)
            added in a 1 : 80 000 ratio is commonly used in the
            UK. During surgery, the vasoconstrictive properties
            of adrenaline help with haemostasis (minimising bleeding),
            with keeping the local anaesthetic confined to the
            local region during surgery, and with improving the
            quality and duration of the local analgesia.</p>
<h1 id="incision-and-flaps">Incision and flaps</h1>
<p>A wide variety of flap designs have been used, but the six main
    types are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>semilunar;</li>
    <li>triangular;</li>
    <li>rectangular;</li>
    <li>trapezoid;</li>
    <li>vertical incision;</li>
    <li>Ochsenbein-Lübke flap (not common in Germany, where the distinction
        is made between marginal and para-marginal flaps).</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates the different types of flaps.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-rest-dentistry-surgical-endodontics-level2-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Top left: semilunar flap; top
        right: triangular flap (the vertical relieving incision
        does not bisect the interdental papilla (gum tissue between
        teeth); middle left: rectangular flap; middle right:
        trapezoidal flap; bottom: Ochsenbein-Lübke flap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whichever design is chosen there should be an unobstructed view
    of the operating area and good access for instrumentation.
    The triangular and rectangular flap designs are currently
    the most commonly used. Incision should allow a full thickness
    mucoperiosteal flap to be raised cleanly from the bone. Any
    relieving incisions should be made vertically rather than
    at an angle, and should avoid bulbous areas such as the canine
    prominence in the maxilla where root not covered by bone
    (and therefore having no useful surface blood supply) may
    prevent adequate healing of the flap margin. The flap is
    reflected from crown toward apex, starting in the sulcus,
    and it is kept moist and free of tension. This minimises
    any postoperative problems with gingival recession.</p>
<h1 id="haemostasis">Haemostasis</h1>
<p>Adequate haemostatic control is important during endodontic surgery
    to improve visualisation of the surgical area and thus to
    reduce surgical time and postoperative pain and swelling.
    It also allows the root-end filling (see below) to be placed
    under favourable conditions. The <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/adrenaline">epinephrine</a>    in local anaesthetic solutions can significantly reduce intra-operative
    haemorrhage by acting as a vasoconstrictor [treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-vasoconstrictor-vasodilator]
    in gingival (gum) blood vessels. Solutions with a 1 : 50
    000 epinephrine concentration have been found to cause half
    the blood loss of those with 1 : 80 000 concentration, with
    no significant difference in systemic effects.</p>
<p>The design of the flap is also important when considering haemostatic
    control for endodontic surgery. The supraperiosteal blood
    vessels run parallel to the long axis of the tooth, and therefore
    vertical relieving incisions as opposed to angled ones will
    decrease the number of blood vessels severed. Furthermore,
    reflection of a full thickness periosteal flap which retains
    the microvasculature within the body of the flap also limits
    haemorrhage.</p>
<p>In addition to local anaesthetic solutions containing epinephrine
    and a careful surgical technique, a variety of haemostatic
    agents are available to effect adequate moisture control.
    These are usually used after periapical curettage (see below),
    commonly used haemostatic agents include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cotton/gauze with or without vasoconstrictor - these agents
        reduce haemorrhage by applying physical pressure and
        can be readily impregnated with a vasoconstrictor;</li>
    <li>oxycellulose - these agents provide a framework for <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">clot formation</a>        (there have been reports of a foreign body reaction to
        the material together with delayed healing);</li>
    <li>wax - this exerts a pressure or tamponade effect to aid with
        haemostasis, but histologically a foreign body reaction
        is also shown to be elicited. It can sometimes be difficult
        to remove all of the wax from the bony crypt;</li>
    <li>calcium alginate - this agent aids haemostasis by <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">stimulating coagulation</a>        <i>via</i> the release of calcium ions, Ca<sup>2+</sup>;</li>
    <li>calcium sulphate - this usually comes as a powder and a liquid
        which when mixed together form putty that can be placed
        into the cavity. This putty then exerts a tamponade effect
        and blocks the vascular channels;</li>
    <li>ferric sulphate - this is particularly useful for arresting
        multiple small bony bleeding points (however, it must
        be thoroughly rinsed out to prevent a foreign body reaction
        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a> formation);</li>
    <li>gelatin - this acts by stimulating the <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">intrinsic clotting pathway</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/collagen">collagen</a>        - this agent acts in a number of ways. In addition to
        having a mechanical tamponade effect, it also stimulates
        <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">platelet adhesion and aggregation</a>,
        activates <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">Factor VIII</a>        and releases serotonin, which in turn causes <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/vasopressor">vasoconstriction</a>;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/tranexamic">tranexamic acid</a>        mouthwash given pre- and post-operatively is sometimes
        used to aid haemostasis by inhibiting <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">fibrinolysis</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="identification-of-the-root-apex">Identification of the root apex</h1>
<p>If the lesion has perforated the cortical plate (hard, outer
    layer of bone), identification of the apex is relatively
    simple. However, if this has not occurred, an estimation
    of the tooth length from a good preoperative <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiograph</a>    is made. A small round burr, running in a slow handpiece
    with water irrigation, can then be used at this length with
    gentle pressure to explore the area and locate the lesion.
    Care is required to avoid damage to the roots of the adjacent
    teeth. The bone is gently pared away until the root apex
    is located and further bone removed to provide good access.</p>
<h1 id="periapical-curettage">Periapical curettage</h1>
<p>Any soft tissue lesion is carefully curetted (removed) from around
    the apex with excavators and sent for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histopathology examination</a>    if appropriate. Where possible, the lesion should be excavated
    in one piece and any remnants curetted out with sharp instruments.
    Sometimes, the tissue is firmly adherent to the apex, in
    which case the apex is resected and removed together with
    the soft tissue lesion.</p>
<h1 id="root-end-resection">Root end resection</h1>
<p>The aim of root end resection is to present the surface of the
    root so that the apical seal of the orthograde root filling
    can be examined, and to provide access for root end preparation.
    Approximately 2 to 3 mm of the root end is resected at right
    angles to the long axis of the tooth. A bevelled resection
    is avoided where possible because a larger surface area of
    dentinal tubules is exposed, which can lead to microleakage.
     Also, if the root end is bevelled, there is the possibility
    of leaving behind infected tooth tissue, or of missing part
    or all of the root canal system (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-rest-dentistry-surgical-endodontics-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A bevelled root end resection,
        resulting in the root canal being missed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Root end resection is effectively an apicectomy, and although
    the term ‘apicectomy’ has been commonly used to describe
    apical surgery, it only describes a small section of the
    whole procedure and is, therefore best avoided.</p>
<h1 id="root-end-cavity-preparation">Root end cavity preparation</h1>
<p>The ideal root end cavity preparation is defined as a class I
    preparation, at least 3 mm into root dentine with walls parallel
    to and coincident with the anatomic outline of the pulpal
    space. A contra-angled slow speed microhead handpiece with
    a small round burr has conventionally been used to prepare
    the cavity, but this does not relate to the anatomy of the
    pulp and often the apical dentine is weakened by unnecessary
    over- enlargement. There is also a considerable risk of perforating
    the root-end. Therefore, specifically designed ultrasonic
    instruments have been developed to create an accurate preparation.
    Their small tip size allows much greater access than even
    the microhead handpiece (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-rest-dentistry-surgical-endodontics-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> A comparison of the sizes of a
        microhead handpiece and an ultrasonic tip.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ultrasonic instrumentation enables the isthmus (narrow connection)
    running between some canals to be prepared and sealed. This
    isthmus is often a reservoir for bacteria that have not been
    removed during <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">conventional root canal therapy</a>    (Figure 5). In many developed countries the use of magnification
    and piezo (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasonic</a>    ) instruments are the accepted standard.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-rest-dentistry-surgical-endodontics-level2-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The contour and size of the ultrasonic
        tip allow better access to difficult areas of the mouth.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="root-end-retrograde-filling">Root end (retrograde) filling</h1>
<p>The purpose of the root end filling is to seal the apical section
    of the tooth and thus prevent any leakage between the oral
    environment and peri-radicular tissues. Before the root end
    filling is inserted, one of the haemostatic agents (described
    above) can be packed into the bony cavity to prevent contamination
    of the root end cavity.</p>
<p>In most situations a retrograde root filling is indicated. On
    occasions where the source of irritants is removed by the
    resection, and the rest of the canal is completely cleaned
    and obturated, it is acceptable simply to burnish the apical
    gutta percha. When a root end filling is to be used, there
    is a wide variety of materials available (Table 1), although
    not all are commonly used.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Amalgam</strong> has been used for many years because
    it is cheap, easy to handle and not particularly moisture
    sensitive. However, there are problems with its dimensional
    stability and corrosion, and it can cause staining of the
    mucosa if carelessly placed. Furthermore, amalgam does not
    provide an ideal apical seal. It is no longer regarded as
    an acceptable root end filling material in many developed
    countries.</p>
<p><strong>Zinc oxide / eugenol</strong> based materials have been
    used to good effect as retrograde filling materials. Leakage
    studies suggest less microleakage around these materials
    than amalgam, and because they are eugenol based there is
    some antibacterial activity.</p>
<p><strong>Glass ionomer</strong> has been shown to give a better
    seal than amalgam by adhering to dentine, and it has antibacterial
    activity against some endodontic pathogens. As well as being
    placed in the root end cavity, a thin smear of glass ionomer
    can be used to seal the whole root end surface. <strong>Composite</strong>    (organic polymer material) has also been used as a root end
    filling and, like glass ionomer, can be used to seal the
    root surface. Both glass ionomer and composite materials
    are very moisture sensitive, which is a distinct disadvantage
    in apical surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Mineral trioxide aggregate</strong> consists of a fine
    powder of tricalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, tricalcium
    oxide and silicon dioxide. The mixture sets in the presence
    of moisture. Hydration of the powder produces a colloidal
    gel with a pH value of 12.5 (a strongly basic gel) that solidifies
    to a hard cement. Mineral trioxide aggregate has several
    reported advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>very good sealing ability;</li>
    <li>low toxicity;</li>
    <li>very low <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammatory reaction</a>        to the material;</li>
    <li>an inductive effect on osteoblasts and cementoblasts (encouraging
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">bone regeneration</a>);</li>
    <li>no moisture sensitivity;</li>
    <li>low setting contraction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages of mineral trioxide aggregate are that it is
    relatively expensive and has a long setting time (4 hours)
    – although the initial set only takes several minutes. Despite
    this, current research is promising for the use of mineral
    trioxide aggregate in surgical endodontics, and it is the
    filling of choice for this purpose in most developed countries.</p>
<h1 id="wound-closure"><a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/detailed">Wound closure</a></h1>
<p>After placement of the root end filling material and débridement
    (cleaning) of the surgical area, the flap is reapproximated
    and compressed for 2 to 3 minutes prior to suturing. There
    is no evidence for the superiority of resorbable or non-resorbable
    sutures; 4-0 or 5-0 monofilament varieties have theoretical
    advantages. Cyanoacrylate adhesives and fibrin sealants have
    been used but are not widely adopted because of their unpredictable
    strength.</p>
<h1 id="aftercare">Aftercare</h1>
<p>The postoperative use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">anti-inflammatory analgesics</a>    may be advised. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">Chlorhexidine</a>    mouthwash, 10 ml rinsed twice daily is also prescribed. The
    use of prophylactic <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>    is controversial. There is no current evidence base for this
    although many still use this technique or even use postoperative
    antibacterials, which has even less theoretical or evidence
    based support. Ice packs, which are also commonly advised
    by some, have no real evidence base.</p>
<p>Sutures may resorb or be removed according to personal protocol.
    An <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiograph</a>    is taken at three months. Further radiographs are taken as
    appropriate to each individual situation.</p>
<h1 id="assessment-of-the-procedure">Assessment of the procedure</h1>
<p>Once endodontic surgery has been performed, it should be assessed
    after at least one year. Success is indicated by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>absence of symptoms such as pain and swelling;</li>
    <li>no sinus tract (abnormal draining channel);</li>
    <li>no loss of function;</li>
    <li>satisfactory soft tissue healing;</li>
