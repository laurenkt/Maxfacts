<p><strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong> is a component of skin, connective
    and nerve tissues where it is found in the extracellular
    matrix (the material surrounding cells) and where it has
    a number of structural and functional roles, plays a part
    in wound repair and local immune response and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>,
    and in cell migration (including potential involvement in
    the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastasis</a>    of malignancies). Hyaluronic acid (Figure 1) occurs in the
    body in the form of highly polymerised, very high molecular
    weight molecules (the number of repeat units, n (see Figure
    1) is such that typical molecular units, depending on the
    tissue in which the hyaluronic acid is located, will have
    a molecular mass of several thousand kg/mol). Hyaluronic
    acid belongs to the chemical class of sugars (carbohydrates;
    see below), specifically it is a glycosaminoglycan. <strong>Hyaluronidase</strong>    refers to a family of enzymes (catalysts) that are responsible
    for breaking down polymeric hyaluronic acid molecules during
    the normal ongoing process of renewal of body components.
    Hyaluronic acid synthases are a group of enzymes that facilitate
    the biosynthesis of new polymeric hyaluronic acid in this
    renewal process.</p>

<h1 id="properties-and-function-of-hyaluronic-acid-in-the-body">Properties and function of hyaluronic acid in the body</h1>
<p>Similar to other highly polymerised carbohydrates, hyaluronic
    acid easily accommodates water molecules and swells in the
    process. Other such examples of swelling by water uptake
    are the <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">insoluble fibres in foods</a>    (related to cellulose) such as wholegrain bread or pulses,
    helping the digestive process in this way; <a href="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-lubrication-level3">gelatin</a>    derived from animal <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/collagen">collagen</a>,
    turns liquid foods into jellies and acts as a food lubricant.
    Similar mechanisms underpin the two main effects of hyaluronic
    acid in the body, to act as a filler and as a lubricant.</p>
<p>The most prominent role of hyaluronic acid in the layers of skin
    is to act as a ‘filler’ to maintain the extracellular space
    as a well-hydrated structure. It is thought that the presence
    of hyaluronic acid in these structures may help to increase
    the presence of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/retinoid">retinoic acid</a>    (vitamin A) which, in turn, is thought to protect skin against
    damage by UV radiation and aging. Excessive exposure to UV
    radiation (sunburn) further reduces the concentration of
    hyaluronic acid in skin layers.</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid has an important function as a lubricant in joints
    and in muscular connective tissues (the fascia layers). One
    of the main components of synovial fluids (the fluids inside
    joint capsules) is hyaluronic acid. There it helps to adjust
    the viscosity of the synovial fluids such that the cartilage
    and the joint itself are optimally protected against wear
    and tear, for example caused by compression.</p>
<p>Closely related to this function as a local lubricant, hyaluronic
    acid also plays a more general role in enabling and regulating
    the movement and proliferation of cells. This is important
    in skin wound healing where <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">initial inflammation</a>,
    followed by angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels),
    granulation (formation of new tissue) and eventually fibrosis
    (formation of mature scar tissue) are facilitated by the
    presence of increased levels of hyaluronic acid in wounds.
    This facilitates the timely transport of the appropriate
    ‘repair materials’ to actual sites of need in repairing defects
    in all stages of wound healing, mainly by facilitating the
    detachment of cells. It is thought that hyaluronic acid supports
    the healing process by activating and moderating the initial
    inflammatory response to injury, by facilitating cell migration
    and proliferation into the wound matrix and by improving
    the structure of granulation tissue. It has been observed
    experimentally that hyaluronic acid levels remain high long
    after the healing of foetal wounds and it has been hypothesised
    that this may be (one of) the reason(s) why foetal wounds
    heal without scar formation.  </p>
<p>There are some hypotheses about potential involvement of hyaluronic
    acid in the spread of malignant cells to distant body sites.
    The argument here is that the mechanisms supported by hyaluronic
    acid in wound healing may be exploited in the formation of
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases/more-info">metastases</a>    by malignant cells becoming more easily detached from the
    original tumour site, as well as being helped to establish
    themselves in a distant site. It has also been noted that
    concentration of hyaluronic acid is correlated with disease
    progression in some prostate and breast cancers and its concentration
    is used as a biomarker in such cases to monitor disease progression.
    The general / potential role of hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase
    in tumour metastasis is a theme that is currently much debated
    and controversially interpreted, with lots of ongoing research.
    Another avenue of research in this context is based on the
    observation that the most common target receptor for hyaluronic
    acid to bind to the cell surface (a receptor called CD44)
    tends to be overexpressed in some malignant cell lines. Following
    these observations, it has been argued that in the future
    some hyaluronic acid preparations may be used as vehicles
    (‘nanomedicine’) that transport drugs more selectively to
    tumour target sites in order to reduce systemic adverse effects
    while improving drug uptake in malignant tissues.</p>
<h1 id="medical-uses-of-hyaluronic-acid-and-hyaluronidase">Medical uses of hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase</h1>
<p><strong>Medical uses of hyaluronidase preparations</strong> include
    its use to reverse the effects of failed or otherwise ‘unloved’
    dermal filler / hyaluronic acid injections. Another use is
    in ophthalmic (eye) surgery in combination with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">local analgesics</a>    to improve pain control.</p>
<p><strong>Medical and cosmetic uses of hyaluronic acid preparations</strong>    include its common use in skin care products and (in gel
    form) as an injectable dermal filler to smooth out temporarily
    facial wrinkles (the effect lasts for a few months). Hyaluronic
    acid is a component in preparations for the treatment of
    dry eye syndromes (‘artificial tears’) and for the treatment
    of dermatitis / dry skin. Injection of hyaluronic acid into
    joints is a treatment option for osteoarthritis. In maxillofacial
    surgery this approach is sometimes used to treat osteoarthritis
    of the <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-joint/detailed">temporomandibular (jaw) joint</a>.
    The evidence base for these intra-joint injections is controversial
    and there is a risk of severe adverse effects. Other than
    for its natural role in the processes of wound healing, there
    is no convincing evidence that applications of hyaluronic
    acid preparations augment and improve the healing of diabetic
    ulcers, burn wounds or surgical wounds.</p>
