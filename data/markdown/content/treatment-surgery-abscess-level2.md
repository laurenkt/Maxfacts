<p>One of the most dangerous mistakes anyone in healthcare can make
    is to misuse the term “dental abscess” when describing a
    substantial cervicofacial collection. This suggests a fairly
    minor “gum boil” condition when the reality is a potentially
    compromised airway in a septic patient.</p>
<h1 id="cervicofacial-abscess"><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess/detailed">Cervicofacial abscess</a></h1>
<p>The area needs to be drained and the cause removed. This will
    often involve drainage from the skin into the fascial spaces
    of the neck and sometime even into the mouth. In that case
    the drain must be removed early to prevent a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistula</a>    (an epithelial lined tract) from forming.</p>
<h1 id="ludwigs-angina"><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess/detailed">Ludwig’s angina</a></h1>
<p>The airway must be maintained and secured at an early stage.
    This will require intubation to allow drainage of the compressed
    infected region usually by fibre optic intubation. Tracheostomy
    or cricothyroidotomy should be procedures of last choice
    as a surgical airway under these conditions creates a high
    risk of mediastinitis and an approximate 50% mortality. The
    involved spaces should be decompressed, even though frequently
    little pus is obtained (see Figure 1). High dose intravenous
    antibiotics should be given to complement surgical decompression.
    Any infective focus should be removed.</p>

<p>These patients require aggressive resuscitation and debridement.
    The initial surgery should be supported by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">broad spectrum antibiotics</a>    (e.g. megadose penicillin, gentamycin and metronidazole).
    Second look surgery at 24 to 48 hours should be planned with
    further debridement as required. <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a>    may be helpful for these patients to eradicate the infection
    and provide a favourable environment for subsequent healing
    and reconstruction although there are few areas in the world
    where this is possible in the acute phase.</p>
<p>Infected foreign bodies should be removed early in order to avoid
    either of the preceding conditions arising.</p>
<p>Infected skin lesions generally don’t put the airway at risk
    but can give rise to substantial sepsis by creating spreading
    cellulitis.</p>
