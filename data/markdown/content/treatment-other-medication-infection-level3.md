<p>Below we describe in slightly more technical detail some commonly
    used antibiotic drugs to treat bacterial, fungal and viral
    infections. Our discussion will also include the timely topic
    of resistance to antibiotic drugs.</p>

<h1 id="antibacterial-agents">Antibacterial agents</h1>
<p>With a wide range of bacterial <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    being common problems encountered in a maxillofacial clinic,
    the prescription and use of antibacterial agents are common
    practice. Despite this, the number of different antibacterial
    agents routinely used in oral and maxillofacial surgery is
    fairly small but nevertheless includes examples of mechanisms
    from all <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">four categories of antibacterial interferences</a>,
    interfering with the bacterial cell wall, bacterial metabolism,
    bacterial protein synthesis or bacterial DNA.</p>
<h2>Antibacterial agents that interfere with the bacterial cell wall</h2>
<p>The best known representatives of this class of agents are probably
    the so called <i>β</i>-lactams, penicillin and its many derivatives.
    The general structure is shown in Figure 1 where the basic
    functional unit, the <i>β</i>-lactam 4-membered ring structure,
    is highlighted in red.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Left: the general molecular structure
        of β-lactams, such as penicillin; the basic functional
        unit is highlighted in red, R1 and R2 symbolise parts
        of the molecular structure that are varied in different
        members of the β-lactam group of antibacterial agents.
        Right: the molecular structure of isoniazid.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Widely used drugs from this group are penicillin (V &amp; G),
    ampicillin, amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, methicillin, several
    cephalosporin derivatives and clavulanic acid. The <i>β</i>-lactam
    derivative clavulanic acid itself is not an antibacterial
    agent but in combination with other <i>β</i>-lactam drugs
    it can overcome resistance (see below) in bacteria which
    would otherwise be able to inactivate <i>β</i>-lactam drugs
    by producing an enzyme, <i>β</i>-lactamase. Co-amoxiclav
    is the best known example.</p>
<p>Isoniazid (see right part of Figure 1) is a different type of
    chemical but also belongs to the class of antibacterial agents
    that alter the stability of the bacterial cell wall. It has
    no clinical role in maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>A less widely used, last-resort antibacterial agent is vancomycin
    (a natural product, isolated from some soil bacteria). Vancomycin
    very specifically interferes with the cell wall structures
    of Gram-positive bacteria. This does have rare indications
    in a maxillofacial clinic.</p>
<h2>Susceptible bacteria:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i>β</i>-lactam drugs are effective in treating a wide range
        of infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative
        bacteria, aerobes as well as anaerobes.</li>
    <li>Vancomycin is effective in treating a range of infections
        caused by Gram-positive bacteria and has virtually no
        effect on Gram-negative bacteria (some Gram-positive
        bacteria are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, and
        there is concern over growing numbers of acquired vancomycin
        resistances of several hard-to-treat bacterial strains).
        It is reserved for unusual infections in a hospital setting.</li>
    <li>Isoniazid is mainly effective in treating infections caused
        by mycobacteria tuberculosis – note NOT the atypical
        mycobacteria often seen in maxillofacial clinics as a
        cause of neck lumps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where these are useful antibacterial agents:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Owing to the broad-banded properties of the <i><strong>β</strong></i><strong>-lactam antibacterial agents</strong>,
        these are a common first-line choice of treatment for
        a number of oral and maxillofacial infections, including
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscesses</a>, cellulitis,
        severe alveolar osteitis, acute periodontal disease,
        necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (although see comments
        about anaerobicidal drugs), impetigo, erysipelas and
        actinomycosis.</li>
    <li>Isoniazid, usually in combination with rifampicin (see below),
        is effective for the treatment of mycobacteria and thus
        is used for the treatment of tuberculosis.</li>
    <li>Vancomycin is one of the few remaining last-resort antibacterial
        agents for the treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a>,
        severe lower respiratory tract and some bone infections.
        It also has a limited role topically in the management
        of antibiotic-induced colitis caused by clostridium  difficile<i>.</i></li>
     </ul>

        infections, this information is in our section about

</aside>
<h2>Agents that interfere with bacterial metabolism</h2>
<p>Sulphonamides inhibit the bacterial folic acid synthesis and
    historically were the first systemically administered broad-spectrum
    antibacterial agents, initially with spectacular success.
    They are no longer widely used because of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">unwanted effects</a>    and increasing issues with bacterial resistance (see below).
    Figure 2 depicts the basic functional unit in sulphonamides
    in red. Another antibacterial agent which inhibits a different
    stage of bacterial folic acid synthesis is trimethoprim (see
    Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Top part: the basic functional
        unit in the molecular structure of sulphonamides, R1,
        R2 and R3 symbolise parts of the molecular structure
        that are varied in different sulphonamide drugs. Bottom
        part: the molecular structure of trimethoprim.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Susceptible bacteria:</strong> unless there are resistance
    issues with sulphonamides (which are common), these include
    a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, chlamydia,
    e.coli, klebsiella, salmonella, shigella and enterobacter
    species.</p>
<p><strong>Where these are useful antibacterial agents:</strong>    sulphonamides are rarely used as a single agent but trimethoprim,
    and especially combinations of trimethoprim with a sulphonamide,
    are still used for the treatment of urinary tract infections.</p>
<h2>Agents that interfere with the bacterial protein synthesis</h2>
<p>A wide range of different chemical compounds inhibit bacterial
    protein synthesis by interfering with the bacterial ribosome
    in various different ways. Figure 3 depicts some examples
    from this group of different antibacterial agents that are
    commonly used. These include natural products (for example,
    chemicals with antibacterial properties which are synthesised
    by other microbes), semi-synthetic and synthetic compounds.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Top left: the basic functional
        unit in the molecular structure of a macrolide antibacterial
        agent; top right: the molecular structure of gentamicin;
        bottom left: the molecular structure of clindamycin;
        bottom right: the basic functional unit in the molecular
        structure of a tetracycline highlighted in red, R1, R2,
        R3 and R4 symbolise parts of the molecular structure
        that are varied in different tetracycline drugs.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Macrolides (Figure 3 top left) are natural products and include
    compounds such as clarithromycin and erythromycin. Another
    semi-synthetic antibacterial agent is clindamycin (Figure
    3 bottom left). Gentamicin (and streptomycin) belongs to
    the chemical class of aminoglycosides (Figure 3 top right).
    A number of synthetic tetracycline derivatives (Figure 3
    bottom right) are another class of antibacterial drugs.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows yet another antibacterial agent which interferes
    with bacterial protein synthesis, chloramphenicol.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The molecular structure of chloramphenicol.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Susceptible bacteria:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Macrolides are effective in treating infections mostly by
        Gram-positive bacteria, including a range of streptococci,
        pneumococci, staphylococci and enterococci species; macrolides
        are also effective in the treatment of chlamydia, legionella,
        mycobacteria and mycoplasma species.</li>
    <li>Clindamycin is effective in treating infections by Gram-positive
        aerobic bacteria such as most staphylococcus and streptococcus
        species (many Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (for example,
        pseudomonas, legionella, haemophilus influenza and some
        enterobacter species are resistant to clindamycin; see
        below); clindamycin can also be used for the treatment
        of infections with some Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria,
        mostly rod-shaped species.</li>
    <li>Aminoglycosides are effective in treating infections mostly
        by Gram-negative, aerobic bacteria, including pseudomonas,
        e. coli, klebsiella and some enterobacter species (some
        pseudomonas, enterococci and staphylococci species, including
        staphylococcus aureus, are resistant to gentamicin).</li>
    <li>Tetracyclines started as a group of highly broad-banded antibacterial
        agents, effective against almost all clinically relevant
        Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, aerobes and
        anaerobes. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance (see below)
        of tetracyclines has become a common feature for a number
        of staphylococcus, streptococcus, pneumococcus, neisseria
        and enterobacter species, as well as many anaerobes.</li>
    <li>Chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity
        and is effective in the treatment of infections caused
        by streptococcus e. coli and staphylococcus (including
        staphylococcus aureus) species. It is also active against
        the most common causes of bacterial meningitis, neisseria
        meningitides, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus
        influenza.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where these are useful antibacterial agents:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Macrolides have a spectrum of activity slightly wider than,
        but similar to, that of <i>β</i>-lactam antibacterial
        agents. In a maxillofacial clinic they are a second line
        drug in the penicillin allergic patient, especially erythromycin
        is an alternative choice.</li>
    <li>Clindamycin is used for the treatment of dental, respiratory
        tract and bone infections; it is another alternative
        choice where people are intolerant of <i>β</i>-lactams.
        Clindamycin is more widely used in Europe than in the
        UK where it is rarely used because of its rare but potentially
        serious <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">unwanted effects</a>:
        it lost popularity in the UK due to its association with
        antibiotic-induced colitis.</li>
    <li>Aminoglycosides are mainly used systemically for the initial
        treatment of serious infections (including respiratory
        tract infections and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a>);
        otherwise it is mainly topical use of aminoglycosides
        in orthopaedic trauma surgery for the local treatment
        of bone and soft tissue infections and maxillofacial
        surgery for osteomyelitis of the jaws. Most aminoglycosides
        are used in an injection format.</li>
    <li>Tetracyclines remain useful drugs for the treatment of some
        mixed mouth and throat and some bone and some sinus infections.
        The latter in particular with regard to infections with
        meningococci. In addition, tetracyclines get incorporated
        into living bone tissue. Since the tetracycline molecules
        can be identified by their fluorescence (a particular
        stimulated emission of light), they can be used as marker
        molecules for the identification of healthy and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">necrotic bone tissues</a>.</li>
    <li>Chloramphenicol easily passes the blood – brain barrier,
        so has a role in the treatment of brain abscesses and
        bacterial meningitis in general as a systemic drug. It
        is not widely used systemically otherwise because of
        its potentially serious <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">unwanted effects</a>.
        In a maxillofacial surgery context, the main role of
        chloramphenicol is as a topical drug, to treat skin infections,
        to prevent (or treat) infections after skin grafting,
        and in the form of an ointment for the <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/detailed">aftercare of surgical wounds</a>.
        It is particularly useful as the topical eye ointment
        comes in a small sterile package for self- application
        even though that is not what it was designed for. Chloramphenicol
         is available only as an intravenous and topical preparation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Agents that interfere with the bacterial DNA</h2>
<p>Similar to the antibacterial agents that interfere with bacterial
    protein synthesis (see above), interference with bacterial
    DNA synthesis is also a working principle of a wide range
    of different chemical compounds used as antibacterial agents.</p>
<p>By far the most prominent member of this class of antibacterial
    agents in maxillofacial surgery is metronidazole (see Figure
    5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The molecular structure of metronidazole.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Metronidazole belongs to the class of chemicals called nitroimidazoles;
    they can be classed as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">pro-drugs</a>    because it is necessary for the NO<sub>2</sub> group in the
    molecule to be chemically reduced (modified) before interference
    with DNA synthesis can occur.</p>
<p>Rifampicin, a natural product belonging to a group of chemicals
    called rifamycins (see Figure 6) and the group of fluoro-quinolones
    (see Figure 7) also interfere with bacterial DNA, though
    in different ways from the mechanism exploited by metronidazole.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The molecular structure of rifampicin.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> The basic functional unit in the
        molecular structure of fluoro-quinolones; R<sup>1</sup>,
        R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup> are varied
        in different compounds of this class.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Susceptible bacteria:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Metronidazole, owing to the requirement of chemical reduction
        for achieving its antibacterial function, has a wide
        spectrum of activity in treating infections caused by
        anaerobes (but has little or no effect on aerobes).</li>
    <li>Rifampicin is effective in treating infections by meningococci,
        listeria, neisseria and legionella species, as well as
        haemophilus influenzae.</li>
    <li>F-quinolones are mainly effective in treating infections
        by Gram-positive bacteria.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where these are useful antibacterial agents:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Metronidazole is a widely used, first-line drug in the treatment
        of many dental, oral and maxillofacial infections, often
        in combination with <i>β</i>-lactam antibacterial agents
        (see above) in the treatment of severe infections as
        they have a synergistic (additive) effect. In addition
        it is used in the prevention of bacterial infections:
        it is widely used in a single-shot mode prophylactically
        in oral and head and neck surgery.</li>
    <li>Rifampicin is not a first-line, widely used antibacterial
        agent but has several important uses in treating maxillofacial
        fractures at risk of infection (rifampicin enters the
        spinal liquid and thus the brain), it usually is part
        of a combination therapy for treating tuberculosis, it
        is used for the treatment of some bone and (prosthetic)
        joint infections, and is sometimes used in the treatment
        regimen for MRSA infections.</li>
    <li>F-quinolones are not widely used because of their <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">unwanted effects</a>        but can be useful in the treatment of chest and urinary
        tract infections as well as some bone infections such
        as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">osteomyelitis</a>        (similar to tetracyclines (see above), quinolones are
        incorporated in bone tissue). If used, they are usually
        used in combination with other antibacterial agents because
        many pathogens are resistant to quinolone drugs, or can
        rapidly acquire resistance even over a short course of
        treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="antifungal-agents">Antifungal agents</h1>
<p>The two most commonly used antifungal agents in maxillofacial
    surgery are fluconazole and miconazole (see Figure 8 for
    molecular structures). Both agents hinder the ergosterol
    synthesis in the fungal cell membrane.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Left: the molecular structure
        of fluconazole; right: the molecular structure of miconazole.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fluconazole is administered systemically (orally or intravenously),
    whereas miconazole is used topically (cream on skin, gel
    in mouth). The majority of maxillofacial fungal infections
    are caused by candida species, most of which are susceptible
    to treatment with fluconazole. Where fluconazole fails, fortunately
    in most cases there is no fungal resistance to miconazole.
    However, there are some (rare) hard-to-treat fungal infections
    by candida species which are resistant to first-line antifungal
    agents.</p>
<h1 id="antiviral-agents">Antiviral agents</h1>
<p>The one antiviral agent that is likely to be prescribed in a
    maxillofacial clinic is aciclovir, the most commonly used
    antiviral drug to treat herpes infections (herpes simplex
    infections and shingles). Aciclovir works by preventing viral
    DNA replication.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure9.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> The molecular structure of acyclovir.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="resistance-to-antibiotic-agents">Resistance to antibiotic agents</h1>
<p>The developing resistance issues with antibiotic agents are most
    concerning and most wide-spread as far as antibacterial agents
    are concerned (although similar issues and mechanisms exist
    for antifungal and antiviral drugs). Accordingly, most of
    our discussion will be addressing bacterial resistance.</p>
<h2>Resistance to antibacterial agents</h2>
<p>With the increased use and overuse of antibacterial agents there
    has inevitably been the development of bacterial strains,
    which have resistance to the most commonly used antibacterial
    agents. Resistance arises when selective pressure is placed
    upon bacterial colonies by antibacterial agents: most of
    the bacteria present are sensitive to the antibacterial used;
    however some remaining (few) bacteria are not eliminated
    by the antibacterial agent and are then described as resistant.
    These surviving bacteria can continue to multiply while being
    unaffected by the continued use of the applied antibacterial
    agent, without competition from other bacteria. In this way
    these surviving bacteria are said to have been selected for
    their desirable resistance traits.</p>
<p>As antibacterial agents are being used increasingly, bacterial
    strains resistant to multiple antibacterial agents, so called
    ‘superbugs’ have evolved (much attention has been paid in
    the media to MRSA in the context of hospital-acquired infections,
    or more recently to the worrying trend of increasing numbers
    of mycobacterial infections that cannot be treated by any
    existing antibacterial agents).</p>
<p>Some bacteria have acquired resistance naturally as they produce
    antibacterial agents to which their competitor bacteria are
    susceptible. Many such natural antibacterial agents have
    been in existence for millions of years (for example, produced
    by the myriads of useful soil bacteria), it thus makes sense
    that bacterial resistance mechanisms would have also been
    necessary to be in existence for a similar length of time.</p>
<p>Figure 10 depicts a cartoon version of a monstrous ‘virtual’
    bacterium. The figure symbolises a super-super-bug that has
    acquired every known trick to the bacterial world to counteract
    man-made antibacterial agents (to the best of our knowledge,
    no such super-super-bug exists (yet), but there are several
    known bacterial strands which use more than one of these
    mechanisms to counteract the effects of antibacterial agents).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure10.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> A pictorial representation of
        a bacterium with multiple mechanisms available to counteract
        antibacterial agents.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are four main mechanisms of action which bacteria use in
    order to resist antibacterial agents:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>altering antibacterial enzymes and antibacterial molecules</strong>        (reduces complementarity to bacterial molecules and structures)</li>
    <li><strong>breaking down of antibacterial molecules</strong>        (before they are able to perform their function)</li>
    <li><strong>efflux pumps</strong> (swift removal of antibacterial
        agent from the cell once it managed to get into the cell)
        <strong>and prevention of pore formation</strong> (removal
        or blockage of pathways into the cell for antibacterial
        agent)</li>
    <li><strong>ribosomal modifications</strong> (prevention of antibacterial
        interference with protein synthesis).</li>
</ul>
<p>The resistance issue is made worse by the ability of bacteria
    to pass on their resistance traits and in this way increase
    the numbers of resistant bacteria on an exponential scale.
    Resistance genes can be contained on chromosomal (nuclear)
    or extrachromosomal DNA (plasmid). Figure 11 symbolises the
    way in which the plasmid can carry resistance genes. Within
    a bacterial cell, DNA components are also stored on plasmids
    (circular DNA loops) outside of the nucleus in the cell cytoplasm
    (extrachromosomal DNA). This plasmid DNA is replicated independently
    without regulation from the rest of the cell.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-medication-infection-level3-figure11.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> A pictorial representation of
        the way in which a bacterium can incorporate resistance
        gene information in the plasmid.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Resistance genes usually arise due to chance mutations of the
    DNA which provide bacteria with a selective advantage (established
    when brought into contact with antibacterial agents). The
    different ways in which resistance genes are passed on are
    sketched in Figure 12 and Figure 13.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical transmission:</strong> resistance is passed
    on from one generation to the next during bacterial cell
    replication and DNA replication of the resistance-containing
    chromosome.</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal conjugation:</strong> bacteria form connections
    (pili) with non-resistant bacteria through which to pass
    on resistance genes contained on plasmids (extra-chromosomal
    DNA).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Resistance is passed on from
        resistant bacteria to non-resistant bacteria.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Alteration of antibacterial enzymes and antibacterial molecules</strong>    (see Figure 10)<strong>:</strong> the bacterial cell may
    produce molecules to modify and inhibit the antibacterial
    enzyme so it can no longer carry out its function. The bacterial
    cell may also apply modifications to its own enzymes (as
    typically targeted by antibacterials) such as those important
    in folic acid synthesis or other bacterial biosynthetic pathways.
    These modifications impact on the shape of the active site
    and so prevent the binding of inhibitor (antibacterial) molecules.
    Bacteria may also modify incoming antibacterial molecules
    such that they cannot bind to the recognition sites of the
    bacterial cell surface membrane, and so prevent antibacterials
    from entering the cell altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Break down of antibacterial molecules</strong> (see Figure
    10)<strong>:</strong> a mutation may result in DNA coding
    for enzymes which are able to break down antibacterial molecules,
    preventing them from entering the cell intact and binding
    with their target, hence causing the antibacterial agent
    to be ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Efflux pumps and prevention of pore formation</strong>    (see Figure 10)<strong>:</strong> some antibacterial agents
    are able to attach to molecules within the plasma membrane
    of bacteria and form porins (channels) which make the bacterial
    cell permeable, leading to eventual bacterial cell death
    (also a common working principle of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antifungal agents</a>).
    Bacterial cells can be resistant to this effect by making
    changes to porins and/or introducing efflux pumps into their
    membranes. The efflux pumps are able to remove antibacterial
    agent from the cell swiftly once it has been successful in
    getting into the cell - before the antibacterial is able
    to perform its function. Efflux is a mechanism commonly employed
    by most bacteria to reduce antibacterial agent concentration
    in cells.</p>
<p><strong>Ribosomal modifications</strong> (see Figure 10)<strong>:</strong>    there are many sites on the ribosome to which antibacterial
    agents can potentially bind and through which they can interfere
    with protein synthesis. Advantageous resistance mutations
    within the DNA, which codes for the proteins which make up
    the ribosome structure, allows the ribosomal structure to
    change so as to prevent antibacterial agents from binding.
    Some bacteria also synthesise proteins, which pass through
    the binding site of the ribosome and clear out any antibacterial
    agents, which may have managed to bind successfully to the
    ribosome (sometimes such proteins are referred to as ‘bottle
    brushes’).</p>
<p><strong>Some comments about the spread of bacterial resistance</strong>    (see Figure 11)<strong>:</strong> within the plasmid there
    may be genes of antibacterial resistance, arising either
    from a genetic mutation or due to adaptation against naturally
    occurring antibacterial agents. These are sometimes present
    in some bacterial cells as a line of defense against competitor
    bacteria. These resistance genes code for particular proteins.
    These proteins are then complicit in rendering antibacterials
    useless through destruction or inhibition through all of
    the various mechanisms described above.</p>
<p>Of particular concern with regard to antibacterial resistance
    is the ability of bacterial cells to replicate the plasmid
    containing the resistance gene and pass it on through conjugation
    (direct contact) to other bacterial cells, allowing more
    and more bacterial cells to inherit resistance to certain
    antibacterial agents. This is a particularly efficient way
    of spreading resistance amongst bacterial colonies (in addition
    to the ‘normal’ way of handing genetic information over from
    generation to generation). The horizontal plasmid-dependent
    mechanism is mainly responsible for the rapid development
    and establishment of multiple resistance genes in one bacterial
    strand, allowing for bacterial strands to develop which are
    resistant to many different types of antibacterial agents.</p>
<p>Resistance issues have been reported for all classes of antibacterial
    agents but multiple such issues are becoming more common
    for many of the first-line, widely used antibacterial agents,
    including</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>β</i>-lactams</li>
    <li>chloramphenicol</li>
    <li>macrolides</li>
    <li>rifamycins</li>
    <li>quinolones</li>
    <li>tetracylines</li>
    <li>isoniazid.</li>
</ul>
