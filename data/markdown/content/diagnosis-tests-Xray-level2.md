<p>X-rays are radiation in the ionising, high-energy range of the
    electromagnetic spectrum of radiation (Figure 1). We cannot
    see this form of radiation because the human eye is only
    capable of observing frequencies within the narrow band of
    visible light. X-rays are utilised in the diagnosis (radiography)
    and treatment (<a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>)
    of numerous conditions.</p>

        radiation; with X-rays and gamma rays at the high-energy
        end of the scale.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>X-ray radiation was first discovered in 1895 by the German physicist
    Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen who named it ‘X-radiation’ to signify
    its unknown nature. Radiation in this frequency range is
    important because it has enough energy to pass through materials
    that are opaque to visible light and other forms of electromagnetic
    radiation. The ability of X-rays to pass easily through skin,
    plastic and so on makes this a powerful imaging tool for
    use in medicine and other areas - to ‘see’ inside the body,
    or in airport security to check luggage; the list of X-ray
    applications is long.</p>
<p>The basic physical principles outlined below equally apply to
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scans</a>. Ordinary
    X-ray images are two-dimensional projections of X-ray representations
    of parts of the three-dimensional body. CT scans instead
    take multiple X-ray images of a three-dimensional object
    from many different angles and in this way permit the reconstruction
    of three-dimensional images from the complete data set.</p>
<p>Radiography as a diagnostic imaging technique aims to create
    the highest possible X-ray image resolution with the lowest
    possible radiation dose in order to prevent any unnecessary
    tissue damage from exposure to high-energy radiation.</p>
<h1 id="how-it-works-in-principle">How it works in principle</h1>
<p>X-rays are produced when the kinetic energy of sufficiently fast
    (accelerated) electrons is converted into electromagnetic
    radiation, that is photons. In medical imaging this is primarily
    done using so called X-ray tubes. An X-ray tube is an evacuated
    glass vessel housing two electrodes: a negatively charged
    cathode and a positively charged anode. The cathode typically
    consists of a tungsten filament and is the <i>source</i>    of the electrons. The anode is similarly constructed using
    an outer surface of tungsten and is the <i>target</i> of
    the electrons.</p>
<p>When a high voltage is applied across the tube, electrons are
    emitted from the cathode. These accelerate towards the anode
    and, on striking the target, cause the emission of photons
    with energies in the X-ray range. In order to record an X-ray
    image, the relevant part of the body will be strategically
    positioned between the X-ray source and a detector. Positioning
    is important both to ensure enough X-rays are detected (for
    good spatial resolution of the image) and to keep the radiation
    dose received as low as reasonably possible (to avoid tissue
    damage; known in the medical world as ALARA – as low as reasonably
    achievable). There are many different types of detectors,
    depending on the application area of X-ray investigations.</p>
<p>X-rays travel in straight lines (like visible light) from the
    source and, on passing through the body, are attenuated (weakened)
    by interactions with the various body tissues. Historically
    X-ray images were recorded on photographic film and developed
    using a dark room.</p>
<p>Different tissues absorb X-rays at different rates and this differential
    absorption creates the familiar ‘shades of grey’ contrast
    seen in X-ray (and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>)
    images. Calcified structures such as bones and teeth absorb
    X-rays most strongly and thus appear white on the traditional
    photographic film radiographs, since fewer X-rays are reaching
    the photographic film. Air barely absorbs any X-rays, resulting
    in a blackening of the image corresponding to such regions.
    Soft tissues (fat, muscle, organs) have varying levels of
    absorption and appear as shades of grey on the image. We
    cannot feel the passage of X-ray radiation through the body. </p>
<p>The use of photographic film in radiography has now largely been
    superseded by digital technologies. Digitally recorded X-ray
    images have some advantages over traditional film. Digitally
    recorded X-ray images can be immediately viewed (and shared)
    on high-resolution computer screens and the image data can
    be easily stored. The radiation doses required for digital
    X-ray images tend to be slightly lower than with the use
    of traditional film X-rays: digital data can be electronically
    enhanced, so an essentially lower-resolution data set may
    still provide an acceptable image resolution.</p>
<p>Digital X-ray images typically still look like old-fashioned
    ‘shades of grey’ X-ray images recorded on photographic film,
    mainly because the companies producing X-ray imaging equipment
    were afraid of causing culture shock in the medical community
    by switching to a completely different pictorial representation
    of X-ray images. This point is not quite as trivial as it
    may seem: the human eye can only distinguish grey-scale contrast
    above a certain threshold; alternative visual representations
    of X-ray (and other digitally recorded) imaging results may
    well have technical advantages – there is an ongoing discussion
    about this.</p>
<h1 id="dental-panoramic-radiograph-dpt"> Dental panoramic radiograph (DPT)</h1>
<p>One of the most commonly used X-ray examinations for oral and
    maxillofacial conditions is the dental panoramic radiograph
    (DPT), a panoramic X-ray image of the upper and lower jaws
    and teeth.</p>
<p>Obtaining such a panoramic, extra-oral radiograph involves a
    rotating mechanism with the X-ray source and the detector
    placed opposite to each other and the head carefully positioned
    in between. For recording the image, the X-ray source moves
    in a semi-circle around the back of the head and the detector
    moves similarly in a semi-circle opposite the X-ray source.
    Careful positioning of the head permits focus mainly on the
    upper and lower jaw regions while deeper and more superficial
    structures will be blurred in the image. The idea is to i)
    maintain a constant distance between the focus region to
    the X-ray generator and the detector, and ii) to obtain a
    perfect perpendicular projection at every stage of the screening.
    It is impossible to find such a perfect solution and the
    acquisition of DPTs is by necessity a practical compromise.</p>
<p>In practice, these panoramic images do show projection artefacts
    and ghost images, and there is a shadow from the cervical
    (neck) spine. It is important to remember that a two-dimensional
    representation / projection of a three-dimensional object
    will never be a perfect representation. Overall, a DPT does
    not provide highly defined local detail but gives a very
    good overview with a relatively low <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray/detailed">exposure to X-ray radiation</a>–
    in many practical situations very highly resolved local detail
    is not required anyway. Panoramic radiographs can also be
    obtained for people suffering from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>    or from a particularly active gagging reflex, both making
    the recording of intraoral radiographs difficult or impossible.
    Figure 2 shows an example of a panoramic radiograph.</p>

<h1 id="plain-x-ray-film">Plain X-ray film</h1>
<p>Mainly used in the domain of dentistry (bitewing radiographs
    for single teeth) but also with some applications in oral
    &amp; maxillofacial surgery investigations, the intraoral
    placement of a piece of X-ray film together with a suitable
    choice of angle for taking the (single) X-ray image and projecting
    it onto the film can provide useful information. For example,
    calculi (stones) of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">submandibular or sublingual salivary glands</a>    can be well characterised by such a straightforward plain
    radiograph.</p>
<h1 id="cone-beam-computed-tomograph-cbct">Cone beam computed tomograph (CBCT)</h1>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray/detailed">Cone bean computed tomography, CBCT</a>,
    is a more recent technique to obtain X-ray images of the
    head and neck region. The method uses a differently shaped
    X-ray beam (a cone shaped beam) and was introduced as an
    alternative to both DPT (see above) and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a>    imaging. The radiation dose is significantly higher than
    for a DPT image, but significantly lower than in a CT scan.
    CBCT images do suffer from artefacts similar to those in
    DPT images. CBCT has been advertised as the new gold standard
    of X-ray imaging in dental and oral applications – its benefits
    and disadvantages remain to be properly assessed.</p>
<h1 id="common-contrast-agents-in-x-ray-investigations">Common contrast agents in X-ray investigations</h1>
<p>Sometimes the use of a chemical substance called a contrast agent
    is required to improve the contrast in an X-ray image, enabling
    investigations on structures that would otherwise be difficult
    to observe. The ideal contrast agents should give maximum
    contrast for minimum effective radiation dose and have few,
    or no, adverse effects.</p>
<p>Contrast agents for X-ray investigations work by accumulating
    in structures/organs and need to be extremely efficient at
    absorbing X-rays. ‘Heavy’ elements (relative to the other
    chemical elements in the body) fulfil this task as X-ray
    contrast agents: the atoms of heavy chemical elements have
    a large number of electrons, and they absorb X-rays <i>via</i>    the so-called <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray/detailed">photoelectric effect</a>.
    The more electrons in an atom of a substance, the more efficiently
    it will absorb X-rays – X-ray radiation will efficiently
    knock out ‘photoelectrons’ from such X-ray contrast agent
    substances.</p>
<p>This excellent power of absorption of X-rays by contrast agents
    strongly enhances the contrast in X-ray images between the
    investigated area (where the contrast agent accumulates)
    and surrounding tissues. The most commonly used X-ray contrast
    agents are barium sulphate and iodine, with both barium and
    iodine being heavy chemical elements.</p>
<p><strong>Barium sulphate</strong> is a white powder which is administered
    orally as a thick suspension in water. Barium sulphate is
    used because it is essentially insoluble in water, hence
    will leave the body as it entered and hence has no toxic
    side effects. It is used for a type of X-ray investigation
    called a ‘barium swallow’ to examine <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing difficulties</a>    (when swallowed, the barium sulphate suspension coats the
    lining of the throat and gullet, giving very detailed images
    of these structures and their functions). The swallowing
    process is examined along the passage through larynx and
    pharynx (throat) and oesophagus (gullet) by sipping some
    barium sulphate suspension, followed by recording essentially
    an X-ray video of the swallowing process.</p>
<p><strong>Iodine</strong> (in an aqueous solution) is used as an
    X-ray contrast agent for the examination of obstructions
    in the ducts of salivary glands, the recording of a sialogram.
    The iodine solution is injected into the salivary gland duct,
    followed by the recording of X-ray images to track the flow
    as well as structural local details. An aqueous, rather than
    an oily, iodine solution is used because it has low viscosity
    (hence will help to depict very fine detail) and does not
    cause any lasting problems if there is a leakage from the
    duct. Figure 3 shows an example of a sialogram. There may
    be some minor discomfort with the injection of the iodine
    contrast agent into the duct of a salivary gland. Iodine
    as a contrast agent has the advantage of being a bacteriocidal
    (killing bacteria) substance, although it is also quite allergenic.</p>

        duct of a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems">salivary gland</a>.</figcaption>

<p>Contrast agents commonly used for X-ray investigations are usually
    well tolerated.</p>
<h1 id="radiation-dosage-exposure-in-diagnostic-x-ray-imaging">Radiation dosage exposure in diagnostic X-ray imaging</h1>
<p>Diagnostic X-ray imaging uses the lowest possible <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray/detailed">dose of radiation</a>,
    the recording of a single X-ray image of a small area, such
    as a single tooth, only leads to radiation exposure for a
    fraction of a second. When thinking about X-ray radiation
    exposure from medical imaging, it may be useful to remember
    that we are being continually exposed to naturally occurring,
    ionising background radiation from the environment. For example,
    recording of a DPT image results in radiation exposure to
    approximately 0.01 mSv (milliSievert; Sievert is the unit
    in which radiation dose is often measured), equivalent to
    approximately 1.5 days exposure to natural background radiation.
    This is different with CT scans: a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT scan</a>    of the head amounts to 2 mSv radiation dose, equivalent to
    natural background radiation of approximately one year.</p>
<p>As with all interventions, risks and benefits must be weighed.
    These considerations will be different for a pregnant woman,
    for an infant or for an elderly person.</p>
