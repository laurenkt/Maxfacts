<h1 id="oral-mucosal-lesions-related-to-infections">Oral mucosal lesions related to infections</h1>
<p>Bacterial, fungal and viral infections are common causes of oral
    mucosal lesions. In fact, infections of the mouth are so
    common that they are described and discussed in a separate
    section dealing with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>.
    Here we list common infections which typically give rise
    to mucosal lesions.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about oral and maxillofacial infections
        and treatments, this information is on our pages about
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a> and
        treatment options for infections, <a href="/treatment/surgery/infection">surgical</a>        and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">medication-based</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Oral <strong>bacterial infections</strong> include pericoronitis,
    alveolar osteitis (dry socket), acute and (more commonly)
    chronic <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>,
    necrotising ulcerative gingivitis, dentoalveolar <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>.
    Scarlet fever, syphilis and tuberculosis can all give rise
    to oral lesions.</p>
<p><strong>Viral infections</strong> with oral manifestations include
    herpes simplex (acute, chronic and recurrent), varicella
    zoster (primary causing chickenpox, later in life after dormancy
    causing shingles), Epstein-Barr virus (glandular fever),
    cytomegalovirus, coxsackie virus A (herpangina and hand,
    foot and mouth disease (affecting children)) and human immunodeficiency
    virus, HIV infections (increased risk of oral bacterial and
    fungal infections).</p>
<p><strong>Fungal infections</strong> are almost always caused by
    <i>candida</i> species (<i>albicans</i> being the most common),
    causing acute (thrush) and chronic forms of fungal infection
    (candidiasis) and include opportunistic infections following
    treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">broad-spectrum antibacterials</a>    or inhaled <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">steroids</a>    (erythematous candidiasis). Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis
    can give rise to a form of candidal <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">leukoplakia</a>,
    persistent white patches with a tendency for abnormal cell
    growth (see below).</p>
<h1 id="recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis-mouth-ulcers">Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers)</h1>
<p><strong>Minor aphthous ulcers</strong> are a very common condition,
    affecting about a third of the population, and are the most
    common form of mouth ulcer. The most likely cause is a combination
    of some (auto)immune reaction, possibly in combination with
    some genetic disposition; the condition occurs in familial
    clusters.</p>
<p>The small ulcers (a few mm in size) tend to appear in groups
    in the oral mucosa and heal, without scarring, in 1 to 2
    weeks. Recurrence intervals are usually a few months, the
    condition is worsened by stress and is influenced by hormonal
    effects (such as the menstrual cycle). Occasionally such
    minor ulcers can be signs of other diseases (see below).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-oral-mucosal-lesion-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Top: a classical aphthous ulcer;
        bottom: an unusual site for an aphthous ulcer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Major aphthous ulcers</strong> are a less common variant
    of mouth ulcers (about 10 % of cases), with more severe symptoms,
    larger ulcers and more frequent recurrences. These ulcers
    heal with scarring and are more often a sign of some other
    underlying disease (see below).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-oral-mucosal-lesion-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A major aphthous ulcer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The least common form, <strong>herpetiform ulcers</strong>, mostly
    affect older females. Herpetiform ulcers resemble oral ulcers
    caused by viral liver infections (see below) but are not
    caused by infection. These ulcers occur in clusters of numerous
    small, painful ulcers in any area of the mouth and frequently
    recur over extended periods of time (sometimes several years).</p>
<h1 id="mucositis">Mucositis</h1>
<p>Oral mucositis is a severe and painful inflammation and ulceration
    of the mucosa, the lining of the mouth. Mucositis can affect
    the entire gastrointestinal tract and is a common severe
    side effect of cancer treatments, both <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    and <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, as
    well as part of a rare but serious complication after bone
    marrow transplants (so called <a href="/treatment/surgery/tumour/blood-malignancy">graft versus host reaction</a>).
    Oral mucositis can be so severe as to be a treatment-limiting
    effect. The mucosa is vulnerable to these effects because
    of its relatively high rate of tissue renewal.</p>
<p>Mucositis ulcers are vulnerable to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>.
    Some degrees of oral mucositis occur commonly as an unwanted
    effect of nearly all systemic chemotherapies (with some agents,
    such as <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles">5-fluorouracil</a>,
    more likely to cause severe mucositis than other cytotoxic
    drugs) and radiotherapies. It often is particularly severe
    during <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">leukaemia</a>    treatment in children (childhood leukaemias tend to be treated
    with aggressive chemotherapy schemes).</p>
<p>Mucositis caused by radiotherapy for the treatment of head and
    neck cancers, especially in combination with chemotherapy,
    tends to be particularly severe. Radiotherapy applied to
    the head and neck region almost always causes (variable degrees
    of) damage to the salivary glands, leading to problems with
    dry mouth, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>    which exacerbates the mucositis.</p>
<p>Oral mucositis is classified in four degrees of severity, with
    class 3 (only liquids can be swallowed) and class 4 (nothing
    can be swallowed) calling for immediate intervention by
    <a href="/help/non-oral-food">alternative feeding regimes</a>, if not hospitalisation.
        There is an ongoing debate about these approaches, about
        the optimal overall duration, various kinds and different
        starting points of such feeding interventions.</p>
<h1 id="vesiculo-bullous-lesions-blisters">Vesiculo-bullous lesions (blisters)</h1>
<p>These are technically slightly different lesions from ulcers.
    Ulcers are lesions of the mucous membrane, small (vesicles)
    and large (bullae) blisters are lesions of the epithelium
    (made up by superficial cells of the thin surface lining
    tissue). Blisters can either interrupt the adhesion between
    epithelial cells (intraepithelial blisters) or detach the
    epithelial layer from its underlying tissue (subepithelial
    blisters). These intraepithelial and subepithelial blisters
    / lesions are by and large oral manifestations of a number
    of different underlying diseases (see below), with the important
    exception of the spontaneous formation of oral blood blisters
    of unknown cause (angina bullosa haemorrhagica, these are
    irritating but benign in nature).</p>
<h1 id="persistent-patches-and-lesions">Persistent patches and lesions</h1>
<p>A number of persistent white (leukoplakia), red (erythroplakia)
    and speckled (erythroleukoplakia) patches, submucous fibrosis
    (scar tissue formation beneath the mucosa) and a rare variant
    of lichen planus (see below) all belong to a group of oral
    lesions that are associated with variable degrees of abnormal
    cell growth (dysplasia) and a possibility for malignant transformation
    of the lesion. These lesions are therefore sometimes called
    premalignant lesions; we discuss dysplasia in a separate
    section:</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to read more about so called premalignant lesions
        and underlying abnormal cell growth (dysplasia), this
        information is on our pages about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">dysplasia</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p><strong>Lichen planus</strong> is a common skin condition (estimated
    1 % of the world population), thought to be an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">immune disorder</a>.
    It is an itchy non-infectious rash mostly affecting people
    older than 40 years, women are more often affected than men.
    Approximately in half of the cases not only the skin but
    also the oral mucosa is affected. Lichen planus may exclusively
    affect the oral mucosa.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis-list-oral-mucosal-lesion-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Lichen planus of the skin.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Oral lichen planus typically exhibits white or reddish lace-like
    patterns on the surface of the tongue or inner cheek; if
    ulcers develop these may be painful. A <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>    may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A rare (approximately
    1 %) sub-variant of oral lichen planus, erosive lichen planus
    (see Figure 4), is thought to belong to the group of potentially
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">premalignant lesions</a>    whereas for the more common forms no such association is
    known. Oral lichen planus may persist for many months or
    years.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> An example of oral erosive lichen
        planus.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Frictional keratosis</strong> is characterised by white
    patches caused by some minor local trauma, such as ill-fitting
    dentures or a sharp tooth.</p>
<p><strong>Smoker’s keratosis</strong> are white patches caused
    by irritation by chemicals in <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">tobacco smoke</a>.
     </p>
<h1 id="oral-cancer">Oral cancer</h1>
<p>The majority of oral mucosal lesions are benign, but it is definitely
    a good idea to carefully check any persistent lesions in
    order to exclude malignancy. That may require taking a
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>.</p>
<aside>
    <p>The <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">diagnosis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer">treatment</a>        of oral cancers as well as an overview of <a href="/treatment/timelines/cancer/mouth-cancer">timelines and outcomes</a>        are described in our dedicated sections about oral cancer.</p>
</aside>
<h1 id="oral-mucosal-lesions-related-to-other-diseases">Oral mucosal lesions related to other diseases</h1>
<p>Many non-oral diseases have oral manifestations; these can be
    early or late signs and symptoms of other diseases. If oral
    manifestations happen to be an early sign of some other disease,
    it can (and does) happen that this disease gets initially,
    or tentatively, diagnosed in a maxillofacial clinic.</p>
<p>Apart from a wide range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>    (see above), in particular many skin diseases, haematological
    (blood) disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal system
    lead to oral manifestations.</p>
<p><strong>Skin diseases</strong> with oral manifestations include</p>
<ul>
    <li>lichen planus (see above);</li>
    <li>dyskeratosis congenita (rare inherited condition, leading
        to bone marrow failure; oral <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysplasia">leukoplakia</a>        and <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>        common);</li>
    <li>dermatomyositis (inflammatory condition affecting muscles
        and skin; may cause mouth ulcers or inflammation of gums);</li>
    <li>systemic lupus erythematosus (systemic autoimmune disorder,
        may give rise to mouth ulcers or rashes);</li>
    <li>pemphigus (rare chronic skin disorder, probably an autoimmune
        condition, that causes blisters and sores of skin and
        oral (and genital) mucosa);</li>
    <li>dermatitis herpetiformis (chronic inflammatory condition
        that affects skin and mucosa; leads to blisters);</li>
    <li>epidermolysis bullosa (group of skin and connective tissue
        disorders, large blisters as oral manifestation, may
        cause <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing difficulties</a>,
        <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">caries</a> a common
        problem);</li>
    <li>erythema multiforme (immunological skin reaction to mostly
        infections or medications, tends to include oral blisters);</li>
    <li>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (rare inherited connective tissue
        disorder, <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>        and bleeding of oral mucosa common);</li>
    <li>Darier’s disease (rare inherited skin condition, papules
        and white patches on gums and palate).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haematological disorders</strong> with oral manifestation
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>anaemia (caused by nutritional deficiencies (mainly iron,
        vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folic acid), recurrent oral
        ulcers);</li>
    <li>haematological malignancies (different forms of leukaemia,
        lymphoma and myeloma) typically have a range of oral
        manifestations. This is discussed in our section about
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">haematological malignancies</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gastrointestinal disorders</strong> with oral manifestations
    include</p>
<ul>
    <li>coeliac disease (commonly known as gluten intolerance; may
        cause recurrent oral ulcers alongside sore tongue and
        lips);</li>
    <li>ulcerative colitis (long-term inflammation of intestines
        with mostly gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, but
        may include oral lesions and lumps);</li>
    <li>Crohn’s disease (inflammatory bowel disease of unknown cause;
        may affect all parts of gastrointestinal tract, including
        mouth ulcers).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other conditions</strong> with oral manifestations include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Behçet’s disease (rare systemic inflammatory condition of
        the blood vessels; amongst many other signs and symptoms,
        most common painful mouth ulcers);</li>
    <li>renal failure (may cause white oral patches);</li>
    <li>allergies (offenders include dental materials, a wide variety
        of foods and a wide range of drugs (see below)).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="oral-mucosal-lesions-related-to-drugs">Oral mucosal lesions related to drugs</h1>
<p>The list of <a href="/treatment/other/medication">medicinal</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/drugs">recreational drugs</a> causing,
    for example, difficulties with dry mouth, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>    is long and essentially includes every type and class of
    drug. Similarly, the list of drugs giving rise to other oral
    lesions is also long and varied, below some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pigmented patches – often caused by recreational drugs, including
        <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/overview">coffee/tea, paan, nicotine</a>,
        especially in conjunction with suboptimal <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>,
        chlorhexidine (mouthwash);</li>
    <li>chemical burns – what it says on the tin, harm caused by
        direct contact of mucosa with strongly acidic or other
        chemically reactive substances; misguided use of aspirin
        tablets (pressed against aching tooth), trichloroacetic
        acid (haemostatic and etching agent used in dental practice),
        sodium hypochlorite (bleaching agent, widely used in
        root canal treatment) and phenol (component in some mouth
        rinses) can cause such lesions;</li>
    <li>serious oral ulcerations and/or agranulocytosis (agranulocytosis
        is an acute and serious lack of particular white blood
        cells, with high risk of serious infections and causes
        severe oral ulcerations) – drugs suppressing bone marrow
        function, phenytoin (anti-epileptic drug), <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">chloramphenicol</a>        (antibacterial agent), <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles">cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, busulfan and other chemotherapy drugs</a>,
        captopril (anti-hypertension drug) can cause agranulocytosis
        and/or other forms of severe oral ulcerations;</li>
    <li>exfoliative stomatitis (oral manifestation of skin-shedding
        as a drug reaction) – this potentially serious drug reaction
        has been associated with gold drugs (arthritis treatment),
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterials</a>        (sulphonamides, penicillin and its derivatives, isoniazid),
        blood pressure medications (Ca channel blockers), anti-epileptic
        drugs (phenytoin and others), barbiturates (sedation)
        and a number of topical medications;</li>
    <li>gingival hyperplasia (enlargement of the gums) – Ca channel
        blockers (anti-hypertensive, blood-pressure lowering
        drugs) and phenytoin (anti-epileptic drug) common offenders;</li>
    <li>allergies with oral manifestations – common offenders amongst
        systemically administered drugs are some antibacterial
        agents, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">β-lactams</a>        (penicillin and its derivatives) and some <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">analgesics (NSAIDS)</a>;
        locally common offenders are components of toothpastes,
        in particular benzoates (preservatives), sodium lauryl
        sulphate (foaming agent) and artificial flavourings.</li>
</ul>
