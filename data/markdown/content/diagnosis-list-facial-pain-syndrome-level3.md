<h1 id="classification-of-facial-pain-syndromes">Classification of facial pain syndromes</h1>
<p>Idiopathic (unknown cause) facial pain makes up a significant
    proportion of oral and maxillofacial practice. In 1994 the
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/further-reading">International Association for the Study of Pain</a>    revised its classification of chronic pain. This now includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dental-type pain</li>
    <li>Odontalgia (toothache!)</li>
    <li>Pulpitis (inflammation of the dental pulp)</li>
    <li>Periapical periodontitis and dental <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a></li>
    <li>Atypical odontalgia (toothache, in the absence of detectable
        dental disease)</li>
    <li>Cracked tooth syndrome</li>
    <li>Glossodynia (also known as ‘burning mouth syndrome’ or
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">oral dysaesthesia</a>)</li>
    <li>Trigeminal herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia</li>
    <li>Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux)</li>
    <li>Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (affecting tongue and throat)</li>
    <li>Secondary neuralgia (from central nervous system lesions)</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">Temporomandibular joint (jaw joint) pain dysfunction syndrome</a></li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">Rheumatoid arthritis of the temporomandibular joint</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Idiopathic facial pain is a very real entity and not just a manifestation
    of psychological problems, although they are sometimes associated.
    All forms should remain a ‘diagnosis of exclusion’ (that
    is, all other causes of facial pain, notably arising from
    the teeth, sinuses, neuralgias and headaches should be considered
    and if necessary investigated). A thorough <a href="/diagnosis/tests/medical-history">medical history</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/examination">examination</a>    needs to include examination of the cranial nerves. In selected
    cases <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a> or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri">MRI</a>    scans may be necessary to exclude serious pathology. This
    is important as vague pain can on occasion be a symptom of
    a life-threatening disease, particularly when conventional
    treatments fail. Periodic reassessment is also advisable
    for this reason. Occasionally some forms of idiopathic facial
    pain (for example, oral <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">dysaesthesia</a>    ) are associated with deficiencies in iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>    or folic acid.</p>
<h1 id="aetiology">Aetiology</h1>
<p>It has been suggested that facial-pain symptoms may be interrelated
    and form part of a whole body pain syndrome involving the
    neck, back, abdomen and skin. Adverse life events, ‘stress’
    and impaired coping ability are the strongest known associated
    factors.</p>
<p>The aetiology of idiopathic facial pain is (by definition) unknown
    - the physiology of pain is very complicated. In <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome</a>    evidence suggests that stress-induced inflammation within
    and around the joint can cause local production of various
    chemicals, including free radicals, which results in pain
    and in possibly destructive changes to the joint. Some of
    these chemicals may also develop in muscles and teeth, accounting
    for the different anatomical locations for pain. Neuropeptides
    have been demonstrated within the temporomandibular joint
    capsule. Free radicals, in addition to causing pain, may
    also have an effect on the synovial fluid (lubricating fluid
    in the joint), impairing its lubricating ability and resulting
    in adhesions across the joint. Other pain mediating agents
    (including 15-hydroxyeicosatraeinoic acid, 15-HETE, and ‘substance
    P’, a neuropeptide) have been identified. It has been suggested
    that these chemicals may be present in other nerve endings,
    which may help to account for dental-type pain in the absence
    of obvious dental disease (odontalgia; see below).</p>
<h1 id="atypical-facial-pain">Atypical facial pain</h1>
<p>This is pain which does not fit into any other diagnostic categories
    (such as diseases of the teeth, sinuses, ear, jaw joint,
    etc.). It is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion.</p>
<p>Atypical facial pain is often characterised by its bizarre and
    inconsistent nature. Symptoms may be related to those of
    atypical odontalgia (see below) which, it has been suggested,
    is a localised variant of atypical facial pain. It may be
    described as an intense, deep, constant burning or aching
    pain. It is usually difficult to localise the pain. As a
    rule of thumb, organic pain (due to infection, trauma, tumours,
    nerve irritation etc.) does not cross the midline of the
    face. Despite the severity of the symptoms, patients are
    not kept awake at night by the pain. Other symptoms (such
    as dysaesthesia (distorted sensation), paraesthesia (lack
    of sensation), tingling and numbness may be experienced.
    There has to be careful assessment to make sure there is
    no underlying disease such as multiple sclerosis or tumours.
    Similar to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome</a>,
    stress, anxiety and depression are often associated with
    atypical facial pain.</p>
<h1 id="trigeminal-neuralgia">Trigeminal neuralgia</h1>
<p>Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is described as ‘a painful
    unilateral affliction of the face, characterised by brief
    electric shock-like (lancinating) pains, limited to the distribution
    of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve’. Typically
    it occurs in middle aged and elderly patients. The second
    and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve (mainly in the
    region of the upper and lower jaws) are usually affected.
    Episodes may occur occasionally or frequently over several
    weeks to months, often followed by pain-free intervals. Patients
    describe the pain as like a sudden electric shock, frequently
    triggered by trivial stimuli of the face, such as with washing,
    shaving, chewing and talking. It may also occur spontaneously.</p>
<h1 id="other-facial-pain-syndromes">Other facial pain syndromes</h1>
<h2>Odontalgia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Short-lasting diffuse pain resulting from dentinoenamel (dental
        enamel) defects and evoked by local stimuli.</li>
    <li>Sharp or dull, mild to moderate pain lasting less than a
        second to minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pulpitis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pain resulting from pulpal inflammation, that is evoked by
        local stimuli.</li>
    <li>Sharp, dull ache, or throbbing pain, moderate to severe,
        lasting minutes or hours, with episodes that may continue
        for several days.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Periapical periodontitis and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Severe throbbing pain arising from the periodontal tissues.</li>
    <li>Continuous, mild to intense aching, especially after hot
        or cold stimuli, that may last a few minutes to several
        hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Atypical odontalgia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Severe throbbing pain in the tooth without major pathology.</li>
    <li>Often described as severe continual throbbing in teeth and
        gingivae (gums). It may vary from mild to intense pain,
        especially with hot or cold stimuli. It may be widespread
        or well localised, frequently precipitated by a dental
        procedure and may move from tooth to tooth. It may last
        a few minutes to several hours.</li>
    <li>Atypical odontalgia may be a symptom of psychosis or depression,
        and there is often excessive concern with oral hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Glossodynia and sore mouth (also known as ‘burning mouth syndrome’
    or ‘oral dysaesthesia’)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Burning pain in the tongue or mucous membranes.</li>
    <li>Burning, tender, nagging pain, usually constant, but may
        be variable, and increasing in intensity from morning
        to evening; occasionally associated with iron, vitamin
        B<sub>12</sub> or folate deficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cracked tooth syndrome</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Brief sharp pain in a tooth, due to cusp (grinding surface)
        flexion and ‘microleakage’.</li>
    <li>Moderate pain on biting that lasts a few seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trigeminal herpes zoster</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Acute herpetic infection in the cranial nerve V (the trigeminal
        nerve).</li>
    <li>Burning, tingling pain with occasional lancinating components
        felt in the skin. Pain may precede or follow herpetic
        eruptions and last from one week to several weeks.</li>
    <li>Spontaneous permanent remission is common, although the condition
        may progress to chronic (postherpetic) neuralgia (see
        below).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Postherpetic neuralgia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Chronic pain with skin changes in the distribution of the
        cranial nerve V following acute herpes zoster.</li>
    <li>Burning, tearing, itching dysaesthesia and crawling dysaesthesias
        in skin of affected areas of moderate intensity; exacerbated
        by mechanical contact. May last for several years, spontaneous
        subsidence is not uncommon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secondary neuralgia from central nervous system lesions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Pains in the distribution of one or more branches of the
        cranial nerve V resulting from a recognised lesion (such
        as a tumour, multiple sclerosis, aneurysm (swelling of
        an artery wall)).</li>
    <li>May be indistinguishable from trigeminal neuralgia (see above)
        or be a constant, severe dull pain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Glossopharyngeal (affecting tongue and throat (pharynx)) neuralgia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sudden, severe, brief stabbing recurrent pains in the distribution
        of the glossopharyngeal nerve.</li>
    <li>Sharp, stabbing bouts of severe pain felt deep in throat
        or ear, often triggered by touch or swallowing and by
        ingestion of cold fluids. Episodes may interfere with
        eating and can last for weeks to several months and subside
        spontaneously. Recurrence is common.</li>
    <li>Needs to be distinguished from Eagle’s syndrome (caused by
        an elongated or misshapen styloid process (a pointed
        piece of bone just below the ear), and/or calcification
        of the stylohyoid ligament).</li>
</ul>
