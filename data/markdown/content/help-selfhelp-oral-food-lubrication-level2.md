<p>Eating difficulties caused by severe forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>    are a common cause of misery for maxillofacial patients,
    especially for people who underwent <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy treatment</a>    in the head and neck region. Unfortunately, these difficulties
    often persist for a considerable period of time, and in some
    cases become a permanent problem. Artificial saliva usually
    does not solve eating problems of this kind. Using large
    amounts of water to literally wash food down helps but only
    goes so far - having to forcefully wash down food certainly
    does not create a pleasant eating experience.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about artificial saliva,
        there is more information on our detailed page about
        <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">saliva and eating</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>For some people it may be sufficient to mainly eat moist foods
    and use lots of <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">sauce(s)</a>    with all meals, combined with drinking lots of water. For
    others slightly more engineering is needed to make meals
    more manageable and more enjoyable. Depending on the exact
    nature of some <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing problems</a>,
    it may be better to keep the texture of a lubricant completely
    smooth and fairly thick, while others will prefer a slightly
    thinner lubricant with soft but textured food, and so on.</p>
<p>We use the term engineering here because the <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">mechanisms of swallowing</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">problems with swallowing</a>    when some components in the process fail can explain which
    textures and lubricant consistencies are likely to work best.
    In addition, the mechanisms of the following two, fairly
    general food lubrication tricks are fully explained by the
    underlying chemical and physical principles and are based
    on the current understanding of how <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">saliva enables chewing, eating and swallowing</a>.</p>
<p>We will have a look at the effects of a natural emulsifier and
    a gelling agent and how this can explain their roles as lubricants.
    Please do remember – lubricating your food is not the same
    as diluting it with plenty of liquid but rather aims to achieve
    an overall smooth and sufficiently slippery bolus that will
    be easy to swallow, similar to the consistency of a food
    bolus produced with the help of natural saliva.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about how saliva enables
        eating and swallowing, there is more information on our

<h1 id="emulsifying-agents">Emulsifying agents</h1>
<p>The following is actually a story of the power of ‘citizen science’
    and communication in making sense of what people report repeatedly
    and independently of each other. Time and again, people afflicted
    by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth problems</a>    report that (non-sugary) proper old-fashioned custard is
    a great lubrication agent and helps with eating in general,
    savoury as well as sweet foods. Hearing all these reports
    one is initially tempted to think that this is simply due
    to the fact that custard is such a well-established comfort
    food and comes with a lovely non-aggressive taste as well
    as a vanilla flavour that we can notice by its smell rather
    than its taste. While that is surely part of its success
    it is only part of the story.</p>
<p>There is the odd report where people mention that they find off-the-shelve
    commercial salad cream useful as a lubricant for everything,
    including chocolate cake. One is initially tempted to ascribe
    such reports to the ingenuity and inventiveness of people
    in overcoming difficulties – if taste is disturbed anyway,
    why not use salad cream for lubricating everything, if it
    works.</p>
<p>Eventually, the detective instincts kick in and the question
    cannot be ignored any longer: What actually do custard and
    commercial salad cream have in common, if anything? Obviously
    they do have in common that both lubricate a range of foods
    reasonably well. And they have in common that both contain
    an emulsifier. Proper custard is made with egg yolks, egg
    yolks in turn contain lecithin, a natural emulsifier. Commercial
    salad cream needs to be stabilised for a prolonged shelve
    life and to prevent it from splitting. That is achieved by
    adding an emulsifier to the preparation, either lecithin
    (in this case more likely derived from soy beans rather than
    from egg yolk) or some other powerful thickener such as xanthan
    gum.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you'd like to know more about thickeners and other
        texture modifying agents, there is more information on
        our page about <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">food texture modifiers</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Statherin, one of the proteins in natural saliva, relevant for
    the <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">role of saliva in enabling eating, chewing and swallowing</a>,
    actually is another example of a naturally occurring emulsifier.
    Figure 1 compares the overall structures of these two different
    phospholipid molecules, statherin and lecithin. Phospholipid
    is the general name for molecules with a polar (phosphate
    group, attracting water and other polar molecules) end and
    a non-polar end opposite that tends to attract other non-polar
    molecules (such as a fat).</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/lubrication/level2/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A comparison of two different
        phospholipid molecules. Left: a representation of the
        <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">statherin molecule</a>        in its unfolded elongated conformation. Right: a representation
        of the main functional units of the lecithin molecule.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The left part of Figure 1 shows a sketch of the overall structure
    of a statherin molecule, the right part of Figure 1 depicts
    the overall structure of a lecithin molecule. Even if lecithin
    overall is a much larger molecule, the two compounds have
    identical functional units. These units enable both compounds
    to ‘wrap up’ and coat fatty (non-polar, hydrophobic) food
    particles in a watery environment to produce homogeneous
    emulsions. This versatile general function of phospholipids
    as emulsifiers is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/lubrication/level2/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> An illustration of the general
        functionality of phospholipids (and other emulsifiers)
        in homogenising otherwise immiscible water – fat mixtures.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This general functionality of phospholipids as emulsifiers explains
    well how lecithin (in egg yolks in custard…) can replace
    to some extent the lubricating function of one of the
    <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">components of saliva relevant for eating</a>, statherin,
        and thus can be instrumental in overcoming dry-mouth
        related eating problems.</p>
<p>In purely practical terms we can see that egg yolks will be a
    versatile (and nutritious) natural ‘additive’ to help with
    lubricating many foods. Egg yolks will give a silky and smooth
    consistency to many foods. For example, just add an egg yolk
    to vegetable soup before serving but do not boil the liquid
    anymore. The emulsifying properties of egg yolks are also
    responsible for the smooth and silky consistency of many
    home-made ice creams and other preparations such as custards
    or flans (baked custards).</p>
<h1 id="gelling-agents">Gelling agents</h1>
<p>Not only are <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">gelatin-based, melt-in-the-mouth jellies</a>    easy to eat in many circumstances, there are also reports
    that softly set, wobbly jellies act as good lubricating agents
    for a range of other foods. How and why does that work?</p>
<p>One of the proteins in saliva, <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">MUC5B</a>,
    is a rather large elongated molecule (see Figure 3, top).
    Due to its many polar side branches it can form very large
    aggregates by accommodating considerable amounts of water
    molecules (illustrated in Figure 3, middle). This is called
    gelling and is (one of) the mechanism that makes saliva a
    rather <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">sticky (non-Newtonian) liquid</a>.
    Sticky saliva is good at wetting all kinds of dry foods and
    contributes to the formation and transportation of a homogeneous
    and soft, easily swallowed bolus.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/lubrication/level2/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> An illustration of the general
        functionality of gelling agents. Top: the <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/detailed">MUC5B molecule</a>        in its elongated unfolded conformation. Middle: how MUC5B
        molecules form large aggregates and gels by taking up
        water molecules and swelling. Bottom: the same swelling
        mechanism allows the large chain-like protein molecules
        of <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">gelatin</a> to accommodate
        considerable quantities of water.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With too little saliva, or in the absence of natural saliva,
    water alone cannot make up for this wetting and lubricating
    role of the MUC5B protein when eating: water lacks this crucial
    not-quite-liquid texture for this particular task. However,
    pairing food with another jelly, very softly set and especially
    when made with ordinary gelatin, can partially compensate
    for this. The bottom part of Figure 3 illustrates the overall
    structure of gelatin: large, elongated protein molecules
    with polar sidechains which are able to accommodate large
    quantities of water molecules, altogether quite similar to
    the global structure and gelling mechanism observed in MUC5B.
    When soaking <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">gelling agents</a>    such as gelatin in water they will take up volumes of water
    multiple times their own volume (see Figure 4).</p>

<h1 id="a-few-general-comments-about-lubricating-foods">A few general comments about lubricating foods</h1>
<p>For most people with eating problems due to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>    the best way forward depends on the overall combination of
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">swallowing troubles</a>.
    The eating experience will usually benefit from a bit of
    exploration of the most suitable <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">texture and temperature of foods</a>    and <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">corresponding recipes</a>.
    This experimentation is best seen as an ongoing adventure
    as most dry mouth and other <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">other swallowing problems</a>    tend to change over time.</p>
<p>Apart from the two general food lubrication options (emulsifying
    and gelling agents) that we briefly discussed above, the
    best approach certainly depends strongly on personal taste
    and preferences, not just personal patterns of troubles.
    Potential lubricating agents range all the way from water
    to pure fat such as molten butter and everything inbetween.</p>
<aside>
    <p>A <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication/printable-grid.pdf">printable grid listing the whole range of potential lubricating agents can be found here</a>;
        use it to identify useful and non-working food/lubricant
        combinations.</p>
</aside>
<p>The printable grid (see above) lists a few columns for food categories
    that may need lubrication. It may be useful to find out (and
    remember) good combinations of foods and lubricants – and
    those that do not work well. Do work your way through the
    grid, including some combinations that may not look particularly
    convincing at a first glance, perhaps that turns out exactly
    the combination that works well for you for the time being.
    Even better, please do <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication/feedback">share your food lubrication experiences</a>:
    together we may discover more useful tricks and ideas about
    improving the eating experience with dry mouth.</p>
