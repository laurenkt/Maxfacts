<p>Surgical management of cysts is, by and large, some form of removal
    of the cyst.</p>
<p>Before this definitive surgical intervention, a decision has
    to be made if a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a>    beforehand is necessary or not. Preoperative histological
    diagnosis is an advantage in most cases. The problem is that
    even if performed under local anaesthesia, it subjects the
    patient to an unpleasant and potentially unnecessary second
    procedure. Clinically and radiologically unicystic lesions
    where the level of certainty of diagnosis is high can quite
    reasonably be treated primarily and the diagnosis confirmed
    postoperatively, accepting that very rarely a surprise diagnosis
    of keratocyst (see below), <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion">ameloblastoma</a>    or even a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">malignancy</a>    will occur. Equally, if there is a level of uncertainty with
    the diagnosis, a pre-definitive treatment biopsy is the sensible
    option.</p>
<p>Another consideration before definitive surgical treatment concerns
    anaesthesia. If the cyst is limited to the region of a single
    tooth, then treatment under local anaesthesia is usually
    adequate. Cysts in the posterior mandible and those spanning
    more than two or three teeth, as well as other extended cysts,
    are often better treated under general anaesthesia. These
    can only be approximate guidelines and the treatment plan
    should be tailored to the individual case, taking all other
    factors such as medical history, size and potential definitive
    diagnosis into account.</p>
<h1 id="epithelial-cysts-affecting-the-jaws">Epithelial cysts affecting the jaws</h1>
<p>As far as jaw cysts are concerned, there are essentially three
    surgical treatment options: enucleation (cystectomy), marsupialization
    (cystostomy), or slightly more aggressive forms of removal,
    limited resection, in some cases.</p>
<h2>Enucleation (cystectomy)</h2>
<p>Enucleation involves the stripping away of the cyst lining from
    the resorbed bony cavity, resulting in a clean ‘hole’ in
    the bone. This deficit is filled by blood which organises
    into osteoid and then into new bone. There has never been
    an evidence-based demonstration of need to graft or fill
    the defect with synthetic substances. A step by step illustration
    of the procedure is shown in Figures 1 to 6.</p>

</figure>
<h2>Marsupialization (cystostomy)</h2>
<p>Large cysts in which enucleation may result in extensive local
    damage or patients who are unfit for more extensive surgery
    can be managed by marsupialization. This involves exposing
    the cyst lining and removing a small window from the lining.
    This is then sutured to the mucosa. The cavity can then be
    packed with an antiseptic dressing and regularly changed
    as the cavity heals from underneath. A step by step illustration
    of the procedure is shown in Figures 7 to 9.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info/figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Marsupialization of a cyst that
        is in contact with the overlying mucosa. The area of
        mucosa to be excised is marked (in purple).</figcaption>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> The defect is packed with iodoform
        gauze. This allows gradual resolution of the defect as
        new bone displaces the cavity lining.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Decompression with oral grommets (tiny tubes) has been used in
    extremely frail patients. This procedure removes little or
    none of the cyst lining but places a small ‘ventilation tube’
    which seems to delay growth, or may even reduce the overall
    size of the cyst. This procedure is essentially palliative
    as no formal diagnosis is reached and the bone defect remains
    in adults. In children some compensatory growth can occur.</p>
<p>Enucleation or marsupialization are the usual methods of choice
    for removal of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>radicular cysts</li>
    <li>residual cysts</li>
    <li>dentigerous cysts</li>
    <li>eruption cysts</li>
    <li>nasopalatine cysts</li>
    <li>nasolabial cysts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limited resection</h2>
<p>Limited resection represents a more aggressive form of removal
    of a cyst in that it will include the removal of bone in
    the vicinity of the cyst (a modified enucleation). It may
    also be a rim resection of the mandible (where a considerable
    portion of the mandibular bone is removed but a thin rim
    of the mandible is preserved to provide continuity of the
    bone). Treatment with Carnoy’s solution (a mixture of 60%
    alcohol, 30% chloroform and 10% concentrated acetic acid;
    applied locally directly after enucleation of a keratocyst)
    is popular with some surgeons. This is a way to reduce recurrence
    of keratocysts: the epithelial lining in keratocysts is very
    friable and therefore difficult to remove completely.
    <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">Cryotherapy</a> (local use of low temperature) may also have
        a role. A resection procedure with a reinforcing reconstruction
        plate is illustrated in Figures 10 to 15.</p>

        position while it heals.</figcaption>

        the nerve bundle.</figcaption>

<p>Limited resection is a method for the removal of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>keratocysts / keratoystic odontogenic tumours (KOT)</li>
    <li>some aneurysmal bone cysts (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="nonepithelial-cysts-affecting-the-jaws">Nonepithelial cysts affecting the jaws</h1>
<h2>Aneurysmal bone cyst</h2>
<p>These are rare and different treatment methods have been advocated.
    Simple curettage (removing tissue by scraping or scooping)
    is usually all that is required. Some cases are complicated
    by severe bleeding and sudden enlargement. If this is the
    case the lesion may be very vascular and detailed investigations,
    including vascular studies, are advised. In these situations,
    limited resection is needed and curative.</p>
<h1 id="solitary-bone-cyst"><strong>Solitary bone cyst</strong></h1>
<p>These cysts often resolve spontaneously. However, the cavity
    is usually opened if only to confirm a diagnosis. Theoretically
    it could be healed by injecting the patients blood into the
    cyst to allow organization of clot into new bone.</p>
<h2>Stafne’s idiopathic (unknown cause) bone cavity</h2>
<p>No treatment is required.</p>
<h1 id="epithelial-cysts-affecting-mouth-neck-and-face-other-than-jaw">Epithelial cysts affecting mouth, neck and face (other than jaw)</h1>
<p>For these cysts affecting different areas of mouth, neck and
    face the usual preferred surgical approach is removal by
    complete excision.</p>
<p>Complete excision is the usual procedure for the removal of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>oral dermoid cysts</li>
    <li>angular dermoid cysts</li>
    <li>mucoceles</li>
    <li>ranulae</li>
    <li>branchial cysts</li>
</ul>

        being removed from beneath the sternomastoid</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Cystic hygroma / lymphangioma (neck and mouth)</h2>
<p>Surgical treatment of cystic hygroma (mostly in the neck) or
    lymphangioma (in the mouth) is usually by excision (picibanil
    injections into the cysts(s) can be an alternative: picibanil
    is a streptococcal antigen that causes selective fibrosis/sclerosis
    of lymphangiomas). Surgery is extremely difficult for microcystic
    lesions but comparatively simple for large, solitary macrocystic
    lymphangioma (the latter also happens to be easiest to sclerose
    with picinabil). Microcystic lymphangioma may require multiple
    excisions over many years.</p>
<h2>Thyroglossal duct cyst</h2>
<p>Excision of thyroglossal duct cysts requires the removal of the
    central portion of the hyoid bone to allow complete excision
    of the duct (see Figure 16).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info/figure18.jpg">

        cyst, including the tract and the central portion of
        the hyoid bone.</figcaption>
