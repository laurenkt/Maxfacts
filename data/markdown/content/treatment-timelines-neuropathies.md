<p>For someone who has suffered from, or undergone treatment for,
    a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">neuropathy</a>,
    however it has been caused, the process is frustrating.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the unpleasant sensations, which are by
    definition subjective, are awful. Unfortunately, there are
    no signs of this, no visible markers of what that person
    is undergoing and no real objective measures of the experience,
    although <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">pain scales</a>    do exist.</p>
<p>This adds an additional burden – no-one else can really see or
    share the experience.</p>
<p>In addition, the time taken for nerves to repair or at least
    heal to the closest they will return to normal, takes around
    18 months. This may be sooner as it depends on <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">axons (nerve connections)</a>    growing back along the tunnels the macroscopic nerve forms.
    But if function has not returned at 18 months after injury
    or treatment, then this is likely to be the final result.</p>
<p>In this instance, the most important factor is individual resilience
    and learning to live with an unpleasant condition and not
    allow it to control one’s existence.</p>
