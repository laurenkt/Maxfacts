<p>Many treatments for temporomandibular (TMJ) joint disorders are
    available. None of these have been consistently shown to
    be superior to the others. Often the clinical course does
    not reflect a progressive disease. Then the main goals of
    treatment are to reduce or eliminate pain, joint noises and
    to restore normal function. This is best achieved when contributing
    factors such as stress, depression and contributing habits
    (such as bruxism (teeth grinding)) are also addressed. Some
    patients will benefit from <a href="/help/mental-health">psychotropic medication and/or psychotherapy</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that many people afflicted by ‘TMJ
    problems’ have <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/facial-pain-syndrome">dysfunction of the muscles of mastication</a>    (chewing muscles) as a secondary manifestation of psychosocial
    conditions and the effect on the jaw joint itself is tertiary.
    All three components (muscle pain, disc dysfunction in the
    jaw joint, and psychological aspects) are commonly seen in
    the same patient. This is, obviously, an important factor
    in identifying optimal treatment strategies.</p>
<p>Only a small proportion of cases of jaw joint disorders benefits
    from surgery, about 1 in 20 cases. There are a range of surgical
    approaches currently used. These are more useful for patients
    suffering from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-joint">internal derangement</a>    with severe chronic pain, or for cases with significant symptoms
    of mechanical dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint.</p>
