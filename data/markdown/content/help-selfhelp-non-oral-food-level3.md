<p>Thinking about enteral feeding needs consideration of
    food in a wider sense, nutrition, complete and balanced
    diets, general well-being - in some ways similar to all
    these aspects when thinking about <a href="/help/oral-food">oral food intake</a>, though
    with some distinct differences. A slightly more in-depth
    discussion of these aspects, of advantages and
    disadvantages of different options, seems reasonable.
    Understanding how feeding tubes are placed and that
    replacing an existing tube is a straightforward
    intervention may be useful and/or reassuring. Finally, a
    rare and very specific risk for metastasis from head
    &amp; neck malignancies associated with gastrostomy is
    described.</p>
<h1 id="some-general-aspects-of-tube-feeding-with-commercial-formulae">Some general aspects of tube feeding with commercial
    formulae</h1>
<p>The following is concerned with the advantages and
    disadvantages of commercial formulae for tube feeding in
    terms of tolerance, nutrition and daily routines; it
    applies to all types of feeding tubes.</p>
<p>The <strong>advantages of commercial formulae</strong>
    for tube feeding are primarily the ease of use and
    ticking all the boxes for the quantities of <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">macro- and
        micronutrients</a> to fulfil nutrition requirements.
    Nobody will starve when relying on feeding with
    commercial formulae. Commercial formulae can be used for
    all types of feeding schemes and work for bolus feeding
    as well as for slow-drip feeding with or without a pump.
    This is important from a practical point of view: if too
    much food is given too fast, for some this may lead to
    vomiting or aspiration. Commercial formulae are designed
    to be dense in calories and other macronutrients, with a
    near-liquid consistency such that the formation of
    blockages should be minimised (but still this is a
    common event; feeding tubes tend to have a small
    diameter), all with a view to ease and convenience of
    use.</p>
<p>There is a price for the convenience of use, a long list
    of common adverse effects and intolerances. All of these
    are related to the composition of formulae, their single
    biggest <strong>disadvantage</strong>, and a simple fact
    about the functioning of our digestive systems. Nature
    has not foreseen that we feed our body on a non-varied
    diet of highly concentrated, highly processed and high
    sugar-density concoctions. Our bodies are not made to
    digest small volumes of extremely sugar-rich liquids as
    their main supply of food. Hence, digestive problems are
    commonly encountered with commercial formulae, including
    nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating,
    indigestion and reflux. Typically, it is necessary to
    use medications to counteract such effects (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antacid">antacids</a>
    to counteract indigestion and reflux symptoms,
    antiemetics to combat vomiting, electrolytes to maintain
    balance, etc).</p>
<p>Compositions of commercial formulae are all similar
    variations of the same theme, with some preparations
    designed to be easier to digest, and some preparations
    supposedly more useful to feed people with diabetes.
    Common components of commercial formulae are</p>
<ul>
    <li>carbohydrates - corn starch and corn syrup, simple
        sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) and sugar
        polymers (such as maltodextrin), sugar alcohols
        (such as xylitol);</li>
    <li>fats - various mono-, di- and triglycerides, fish
        oils, plant-derived oils from soy beans, corn,
        rapeseed, sunflower, palm oils);</li>
    <li>proteins - soy-derived products, cow milk
        derivatives (casein, whey proteins (lactalbumin));
    </li>
    <li>micronutrients - vitamins, minerals and other trace
        elements.</li>
</ul>
<aside>
    <p>There is more information about macro- and
        micronutrients on our pages about <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">nutrition</a>.
    </p>
</aside>
<p>Standard formulae are made up from slightly varied
    recipes of the above components. It is interesting to
    note that most of these ingredients are extremely cheap.
    If somebody is feeding exclusively on commercial
    formulae, high sugar contents of the order of 4 to 5
    times daily recommendations for glucose invariably lead
    to constant elevated blood sugar levels or intense
    glycaemic spikes, depending on the feeding schemes used.
    So called elemental formulae follow slightly different
    recipes and slightly different mixes of components,
    designed for easier digestion. Elemental formulae tend
    to have a slightly lower fat content and most of the
    protein components are hydrolysed (broken down) or
    sometimes are added in the form of amino acids. Special
    formulae for diabetic people are on offer, with lower
    carbohydrate / sugar and higher fat content than
    standard formulae. The carbohydrates in these
    formulations tend to have slightly higher glycaemic
    indices and thus are a little less likely to trigger
    intense blood glucose spikes. Despite these slightly
    less unhealthy formulations, it can be difficult to feed
    diabetic people in this way and to manage their often
    complicated dietary needs, especially avoiding hyper-
    and/or hypoglycaemic crises when juggling tube feeding
    with insulin dosage.</p>
<p>Another common reason for the need to use special
    formulae are allergic reactions to standard formulae.
    Many of the usual main components of commercial formulae
    are common food allergens, including products
    manufactured from soy, cow milk, wheat or corn. It is
    difficult to avoid allergens on a commercial formula
    diet, which in part may explain some of the common and
    the more serious intolerances to formulae.</p>
<p>There does not seem to be much systematic research into
    the long-term health effects of commercial-formulae
    based diets. It would be surprising if the effects of
    unhealthy and non-nutritious components and
    concentrations of components in formulae would have
    different effects from those of a similarly unhealthy
    diet taken orally (such as increased risk to develop
    diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or liver damage).</p>
<p>Perhaps the best use one can make of commercial formulae
    is as a short-term staple diet to bridge the time until
    returning to oral food. For long-term tube feeding, the
    best use of commercial formulae is probably to use them
    as a supplement to good quality, however <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">texture-modified</a>,
    oral food. Partial tube feeding can be a useful
    fall-back option when it is just too much hard work to
    eat enough by mouth to maintain body weight (begging the
    question, though, what the nutritional benefits are from
    eating empty sugar calories). Some people report that
    they use the sugar rush from formula as a wake-up-call,
    lazy breakfast option. For those who can eat by mouth,
    even if with difficulties, there are tasty ways to
    maximise the energy / calorie and nutrition content of
    oral foods without all the extra-sugar.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If youâ€™d like to read more about special oral foods,
        or would like some inspiration from a large <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">collection of
            recipes</a> , this information and more is on
        our pages on <a href="/help/oral-food">oral food
            intake</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Clever, and usually quite straightforward oral food
    preparations can help to minimise the need for formula
    and tube feeding for many people. If the individually
    best feeding regime is a combination of some proportion
    of oral food intake and tube feeding, the most sensible
    approach is to eat as much enjoyable food as possible by
    mouth and cherish the <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste and smell of the
        food</a> (whatever suits best), and only fill
    remaining intake gaps with formula tube feeding.</p>
<p>When oral food intake is not an option at all, some
    people will have to rely on a formulae-based diet. This
    typically occurs when somebody is unable or unwilling to
    deal with alternatives such as blended liquid diets (see
    below), or has no support with such alternative
    preparations, or if such alternative tube feeds are less
    well tolerated than a formulae-based diet. Also, in a
    care-institution setting it is likely that only formula
    feeding is provided</p>
<p>General good practice when dealing with formulae tube
    feeding has excellent <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral
        hygiene</a> as a high priority, especially if
    somebody is on a nil-by-mouth regimen. Under these
    conditions the normal oral self-cleaning mechanisms are
    severely impaired and the risk to acquire infections is
    enhanced. Further hygiene considerations include
    meticulous hand hygiene and cleanliness of all
    tube-feeding equipment, as well as prompt handling of
    formulae. Commercial formulae are sterile while in the
    unopened container. However, once opened their high
    concentrations of nutrients and especially sugars make
    them marvellous breeding grounds for bacteria. Watching
    out for signs of rare significant complications is
    advised. Significant complications include serious
    gastric haemorrhages, major tube leakages, infections,
    and aspiration with the risk to develop pneumonia. It is
    a good idea to keep some kind of <a href="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-nutrition-level2-diary-printable.pdf">food
        diary</a> so that any unmet nutritional needs can be
    spotted early.</p>
<h1 id="home-made-blended-liquid-diet-for-tube-feeding">Home-made, blended liquid diet for tube feeding</h1>
<p>Blended liquid diets are an alternative for many, but not
    for all who rely on tube feeding. For this to be a good
    alternative, some willingness to engage with aspects of
    <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">nutrition and
        balanced healthy diets</a>, cooking and taking back
    control of oneâ€™s everyday life are essential.
    Considering blended liquid diets is probably mainly
    relevant for medium- to long-term enteral feeding.</p>
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of blended liquid diets,
    prepared from home-made â€˜realâ€™ foods apply to all types
    of feeding tubes. Again, just like with the discussion
    of commercial formulae (see above), the following
    discussion concentrates on aspects of tolerance,
    nutrition and daily routines. Currently there is
    something of a rediscovery of blended liquid diet tube
    feeding, with some advocating it passionately and others
    less so. Increased advocating of blended liquid diets
    can be explained by the numerous unpleasant and adverse
    effects of commercial formulae (see above), as well as
    by the fact that more people live longer with conditions
    where long-term tube feeding is required. For the
    moment, there is a lack of sound evidence about
    advantages and disadvantages as well as the long-term
    effects, quite like the lack of robust information about
    commercial formulae.</p>
<p>The practicalities of a blended liquid diet suitable for
    tube feeding are straightforward and mainly involve a
    reasonably powerful blender or food processor and a
    couple of fine-meshed sieves. That is essentially the <a href="/help/oral-food/practical-tips">same kit as
        one needs to prepare texture-adapted, soft foods</a>
    for oral consumption. Any normal foods and mixtures of
    foods that add up to a balanced diet and can be finely
    blended / sieved are on the menu as long as they can be
    prepared as a thin smooth puree, or can be diluted to a
    consistency that will easily travel through the feeding
    tube and do not leave a sticky residue that would be
    difficult to flush out. Common sense is a vital
    ingredient here and is much supported by a transparent
    drinking straw for a test run, if in doubt. All other
    arguments are similar to those for preparing adapted
    oral foods, with one big difference: tube feeding does
    not provide a taste experience. A blended liquid diet
    typically works best as a bolus-feeding scheme rather
    than a more continuous drip feed.</p>
<p>The <strong>advantages of blended liquid diets</strong>
    cover several aspects of food intake. Technically, a
    blended liquid diet is the closest approximation of a
    normal, varied diet that would otherwise be taken by
    mouth. As the choice of ingredients is entirely under
    the control of the user, it is easy to avoid any
    allergens and other ingredients that give rise to
    digestive problems. As taste is not an issue with tube
    feeding, it is even easier to prepare varied healthy
    meals. If somebody is not convinced of the taste of
    broccoli, when blended with a tube-feeding meal this is
    not an issue. The feeding experience on blended
    liquefied meals is reported by users as much more
    natural and satisfying. Most users can tolerate a larger
    volume of a blended meal than of commercial formula.
    This is of practical importance in order to eat enough.
    A blended meal does not have the same density of
    calories as a commercial formula would, but that can be
    compensated for by a larger food volume (and be adding
    suitable nutritious components to the meal, rather than
    sugar).</p>
<p>Blended meals can return a sense of normality to
    somebodyâ€™s life, even if tube feeding is there to stay:
    blended meals take away some of the medicalisation of
    tube feeding. It makes a difference to be in control of
    everyday routines and to be able to take good care of
    oneself. It also makes a difference to essentially eat
    the same, or very similar, foods as the rest of the
    family and friends do. Strangely, the nutrition
    requirements of somebody relying on tube feeding with a
    blended diet have great potential as a learning
    experience and to get a whole family / group of friends
    to eat more balanced and healthy diets. Users of blended
    liquid diets have reported repeatedly that there are
    fewer problems with constipation (as blended whole foods
    have a larger volume and contain a good mixture of
    fibres), reflux and indigestion. There seems to be a
    generally improved tolerance of blended liquid diets as
    compared with commercial formulae, again repeatedly
    reported by users. Some users report improved skin and
    hair conditions when using a balanced blended diet. When
    there are opportunities to increase, over time, oral
    food intake, it is easier to do so when one is already
    in â€˜normal foodâ€™ mode.</p>
<p>The regularly quoted <strong>disadvantages of blended
        liquid diets</strong> for tube feeding are often
    perceived rather than factual, and/or can be easily
    avoided. Some feel that there is a risk of not meeting
    all nutritional needs with such a diet. That is easily
    mitigated by keeping a food diary and by becoming a
    little more knowledgeable about the components of a
    healthy diet â€“ knowledge that everybody should have
    anyway! This applies to macro- and micronutrients.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If youâ€™d like to read more about diets and nutrition,
        there is much information about these topics on our
        pages about <a href="/help/oral-food">oral food
            intake</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Some feel it is too much trouble. In fact, it is not a
    lot of extra-work, compared with managing tube feeding
    on commercial formulae. Batch cooking helps, especially
    when the collection of â€˜ready (proper) mealsâ€™ in the
    freezer starts growing after a few days, and blending a
    meal takes only seconds. An infection risk from the
    non-sterile home-cooked food is sometimes quoted (there
    is no evidence that the infection risk is higher than
    with commercial formulae). As long as decent normal
    kitchen and food hygiene is observed, there is not
    really any reason why there should be an increased risk
    of food poisoning. A reasonable additional precaution to
    prevent food poising is not to opt for extended periods
    of slow-drip feeding, but use bolus feeding instead.
    Another regularly raised concern is the risk for tube
    blockages. Blockages also occur when using commercial
    formulae. With blended diets, it is wise to avoid some
    known trouble makers, make extensive use of fine-meshed
    sieves to have a smooth preparation, and use a test run
    through a transparent drinking straw if in doubt.
    Careful flushing of the feeding tube with water before
    and after meals is another useful precaution.</p>
<p>General good practice when dealing with blended liquid
    diet tube feeding has excellent <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a> as a high
    priority, especially if somebody is on a nil-by-mouth
    regimen. Under these conditions the normal oral
    self-cleaning mechanisms are severely impaired and the
    risk to acquire infections is enhanced. Further hygiene
    considerations include meticulous hand hygiene and
    cleanliness of all tube-feeding equipment, as well as
    all the kitchen equipment and safe food storage.
    Watching out for signs of rare significant complications
    is advised. Significant complications include serious
    gastric haemorrhages, major tube leakages, infections,
    and aspiration with the risk to develop pneumonia. It is
    a good idea to keep some kind of <a href="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-nutrition-level2-diary-printable.pdf">food
        diary</a> so that any unmet nutritional needs can be
    spotted early. On a purely practical and purely
    empirical note, according to user reports some foods
    seem to be notoriously difficult to blend and liquefy
    properly, so should be avoided or only used in small
    amounts, and/or should be well diluted with a suitable
    liquid, and/or should always be passed through a
    fine-meshed sieve before feeding. These trouble makers
    include â€˜stickyâ€™ carbohydrates (potatoes and pasta in
    particular, which can also be difficult to eat by
    mouth), undercooked stringy vegetables and grains (such
    as green beans or celery), some seeds (including the
    small seeds in some berries, such as strawberries or
    blueberries).</p>
<h1 id="methods-to-insert-feeding-tubes">Methods to insert feeding tubes</h1>
<p>Techniques to insert fine bore nasogastric tubes are
    legion and many nurse specialists, junior and sometimes
    senior doctors have developed their own techniques. This
    is one approach that has worked. Remember gastrostomy
    tubes have higher complication rates.</p>
<p>Gloves and a pinafore (apron) of some description are a
    good idea. Explain the procedure to the patient and have
    them at 50 to 60 Â° upright, with neck in neutral
    position. Place a small amount of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">lidocaine
        gel</a> in the chosen nostril after ensuring it is
    patent (open). Keep a small drink of water handy. Select
    a tube; check the guidewire is lubricated and does not
    protrude. If a tracheostomy tube is present, the cuff
    should be deflated to allow passage of the tube.
    Lubricate the tube and introduce it into the nostril;
    pass it horizontally along the nasal floor. There is
    usually a little resistance as the tube reaches the
    nasopharynx; press past this and ask the patient to
    swallow (use the water if this helps). The tube should
    now pass easily down the oesophagus, entering the
    stomach at 40 cm. Secure the tube to the forehead with
    sticky tape and only now remove the guidewire, being
    careful to shield the patientâ€™s eyes. Inject air into
    the tube and listen for bubbling over the stomach.
    Confirm position with a chest radiograph (some systems
    require leaving a radio-opaque guidewire in prior to <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray/detailed">X-ray</a>
    investigation: check the tube you are using).</p>
<p>Potential problems and solutions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>nasal patency - select the least narrow nostril, use
        a lubricant, and, if necessary, a smaller tube and
        topical <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-vasoconstrictor-and-vasoldilator">vasoconstrictor</a>;
    </li>
    <li>gagging/vomiting - Not a problem in terms of
        insertion; and unpleasant as it sounds it is
        actually useful. All sphincters are open and the
        tube will pass quickly and easily;</li>
    <li>tube coiling into mouth - cooling the tube makes it
        more rigid and often helps. As a last resort, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">topical
            anaesthesia</a> and direct visualisation with a
        laryngoscope or nasendoscope, while an assistant
        passes the tube, may be necessary;</li>
    <li>tube pulled out by patient - if they
        <strong>must</strong> have the tube, consider a
        nasogastric tube â€˜bridleâ€™ designed for this problem
        or a stitch to the septum or soft tissue of the
        nose. This is not pleasant but is actually better
        for all concerned than constantly replacing a tube
        or the more invasive alternative â€“ gastrostomy;</li>
    <li>refeeding syndrome<i>â€‚-</i> patients who have been
        starved for more than five days and are then fed
        enterally or parenterally are at risk for this
        electrolyte and fluid imbalance characterised by
        severe hypophosphataemia (low levels of phosphates)
        with other biochemical disturbances. Â This can be
        avoided by supplementation with B vitamins and
        graded biochemical correction;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Percutaneous</strong> <strong>endoscopic
        gastrostomy</strong> <strong>(PEG)</strong>: the
    feeding tube is placed directly in the stomach through
    the abdominal wall at endoscopy. An endoscopistâ€™s area
    of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Radiologically inserted gastrostomy
        (RIG)</strong>: Â this is the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray</a> (or <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasound</a>)
    guided version of a PEG. It needs a nasogastric tube in
    place to inflate the stomach. A radiologistâ€™s area of
    expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Parenteral feeding</strong>: it is hazardous and
    expensive, and fortunately rarely necessary in
    maxillofacial surgery. Central or peripheral lines are
    required and need to be maintained. Parenteral feeding
    is neither as safe nor efficient as enteral feeding. It
    should be avoided if at all possible.</p>
<h1 id="specific-metastasis-risk-associated-with-gastrostomy">Specific metastasis risk associated with gastrostomy
</h1>
<p>There is a specific and unique issue with the placement
    of a gastrostomy in the context of head and neck
    malignancies. It has been known for approximately 30
    years that a small but significant risk exists for the
    (rare, estimated 0.5 to 3 %) seeding of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>
    from head and neck tumours at the gastrostomy site. The
    most common procedures to place a PEG involve the use of
    an endoscope and/or pushing /pulling along the mouth â€“
    oesophagus â€“ stomach line to place the tube securely
    without the need for open surgery. For a long time it
    was assumed that this placement method is the reason for
    this unique seeding of metastases at the PEG site, by
    enabling the mobilisation and transport of malignant
    cells from the mouth / throat to the stomach. It has
    been described as something akin to surgically
    transplanting malignant cells from one location to
    another. This hypothesis of direct seeding appears
    reasonable, especially if only a brief period of time
    elapses between PEG placement and a diagnosis of
    metastasis at the PEG site.</p>
<p>However, it has been established that a similar risk
    level for seeding of metastases at the PEG site exists
    for other surgical methods of PEG placement, where
    specifically any direct contact with malignant cells is
    avoided. These methods are rarely used, involve open
    surgery to the wall of the abdomen (and thus are
    associated with other morbidities), but completely omit
    any direct involvement of the mouth/throat/oesophagus
    passage during the PEG placement by using alternatives
    such as local radiological control of the tube
    insertion. Accordingly, the placement technique as such
    cannot be the main, or only, mechanism for the seeding
    of metastases.</p>
<p>Any mechanism that explains this unique PEG-site
    metastasis thus has to look beyond the mechanics of the
    tube-placement techniques. The usual <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases/more-info">haematogenous
        and/or lymphatic routes of spread of cancer
        cells</a> may well be in action but the relevance
    and role of these in this very specific and unique
    metastasis pattern are unclear. Current attempts to
    explain this form of metastasis consider the combined
    effects of several contributing factors in creating a
    favourable local environment at the PEG site for the
    establishment of metastases.</p>
<p>Some malignant cells may be naturally mobilised from the
    primary tumour and get swallowed, arriving in the
    stomach this way. In most circumstances, the strongly
    acidic stomach environment would not provide
    particularly favourable conditions for these cells to
    settle, survive and grow a new tumour. However, the PEG
    stoma is a permanent wound to which the body naturally
    reacts by <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammation</a>
    and locally increased circulation to provide a healing
    environment. This healing environment is also a more
    favourable environment for the establishment of
    metastatic cells. In addition, a common need to manage
    reflux and indigestion arising as a very common adverse
    effect of tube feeding (see above) by long-term use of
    powerful <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antacid">antacid
        medications</a>, in particular proton pump
    inhibitors, may well reinforce the mechanism by strongly
    lowering the acidity of the stomach environment. Much
    lower acidity combined with the effects of proton pump
    inhibitors on the mucosa of the stomach, could promote
    the survival of mobilised malignant cells, make it
    easier for these cells to adhere to the stomach wall and
    establish new growth.</p>
<p>It is also reasonable to assume that more than one factor
    is at play. It has been noted that the development of
    PEG-site metastases is often associated with the
    presence of other distant metastases from the primary
    tumour (approximately 50 %). One way to tentatively
    explain this finding would be to ascribe the entire
    course of events to a particularly aggressive tumour
    phenotype (the combined effects of the genetic
    characteristics of the tumour and the host environment).
    This would also explain the typically poor prognosis of
    such findings (although, by definition metastasis beyond
    the first echelon nodes (in the neck) has a dismal
    prognosis. If endoscope transfer was the reason for the
    secondary deposit, it could be considered a second
    primary rather than a metastasis but not if another
    mechanism is in effect). Clearly, a much better
    characterisation of tumour genetics will help to
    elucidate such mechanisms of tumour spread in general.
    Bizarrely, the unique and rare occurrence of PEG-site
    metastases from head and neck malignancies eventually
    may help to understand much more general aspects of
    tumour biology leading to the establishment of distant
    metastases.</p>
<p>From the current findings, it can be postulated
    reasonably that the method of PEG placement plays a less
    significant role than tumour biology. However, it is
    currently impossible to predict individual risk and/or
    to avoid the development of PEG-site metastases. It is,
    therefore, most important for patients, carers and
    clinicians to be vigilant and look out for any
    suspicious signs &amp; symptoms arising at the PEG site.
