<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">Damage
        affecting the cranial (head) and cervical (neck)
        nerves</a> is a hugely diverse range of conditions,
    with many different underlying causes. Yet, these
    diverse neuropathy conditions have many common aspects.
</p>
<p>Firstly, with nerve damage come signs and symptoms that
    can be extremely distressing.</p>
<p>Secondly, the spectrum of treatment modalities to deal
    with nerve damage is much less diverse:</p>
<ul>
    <li>for a fair number of neuropathies, treatment and
        resolution of the underlying condition also
        addresses, and often resolves, issues arising from
        accompanying nerve damage;</li>
    <li>medical management of neuropathies, particularly <a href="/treatment-other medication-pain-level2">underlying
            pathologies and dysfunctions</a> and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">options
            to moderate pain</a> is described on our pages
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">discussing
            pain</a>;</li>
    <li>surgical treatment of neuropathy is quite limited.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If abnormal sensation is a symptom after <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma to
        soft</a> and/or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">hard
        tissue</a> or surgical intervention and does not
    respond to non-invasive treatment after three months,
    surgical exploration and microscopic examination of the
    nerve is worthwhile. If the nerve is embedded in scar
    tissue, dissecting away the constricting scar tissue
    (neurolysis) can have astonishingly good results.</p>
<p>If the nerve has been partially cut, it can be
    microscopically repaired by direct suturing.</p>
<p>If it has been completely divided, then either excision
    of the scar at the ends of the nerve and mobilisation to
    reduce tension on the suture line and primary repair, or
    a graft using a short section of autologous (own body)
    nerve which has a tolerable donor site defect (for
    example, the sural nerve, a sensory nerve in the calf of
    the leg, or the greater auricular nerve from the front
    area of the ear) are established repair methods.
    Micro-surgical methods to repair nerve damage are
    described in more detail on the <a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies/more-info">following
        page</a>.</p>
<p>In experimental cases, using a variety of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/collagen">collagen</a>
    tunnels to attempt to regrow <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">axons</a>
    (nerve connections) across the divided nerve endings may
    improve matters.</p>
<p>It is vital to understand that once a nerve has been
    structurally damaged – even by compression or
    constriction – a full return to previous function is
    unlikely. The best results come with neurolysis. Direct
    suturing repair of a partially cut nerve may regain 80 %
    function, but a 50 to 60 % return to function for a
    completely divided nerve or a nerve graft would be
    regarded as an outstanding success.</p>
<p>With nerve damage and neuropathy treatment, keeping
    expectations realistic is essential.</p>
