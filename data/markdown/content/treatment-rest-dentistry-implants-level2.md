<p>Hundreds of thousands of dental implants are placed worldwide
    every year. They can be a great way to replace teeth, with
    some studies suggesting a survival rate of over 80 % at 16
    years. Implants are composed of a screw (often made from
    titanium), that is put in to the jaw bone, where the root
    of a tooth would normally be. Implants can be placed immediately
    after the removal or loss of a tooth, or after the healing
    process is complete. The best time to place an implant varies
    depending on different patient factors, so this is something
    which should be discussed at your consultation with your
    implant surgeon. Most implants are placed under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">local anaesthetic</a>    whilst you are awake, although some patients may have a
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">general anaesthetic</a> or sedation to enable treatment to
        be completed.</p>
<p>Once the screw is placed, a period of healing is usually required
    of around 6 months before the top of the tooth (crown) can
    be attached. During this time, you may be given a denture
    (some patients may refer to this as a ‘plate’), which is
    a removable tooth on an acrylic (plastic) plate as a temporary
    measure to disguise the gap.</p>
<p>In some cases, a crown can be placed immediately. The implant
    will fuse to the bone of the jaw, becoming firmer and more
    stable. Once the healing process is complete, it is likely
    the gum will have grown over the new implant (it is said
    to be osseointegrated). The implant is now in a position
    to function in the same way as a tooth root but only if it
    is loaded functionally in the same way as the tooth it is
    intended to replace. A little cut may be needed to expose
    the post, allowing for crown placement. Once exposed, the
    crown can be placed, which is the portion of the tooth above
    the gum line which can be seen inside the mouth. This part
    is usually made in a laboratory; however some dental clinics
    make them in-house. The shape of the tooth will be designed
    to fit in with the way you bite together and to suit the
    rest of your teeth. The colour is often an excellent match
    due to modern technology and materials.</p>
<p>Implants can still get disease around them as with natural teeth,
    especially if not maintained properly. Regular dental checks,
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">X-ray radiographs</a> and
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">cleaning</a> are required to
    maintain the implant, as there is a risk of developing ‘peri-implantitis’.
    Once the implant process is complete, implants are like normal
    teeth in that you can eat on them, floss round them and are
    often very well disguised within the rest of the dentition.</p>
<p>It helps to have realistic expectations with implants however.
    Sometimes, the soft tissues (gum lines) around the implant
    do not follow the same contours as natural teeth, meaning
    there are some gaps. If there has been bone resorption/loss
    of bone, the implant tooth may need to be longer than the
    tooth next to it to disguise this, which can look unusual
    if you show a lot of gum when you smile. There also needs
    to be enough bone to place an implant, and enough space.
    This can mean you need a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/getting-started">bone graft</a>    (for example from the chin) before the implant can be placed.
    An alternative may be synthetic bone from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>Not everyone is suitable to have implants due to medical reasons.
    This can include use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonate medications</a>,
    previous head and neck <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>,
    smoking, uncontrolled <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">gum disease</a>    or severe bleeding disorders. It is important to be completely
    open when discussing these things with your surgeon to ensure
    any treatment provided for you is safe.  </p>
<p>If you need multiple teeth replacing, there are different options
    available. Implants can support dentures by giving them added
    retention. They can be used to hold dentures in place, with
    small attachments built into the denture that can allow it
    to be ‘clipped’ onto the implants. The denture may also be
    fastened to implants, which can be removed by your dentist
    for regular professional cleaning, as well as you cleaning
    the denture yourself at home.</p>
<p>The number of implants required can vary from a single tooth
    to many for full-mouth rehabilitation. Patients may have
    two to eight, or more implants placed to hold their new artificial
    teeth in place. Again, this is a personal decision based
    on lots of factors, so your surgeon will discuss the options
    with you.</p>
