<p>We keep the following subdivision of bone lesions and their treatments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>inflammatory (including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bone infections</a>)
        and other non-neoplastic bone lesions;</li>
    <li>benign neoplastic bone lesions (benign bone tumours);</li>
    <li>malignant neoplastic bone lesions (bone cancers)</li>
</ul>
<p>and look next into treatment options for individual conditions
    within each of the three categories of bone lesions.</p>
<h1 id="infections-inflammatory-and-other-non-neoplastic-bone-lesions">Infections, inflammatory and other non-neoplastic bone lesions</h1>
<h2>Dry socket (alveolar osteitis)</h2>
<p>The treatment of localised dry socket (alveolar osteitis) consists
    mainly of local treatments. If the application of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">local anaesthetics</a>    can be tolerated, then cleaning out of the socket and dressing
    it with a resorbable commercial antiseptic or analgesic pack
    will often be all that is needed. If these packs do not work,
    then an alternative pack made up of cotton wool, a small
    amount of zinc oxide (an effective topical <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">anti-inflammatory agent</a>)
    and eugenol (the main component of clove oil) will provide
    pain relief. This pack will have to be removed and sometimes
    has to be replaced, but it is almost unique in providing
    complete pain relief from intractable dry socket pain.  </p>
<p>If the application of local anaesthetics cannot be tolerated,
    then provision of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">systemic antibacterial medication</a>    such as metronidazole (effective in treating infections by
    a range of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">anaerobic bacteria</a>)
    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">systemic analgesics</a>    (mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (NSAIDs), such
    as ibuprofen, with or without codeine/paracetamol) is just
    about all that can be achieved.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that some people seem to be much more prone
    to this condition than others.</p>
<h2>Osteomyelitis</h2>
<p>The term osteomyelitis covers a fair range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/detailed">inflammatory bone conditions</a>,
    typically evolving from some initial <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">bacterial infection</a>    of dental origin but may also lack any frank (or obscure)
    infectious origin. Osteomyelitis may be suppurative or non-suppurative
    (producing pus, or not). In addition, there are different
    forms of acute and chronic osteomyelitis. The corresponding
    treatment options reflect this diversity.</p>
<p>The general management of <strong>acute osteomyelitis</strong>    includes the correction of any underlying systemic factors
    and potential causes; this is vital. Routine investigations
    should include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>full blood count</li>
    <li>routine biochemistry tests, including blood glucose</li>
    <li>C-reactive protein (CRP) +/- ESR</li>
    <li>blood cultures.</li>
</ul>
<aside>
    <p>If you would like to read more about these tests, there is
        much more information on our detailed pages about general
        <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>        and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">biochemical investigations</a>        aiming to identify potential sources of infection(s).</p>
</aside>
<p>If somebody is systemically unwell, then <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">intravenous application</a>    of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial agents</a>    should be started. Penicillin and flucloxacillin are a good
    best guess; clindamycin is used when somebody is allergic
    to, or intolerant of, penicillin and penicillin derivatives.
    If necessary, the antibacterial agent(s) can be changed when
    bacterial culture results are available and suggest a different
    agent.</p>
<p>Surgical treatment includes the drainage of pus and the removal
    of any focus of infection (such as tooth, foreign body).
    In established cases, saucerization (excavation of tissue)
    and decortication (removal of surface layer of bone (the
    hard, cortical bone layer)) may be necessary to allow coverage
    of the medullary space (the inner channel of bone) by well
    vascularised (supplied with blood vessels) soft tissue. Measurement
    of the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">CRP count</a>    helps to monitor the response to treatment.</p>
<p>Resection of any bone sequestrum (piece of dead bone) or clinically
    ischaemic (lacking blood supply) bone is particularly important
    in the type of osteomyelitis caused by <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiation</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">medicinal drugs</a>.
    This may be helped by packing of the resulting defect with
    a collagen ‘fleece’ impregnated with gentamycin (an antibacterial
    agent). The remaining bone must be covered with sealed healthy
    vascularised tissue whenever possible.</p>
<p>In <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">pathological fractures</a>    associated with osteomyelitis, rigid fixation is shown to
    improve healing. In those cases involving bone damage by
    radiation or medicinal drugs, fresh vascularised bone and
    soft tissue to create watertight seals around healing bone
    are generally advocated.</p>
<h2><strong>Chronic osteomyelitis</strong></h2>
<p>Treatments are the same as for acute osteomyelitis (see above).
    All correctable host factors for infection should be addressed.
    <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a>,
    HBO may be of value in refractory cases, particularly those
    associated with previous <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>.
    However, there is no conclusive evidence about the efficacy
    of HBO for this condition.</p>
<h2><strong>Garré’s’ sclerosing osteomyelitis</strong></h2>
<p>Any source of infection should be removed, sometimes this has
    to be surprisingly radical. Antibacterial agents are not
    helpful. Remodelling of the bone is the rule, but surgical
    re-contouring may be needed.</p>
<h2><strong>Chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis</strong></h2>
<p>Treatment can be problematic. Long-term antibacterial therapy
    has been reported as being of benefit if given early in the
    course of the disease, but there are also reports that high-dose
    long-term antibacterial therapy has no beneficial effects.
    In more refractory cases, a course of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">corticosteroids</a>    and decortication may be of benefit. <a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a>    can be used to supplement the surgery although the evidence
    base is conflicting. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">Bisphosphonates</a>    have been advocated for chronic pain but have obvious conflicting
    risks regarding development of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteonecrosis</a>.
    In some cases, more radical surgical intervention is required,
    such as resection of the affected region of the mandible
    (Figure 1 and Figure 2; note that the surgical techniques
    are essentially the same for some benign and malignant (see
    below) conditions).</p>

</figure>
<p>The real problems are the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">management of pain</a>,
    which may be due to some form of autonomic dysfunction (a
    degree of malfunction of involuntary nerve actions).</p>
<h2>Cysts</h2>
<aside>
    <p>Given that cysts are such a common condition affecting the
        head and neck area, in particular the jaws, we have separate
        sections describing the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">many different varieties of cysts</a>,
        the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/detailed">origins and features of cysts</a>        as well as the <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">surgical treatment (removal) of cysts</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h2>Fibrous dysplasia and ossifying fibroma</h2>
<p>Treatment should wait until completion of growth because this
    is a hamartomatous problem (a benign malformation that evolves
    at the same rate as normal body growth in infants). Resculpting
    of the malformation is best achieved after growth is completed.</p>
<p>Ossifying fibroma is thought to be a localised, benign tumour,
    variant of fibrous dysplasia. The lesion can usually be safely
    enucleated (removed) within its fibrous envelope (see Figure
    3 for an example). Significant bone resection is not necessary.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-bone-lesion-level2-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Specimen of an ossifying fibroma
        showing how it can be ‘shelled out’ from the surrounding
        bone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Osteopetrosis</h2>
<p>There is no cure for this rare inherited condition. The milder
    form of the condition in adults is often without symptoms
    but may require surgical intervention if over time facial
    disfigurement or dysfunction develops. The severe form of
    the condition in infants typically is fatal within approximately
    10 years.</p>
<h2>Paget’s disease of bone</h2>
<p>Treatment is complex and in the absence of symptoms there may
    be no need for treatment. If, however, there is need to treat
    the condition, the management is by medication. The medications
    most commonly used are <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosponates</a>    (otherwise a common type of medication to treat osteoporosis).
    The risk of bisphosphonate-related <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard">osteonecrosis of the jaw</a>    associated with this treatment of Paget’s disease of bone
    is of obvious relevance. An alternative medication may be
    calcitonin. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/calcitonin">Calcitonin</a>    is a hormone that is involved in the regulation of the calcium
    metabolism as well as the general regeneration metabolism
    of bones.</p>
<p>Very rarely, surgical intervention may be required to correct
    bone deformation(s), for example to reduce <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">pressure on nerves</a>.</p>
<h1 id="benign-neoplastic-bone-lesions-benign-bone-tumours">Benign neoplastic bone lesions (benign bone tumours)</h1>
<h2>Ameloblastoma (unicystic, follicular/plexiform, and peripheral)</h2>
<p>Ameloblastoma has a range of pathological behaviours, based on
    local destructiveness and propensity for recurrence. These
    tumours do not metastasise but do need wide local excision
    and sometimes <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery</a>.</p>
<p>Treatment of <strong>unicystic ameloblastoma</strong> consists
    of ‘radical’ enucleation, in which a margin of the surrounding
    bone is resected or otherwise treated (<a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">cryosurgery</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/carnoy">Carnoy’s solution</a>    (‘chemical curettage’). This is similar to the treatment
    of recurrent <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst/more-info">keratocystic odontogenic tumours</a>.</p>
<p>For the treatment of <strong>follicular/plexiform ameloblastoma</strong>,
    conventional bone resection is performed with a small margin
    (0.5 cm), preserving vital structures when possible. Segmental
    resection may be necessary, and bone and nerve grafting may
    be necessary to repair the mandibular discontinuity after
    segmental mandibular resection (see Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-bone-lesion-level2-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Bone and nerve grafting supported
        by a reconstruction plate to repair the mandibular discontinuity
        after segmental mandibular resection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The (rare) extraosseous soft-tissue version of ameloblastoma,
    <strong>peripheral ameloblastoma</strong>, is treated by
    subperiosteal (beneath the dense connective tissue enveloping
    bone) soft tissue excision with a 0.5 cm margin of normal
    tissue.</p>
<p><strong>Other odontogenic benign tumours</strong> (such as adenoameloblastoma,
    myxoma, or ameloblastic fibroma) are all extremely rare.
    They are all managed by conservative excision.</p>
<h2>Bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation (Nora’s lesion)</h2>
<p>Resection with a very limited margin is usually used but there
    is no real certainty about the best form of treatment.</p>
<h2>Giant cell granuloma of bone</h2>
<p>Treatment of this intrabony swelling is the same as for its soft-tissue
    counterpart, by excision. In the United States there are
    some clinicians who manage these lesions by intralesional
    application of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">corticosteroids</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/calcitonin">calcitonin</a>    or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/interferon">interferon</a>;
    these medical management approaches are not in use in the
    UK or Europe.</p>
<h2>Osteoma / Gardner’s syndrome</h2>
<p>Treatment of this benign tumour of bone consists of local excision,
    Figure 5 depicts an example of resection of a mandibular
    osteoma.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-bone-lesion-level2-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Resection of a mandibular osteoma,
        showing the subperiosteal plane common to most jaw surgery.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Torus</h2>
<p>These entirely benign bony exostoses (outgrowth of cartilaginous
    tissue on a bone) require removal only if somebody is very
    concerned about them, or in preparation for prosthesis. Significant
    exostoses may require excision both for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">diagnostic</a>    purposes and/or for reasons of symptom relief.</p>
<h1 id="malignant-neoplastic-bone-lesions-bone-cancers">Malignant neoplastic bone lesions (bone cancers)</h1>
<p>Treatment for all of the rare primary bone malignancies (including
    osteosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma in cystic cavities, Ewing
    sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, ameloblastic carcinoma) in the head
    and neck region is essentially the same. The first line treatment
    is radical resection. In most cases there will be substantial
    defects that will require <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    in order to restore functionality. Where the mandible is
    involved, in some cases it is possible to preserve continuity
    of the mandible (a so-called rim resection; see Figure 1
    above), otherwise a segmental resection (see Figure 4 above)
    causes discontinuity of the mandible. The former is desirable
    in terms of superior functional results but must only be
    used if the required degree of radical resection is not compromised.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">Neck dissection</a>    is standard practice in node positive patients (with malignant
    deposits in the lymph nodes), or when access to neck vessels
    (even if nodes are negative on imaging) is required for
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>. Postoperative <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        is used if margins are close (less than 5 mm, or multiple
        positive lymph nodes found on <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">histopathological examination</a>        after neck dissection, or extracapsular spread is found
        in common with other head and neck malignancy).</p>
