<p>There are hundreds of blood components that can provide information
    about all kinds of metabolism, bodily functions and malfunctions.
    Only a small number of blood tests are routinely carried
    out. The following is a selection of some of the more commonly
    used blood tests. The selection is subdivided into:</p>
<p>·      general screening tests (general screening)</p>
<p>·      tests that address immune-system related questions (immunology)</p>
<p>·      hormones and other substances produced by various glands
    (endocrinology)</p>
<p>·      some other tests (miscellaneous).</p>
<p>We do not quote quantities or ‘typical’ results for any of the
    tests, for three reasons: i) some test results are reported
    as relative rather than absolute quantities and depend on
    individual laboratory procedures and calibration routines;
    ii) depending on individual circumstances a deviation from
    the standard range of quantities may not be indicative of
    any disorders; iii) for a particular condition only a combined
    set of results from different tests may give meaningful information.</p>
<p>Looking for so called <a href="/diagnosis/tests/further-reading">tumour markers</a>    is commonly included in the diagnosis and monitoring of a
    number of malignancies by blood tests. However, tumour marker
    tests are irrelevant for head and neck malignancies and thus
    are not included in the following selection of blood tests.</p>
<h1 id="general-screening-tests">General screening tests</h1>
<h2>FBC, full blood count</h2>
<p>A so called full blood count is a common general screening test.
    It analyses the composition of blood in terms of concentration
    of red blood cells (oxygen transport around the body), haemoglobin
    (the specific molecule binding oxygen molecules for transport),
    white blood cells (part of the body’s immune system and necessary
    for fighting infections) and platelets (part of the blood
    clotting system).</p>
<p>Abnormally low concentrations of haemoglobin can indicate anaemia
    or some form of chronic bleeding; abnormally high concentrations
    of haemoglobin can give a hint at bone marrow problems.</p>
<p>Abnormally low concentrations of white blood cells may be related
    to bone marrow problems or viral infections; high concentrations
    of white blood cells are a sign of an ongoing infection or
    may occasionally be related to a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour">haematological malignancy (blood cancer)</a>.</p>
<p>Low concentrations of platelets may be caused by viral infections
    or some autoimmune diseases, by medications (including a
    number of <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy drugs</a>),
    by vitamin K deficiency or some <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">blood malignancies</a>    such as leukaemia. High platelet concentrations are most
    commonly a sign of inflammation or infections, occasionally
    indicative of a bone marrow disorder.</p>
<h2>Electrolytes</h2>
<p>Testing the levels of electrolytes is a common part of a general
    assessment. An electrolyte test measures the levels of Na<sup>+</sup>,
    K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>    (bicarbonate) and indirectly determines the pH balance (acidity
    level) as well. These electrolytes are necessary to regulate
    the body fluid retention (water), the body’s response to
    electrical signals (heart beat), transport mechanisms in
    and out of cells across cell membranes, and stabilisation
    of pH.</p>
<p>An electrolyte test is not specific to a particular condition,
    many disorders can cause electrolyte imbalances, for example
    dehydration, kidney disorders or heart conditions, or abnormal
    levels of some hormones. An electrolyte test is an informative
    first step in the investigation of fluid retention (oedema)
    or irregular heart beat (dysrhythmia).</p>
<h2>Glucose test</h2>
<p>This is a simple  screening test where the blood glucose level
    is measured once, either after several hours fasting or randomly.
    Higher than normal glucose levels for either circumstance
    will need to be followed up by a more detailed glucose tolerance
    test (see below under endocrinology). The diagnostic usefulness
    of a single glucose test is questionable unless it is done
    as part of the structured and regular self-monitoring routines
    of people with diabetes.</p>
<h2>ANA, autoantibody screen</h2>
<p>This test is an initial search for the presence of a particular
    antibody, antinuclear antibody (ANA). This antibody is often
    present in a range of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
    arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, lupus erythematosus, or some
    forms of hepatitis. If this antibody is found, in a next
    step screening for more disease-specific antibodies usually
    follows in order to arrive at a diagnosis.</p>
<h2><strong>PT / INR test</strong></h2>
<p>A prothrombin time (PT) test measures the time it takes for blood
    to clot. In order to make data from this test comparable
    between laboratories and for different test methods, the
    data are usually reported as relative quantities, known as
    the international normalised ratio (INR).</p>
<p>The PT / INR test is used to monitor the working of long-term
    treatment with so-called blood thinners (warfarin) and to
    check for bleeding risks in planned surgery. Abnormally long
    coagulation times can be indicative of liver disorders (some
    of the coagulation factors are produced in the liver), or
    lack of vitamin K (necessary for the synthesis of prothrombin
    and other clotting factors). Low levels of coagulation factors,
    causing hard-to-control bleeding and bruising, are also found
    in hereditary conditions (haemophilia).</p>
<p>A PT / INR test is often followed up by further coagulation tests
    and/or liver function tests (see below).</p>
<h2>Coagulation tests / clotting studies</h2>
<p>The coagulation (clotting) properties of blood need to be finely
    balanced: coagulation must be easy enough to occur so that
    bleeding after injury stops promptly; at the same time coagulation
    must not occur in normal blood circulation because blood
    clots would kill the body very quickly.</p>
<p>Conditions causing clotting abnormalities include liver disease
    (many proteins involved in coagulation are produced in the
    liver), haemophilia (lack of coagulation) or thrombophilia
    (excessive coagulation).</p>
<p>A set of different tests aims to characterise the causes of coagulation
    disorders by measuring the levels of several proteins and
    other components in blood and/or the time it takes for blood
    to clot. Coagulation tests are also necessary to monitor
    the working of long-term treatment with anticoagulants (warfarin
    or heparin) and may be required before surgery to minimise
    bleeding risks (modern synthetic anticoagulants do not need
    monitoring but their action cannot be reversed).</p>
<p>Sets of coagulation tests may include:</p>
<p><i>FBC</i>; full blood count (see above).</p>
<p><i>PT / INR</i>; prothrombin test (see above).</p>
<p><i>Platelet count</i>; is usually included in a FBC (see above).</p>
<p><i>Thrombin time</i>, <i>TT</i>; this test is an indirect assessment
    of the function of the protein fibrinogen. Long thrombin
    times can be due to either low levels of fibrinogen or abnormal
    fibrinogen function, or both. Long thrombin times are also
    found in conjunction with malnutrition and advanced liver
    disease.</p>
<p><i>Fibrinogen level</i>; this test determines the level of fibrinogen
    in blood plasma. Enhanced levels occur with acute inflammation
    (for example, in the early stages of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>)
    whereas low levels can indicate liver disease, or a condition
    where fibrinogen is consumed faster than it is synthesized
    (disseminated intravascular coagulation, DIC).</p>
<p><i>Factor V level</i>; factor V is a protein, predominantly synthesized
    in the liver; in its activated form it functions as a co-factor
    in the enzymatic reaction that converts prothrombin to thrombin.
    Low levels of factor V cause prolonged PT times and may indicate
    liver disease or DIC; normal levels of factor V may be hampered
    by interaction with some antibodies.</p>
<h2>Cholesterol and triglycerides</h2>
<p>Determining the levels of cholesterol (and triglycerides) in
    the blood is a common test to assess the lipid metabolism
    of the body.</p>
<p>Triglycerides are the fat-storage lipid of the body, they are
    produced in the liver and are predominantly the end product
    of digesting fat in food. High blood levels of triglycerides
    have been related to increased risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is a transport form of lipid in blood for delivery
    to all body tissues; cholesterol is a necessary component
    in the cell metabolism. The transport form of cholesterol
    is called a lipoprotein, with cholesterol bonded to a protein.
    There are two types of lipoproteins in circulation: LDL (low-density
    lipoprotein, ‘bad cholesterol’) and HDL (high-density protein,
    ‘good cholesterol’). High levels of LDL are thought to be
    responsible for lipid deposits in arteries, reducing the
    efficacy of blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attacks
    and stroke. HDL is the form in which excess cholesterol is
    transported back to the liver for processing.</p>
<p>High levels of triglycerides and/or cholesterols may be related
    to poor diet and/or lack of exercise, or may be caused by
    genetic conditions. An accurate cholesterol and triglyceride
    test requires at least 12 hours fasting before the test.</p>
<h2>Folate / folic acid</h2>
<p>Folic acid belongs to the class of B vitamins. Folic acid is
    essential for the maintenance and renewal of blood components
    (red and white blood cells, platelets) and for the normal
    development of a foetus.</p>
<p>Folic acid levels measured in blood plasma depend on recent dietary
    intake whereas the folic acid levels in red blood cell reflect
    an average stored amount over a period of time.</p>
<p>Folic acid levels are often measured together with levels of
    vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, as low levels of either of these
    two B vitamins can cause anaemia. Anaemia may also be caused
    by malabsorption of folic acid or vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.</p>
<h1 id="immunology">Immunology</h1>
<h2>ASDA test</h2>
<p>This test looks for the presence of specific salivary gland duct
    antibodies in blood. These are a marker for Sjögren’s syndrome,
    an autoimmune disorder leading to inflammation of some glands
    and, in consequence, especially to dry mouth and eyes from
    lack of tear and saliva production.</p>
<p>The test returns a positive finding only for about two thirds
    of cases of Sjögren’s syndrome and further tests may be necessary
    to diagnose or exclude this rare condition.</p>
<h2>C1-INH test</h2>
<p>C1 is one of nine very large protein molecules (C1 to C9) that
    circulate in the blood stream and are part of the body’s
    immune system. Testing the levels of C1 in blood is one (of
    many) test to help identify specific causes of inflammation
    and swelling (oedema). Abnormal concentrations of C1 are
    in particular indicative of a condition called angioedema
    and of a number of autoimmune disorders (for example, lupus
    erythematosus). Low levels of C1 are associated with kidney
    diseases (nephritis), septicaemia and recurring bacterial
    infections.</p>
<h2>Allergy tests, IgE</h2>
<p>Testing for allergies is most commonly done by skin tests. However,
    if severe eczema or other serious skin conditions prevent
    skin testing, or if a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic
    shock) is expected from exposure to allergens during testing,
    then using blood samples to look for allergy markers is an
    alternative. A high concentration of a particular type of
    antibody, immunoglobulin E (IgE) tends to indicate allergic
    reactions. When high levels of IgE are found, further screening
    for several of the most common allergens (such as dust, moulds,
    specific foods) is usually carried out by searching for allergen-specific
    antibodies. This screening approach is called enzyme-linked
    immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>
<p>Measuring blood levels of IgE may also be included in a wider
    screening of different types of antibodies, in immunoglobulin
    tests (see below).</p>
<h2>Immunoglobulin tests</h2>
<p>Immunoglobulins, Igs, are antibodies found in all areas of the
    body. Antibodies are the frontline of the body’s immune system,
    defending the body against infections and other foreign substances.
    Antibodies also represent a body’s memory with regard to
    successfully overcome infections in the past, by keeping
    copies of antibodies acquired in the process and which can
    be re-activated should the need arise (this being similar
    to the underlying mechanisms of immunisation by vaccines).
    The roles of antibodies are varied, accordingly there are
    several different categories of antibodies.</p>
<p><i>IgG</i>. The most common antibodies (ca. 75 percent), found
    in all body fluids. IgG antibodies are crucial in combatting
    bacterial and viral infections.</p>
<p>High levels of IgG are related to chronic infections (such as
    HIV or hepatitis), multiple sclerosis and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">multiple myeloma</a>    where only one type of defective IgG antibody is produced.
    Low levels of IgG are observed with some types of leukaemia,
    kidney damage and recurrent infections. Macroglobulinaemia
    (abnormally high levels of IgM) suppresses the synthesis
    of IgG.</p>
<p><i>IgA</i>. The second most common type of antibodies (ca. 10-15
    percent) they mostly protect inner and outer body surfaces
    (nose, eyes, vagina, digestive tract) and are found in saliva,
    tears and blood.</p>
<p>High levels of IgA are related to chronic liver diseases, a range
    of autoimmune disorders and some type(s) of multiple myeloma.
    Low levels of IgA are observed with some types of leukaemia
    and with kidney damage (nephrotic syndrome).</p>
<p><i>IgM.</i> The third most common type of antibodies (ca. 5-10
    percent) and very large molecules. They are found in blood
    and lymph fluid and are the first-line defence response to
    infection, as well as regulating the responses of other antibodies.</p>
<p>High levels of IgM are observed in acute new infections, especially
    viral infections (hepatitis, mononucleosis), in rheumatoid
    arthritis and macroglobulinaemia. Low levels of IgM are related
    to some forms of multiple myeloma and some forms of leukaemia,
    as well as some autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p><i>IgE</i>. IgE antibodies specialise in triggering body reactions
    to foreign substances such as pollen or mould spores. Often
    high IgE levels are found in connection with allergic reactions
    (see above; allergy test IgE) and asthma.</p>
<p><i>IgD</i>. IgD antibodies are found in relatively small amounts
    in the lining of the chest. It has been speculated that they
    share some of the role of IgM or, more recently, it has been
    suggested that IgD antibodies have specific roles in respiratory
    immune defence of the respiratory mucosa.</p>
<p>Typically, Ig tests include screening the levels of IgG, IgA
    and IgM. Combined consideration of the results for all three
    types of antibodies is useful to identify certain autoimmune
    diseases, some haematological malignancies, reasons for recurring
    infections and bone marrow disorders.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">Specific antibody tests</a>    are needed to check the response to immunisations and to
    identify the presence of specific infections, past or present.</p>
<h1 id="endocrinology">Endocrinology</h1>
<h2>Glucose tolerance test</h2>
<p>This procedure monitors how efficiently the body processes glucose.
    Glucose is the sugar that the body uses as an energy-provision
    molecule. Persistent high blood levels of glucose (hyperglycaemia)
    are indicative of diabetes and a few other conditions. Low
    blood levels of glucose (hypoglycaemia) most commonly afflict
    people with diabetes on insulin when, for example, they get
    their timing and quantity of insulin injections and eating
    and/or quantities of food wrong. Otherwise hypoglycaemia
    may be related to insufficient function of the adrenal gland
    or pancreas, or to various liver or kidney disorders (substantial
    hypoglycaemia is a dangerous condition and needs immediate
    intervention).</p>
<p>A blood sample is taken first and the amount of glucose in the
    sample is determined. Next a measured quantity of glucose
    is given, either orally (as a very sweet drink) or directly
    as an injection into a vein. Then a few more blood samples
    are taken at intervals and the glucose blood levels are monitored
    as a function of time. Slower than normal removal of glucose
    from the blood stream can indicate diabetes.</p>
<p>The actual amounts of glucose that normally circulate in the
    body are small and only fluctuate little in a healthy person.
    The most accurate methods to measure these small glucose
    concentrations are by reacting a small amount of blood with
    a calibrated amount of a glucose-specific enzyme (glucose
    oxidase or hexokinase). These are usually prepared on a test
    strip.</p>
<h2>HbA1c test</h2>
<p>Haemoglobin (Hb) molecules are the proteins in the red blood
    cells responsible to transport oxygen around the body. If
    glucose is present in the blood, glucose molecules will firmly
    bind to the Hb protein molecules, forming a stable complex.
    This form of ‘glycated’ Hb protein molecules is called HbA1c.
    The amount of HbA1c complex is directly proportional to the
    glucose level in blood.</p>
<p>Measuring HbA1c levels in blood is an important component in
    diabetes monitoring. A glucose tolerance test (see above)
    gives a measure of the on-the-day performance of the body
    with regard to glucose processing / insulin availability,
    something like a snapshot. The HbA1c test provides insight
    into average blood glucose levels over a longer period of
    time, over ca. 2-3 months. The test provides information
    about average glucose levels over that period of time because
    the Hb and HbA1c carrying red blood cells survive for about
    2-3 months in the body. This long-term monitoring is an important
    tool in trying to avoid or minimise long-term harm caused
    by poorly controlled glucose levels in diabetes.</p>
<h2>Short synacthen test</h2>
<p>This test measures the levels of the hormone cortisol in blood,
    after stimulation of its production. Cortisol (and the proper
    regulation of its production) is important for the functioning
    of, amongst others, the immune system and the regulation
    of blood pressure and insulin levels in the blood.</p>
<p>The production of cortisol (‘on demand’ production) is regulated
    by a number of interconnected feedback loops involving the
    hypothalamus (monitoring body functions), the pituitary gland
    (initiating cortisol production by releasing a hormone, ACTH)
    and the adrenal glands (next to the kidneys) where the actual
    cortisol production is triggered by ACTH.</p>
<p>The short synacthen test involves the injection of a chemical,
    tetracosactide, (synacthen) that activates cortisol production
    in the adrenal glands, just as ACTH does naturally. If after
    this stimulation cortisol levels in the blood remain low,
    this can indicate a failure of the adrenal glands (for example
    caused by a rare autoimmune disease, Addison’s disease).
    If the cortisol levels in the blood increase after the stimulation,
    this may indicate damage to, or malfunction of the pituitary
    gland (for example caused by a tumour or damage caused by
    radiotherapy applied to the head and neck region).</p>
<h2>Amylase</h2>
<p>Amylase is an enzyme that is found in <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">saliva</a>,
    it is synthesized in the salivary glands and the pancreas.
    The physiological role of amylase is to help with the break-down
    and digestion of starch. High concentrations of amylase in
    blood (or urine) indicate acute inflammation of the pancreas
    (pancreatitis) or severe gastroenteritis.</p>
<h2>TSH test</h2>
<p>A thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH, test is carried out as a
    part of checking the thyroid gland and its role in a complicated
    chain of events of hormone releases. A small structure in
    the brain, the hypothalamus, releases a hormone TRH (thyrotropin-releasing
    hormone). TRH activates the pituitary gland (hypophysis,
    another small structure in the brain, close to the hypothalamus)
    to produce TSH, and finally this release of TSH activates
    the thyroid gland to produce and release two hormones (triiodethyronine
    and thyroxine), both being an integral part of the body’s
    metabolism control mechanism.</p>
<p>A TSH test helps to find out if over- or underactivity of the
    thyroid gland is due to a damaged gland or due to problems
    elsewhere in the chain of hormone-release events. TSH testing
    is also used to monitor medication for hypothyroidism (underactive
    thyroid gland) or for replacement medication after removal
    of the thyroid gland.</p>
<p>High blood levels of TSH indicate an underactive thyroid gland
    (with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis being the most common cause),
    very rarely a pituitary gland tumour (producing TSH), or
    simply identify poorly adjusted medication for treating hypothyroidism.
    Low blood levels of TSH are related to an overactive thyroid
    gland, occasionally to damage of the pituitary gland, or
    simply to poorly adjusted medication for treating hypothyroidism.</p>
<h2>PTH test</h2>
<p>Measuring the parathyroid hormone, PTH, levels in blood is an
    investigation into the function of the four parathyroid glands
    (tiny glands in the neck, close to the thyroid gland). PTH
    is essential in the regulation of bone growth and maintenance.
    PTH controls vitamin D, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>    levels in blood. Accordingly, a PTH test provides information
    about severe forms of osteoporosis, about the reasons behind
    high Ca<sup>2+</sup> and low PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>    blood levels, and about certain kidney disorders.</p>
<p>High levels of PTH are found for several disorders of the parathyroid
    glands, lack of vitamin D, some kidney disorders, the body
    being immune (unreactive) to PTH, and poor diet (lack of
    Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Low levels of PTH are found after removal
    or damage of the parathyroid glands in neck surgery, or damage
    of the parathyroid glands by some autoimmune disorders or
    by radiotherapy to the head and neck region. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">Bone metastases</a>    from malignancies elsewhere in the body, low Mg<sup>2+</sup>    blood levels, excess vitamin D and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> intake
    (supplements) also lead to low PTH blood levels.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h1>
<h2>ESR test (inflammation indicator)</h2>
<p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a measure of the
    severity of the body’s response to inflammation and can be
    used to monitor inflammatory conditions; it does not identify
    the cause of inflammation.</p>
<p>Inflammation alters the surface structure of red blood cells
    (erythrocytes), causing them to build aggregates of red blood
    cells. This tendency to form aggregates is greater the more
    severe the body’s reaction to inflammation is.  Aggregates
    of red blood cells settle more quickly to the bottom of a
    tube than individual red blood cells. Accordingly, this sedimentation
    rate is an indirect measure of the severity of the body’s
    immune system response.</p>
<h2>CRP test (inflammation indicator)</h2>
<p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced in the liver as part of
    the response of the body to inflammation, it is not specific
    to a particular cause of inflammation. The role of this protein
    is to enable macrophages to dispose of dead or dying cells
    (including some bacterial cells). A high level of CRP in
    blood plasma is an acute-phase indicator of inflammation,
    similar to ESR (see above).</p>
<h2>TPMT test (drug safety)</h2>
<p>Thiopurine methyltransferase, TPMT is an enzyme needed for metabolising
    thiopurine compounds. Absence or low activity of this enzyme
    is a fairly common genetic deficiency (affecting ca. 1 in
    300). Testing for TPMT activity is necessary to find out
    if treatment with azathioprine (and similar drugs) is safe
    or carries a risk of severe side effects (such as bone marrow
    suppression) if not properly metabolised due to lack of enzymatic
    activity. Azathioprine (and similar drugs) belongs to the
    class of so called <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles">antimetabolites</a>.
    It is used as an immunosuppressant in the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">treatment of a range of autoimmune diseases</a>    (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease or lupus erythematosus).</p>
<p>Absence or low activity of TPMT also acts as an indirect biomarker
    for predicting the toxicity of and/or intolerance to chemotherapy
    treatment with cisplatin [treatment-chemotherapy-chem-principle-level1].</p>
<h2>Zinc (trace element)</h2>
<p>Zinc, that is Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, is an essential trace element
    for a variety of body functions; it is a co-factor in many
    enzymatic reactions. The Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration is
    usually measured in blood serum or plasma.</p>
<p>A lower than normal Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration in blood can
    occur as a consequence of <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">excessive alcohol consumption</a>,
    of serious burns or of a poor diet. Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency
    causes problems with wound healing, can cause a range of
    skin conditions and hampers the immune system.</p>
<h2>Magnesium (electrolyte)</h2>
<p>Magnesium, that is Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, are a part of the overall
    electrolyte orchestrated ‘traffic’ into and out of cells.
    Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are necessary for muscle and nerve function
    as well as for the activity of some enzymes. Only very small
    amounts are in circulation, most of it is found in bone and
    inside cells. Mg<sup>2+</sup> blood levels are closely related
    to the blood levels of other electrolytes (Ca<sup>2+</sup>,
    K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>).
    One purpose of testing Mg<sup>2+</sup> blood levels is actually
    to find out about underlying reasons for abnormal blood levels
    of other electrolytes, in particular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p>
<p>High Mg<sup>2+</sup> blood levels can indicate kidney failure,
    dehydration, malfunction of the adrenal glands (Addison’s
    disease), an underactive thyroid gland, or simply occur as
    a consequence of (over)use of Mg<sup>2+</sup> containing
    over-the-counter drugs (antacids and laxatives).  Low Mg<sup>2+</sup>    levels are rare and mainly are related to diabetes complications,
    kidney disorders, or pancreatitis. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels
    are also found in conjunction with <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">excessive alcohol consumption</a>,
    or alcohol withdrawal, as well as a poor diet.</p>
<h2>Trace metal ions</h2>
<p>Trace metal ions are present in very small but measurable quantities
    in cells. They include ions of iron, zinc, magnesium, lithium,
    nickel, cobalt, vanadium, copper, chromium, manganese, selenium
    (not a trace metal but a trace element). Many ions of these
    elements would be toxic in higher concentrations but are
    essential components in very low concentrations as components
    in numerous enzymes and vitamins, usually involved in specific
    biochemical reactions. Sources of trace metal ions are usually
    dietary.</p>
<p>Insufficient levels of trace metal ions can cause a wide variety
    of deficiency effects, such as low iron levels and anaemia.
    Excessive intake of trace elements, for example by overuse
    of dietary supplements, can cause toxicity effects.</p>
<h2>Urea (kidney function)</h2>
<p>Urea is a metabolic waste product that is synthesized in the
    liver, from there it is carried by the blood stream to the
    kidneys. Healthy kidneys will filter out this waste product
    from the blood and urea consequently is excreted <i>via</i>    urine. High urea levels in blood indicate poor kidney function
    for a number of possible reasons, or may be related to a
    number of other conditions, ranging from severe burns to
    heart failure. Low urea levels in blood are rarely found,
    except in pregnancy or as a consequence of a poor diet of
    vegetarians when their diet is too low in proteins.</p>
<p>A urea blood test can be indicated for diagnosing any of the
    conditions mentioned above, it is commonly used to monitor
    dialysis patients and the treatment of kidney disorders in
    general. In addition, it is used to assess kidney function
    before starting treatment with drugs that may be nephrotoxic
    (harmful to the kidneys), such as chemotherapy treatment
    with <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles">cisplatin</a>.</p>
<h2>Creatinine (kidney function)</h2>
<p>Similar to the urea test (see above), a creatinine test measures
    the ability of the kidneys to remove creatinine from the
    blood by determining the creatinine levels in blood serum.
    Creatinine is another waste product, originating from muscle
    metabolism, and will be efficiently filtered out by healthy
    kidneys. The purposes of creatinine tests are similar to
    those of urea testing but include the monitoring of some
    muscle disorders, diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>It is common to combine urea and creatinine tests, and there
    may be reasons to measure in addition the amounts of urea
    and/or creatinine in <a href="/diagnosis/tests/urine-tests">urine</a>.</p>
<h2>BIL (liver function)</h2>
<p>Bilirubin (BIL) is the waste product from breaking down old red
    blood cells. BIL is a yellow pigment, high levels of bilirubin
    lead to jaundice (yellow skin and white of eyes). Bilirubin
    is transported to the liver and then stored in the gallbladder,
    then in the form of bile helps to digest fat in the small
    intestine, before being excreted with the faeces.</p>
<p>High bilirubin blood levels can be caused by liver conditions
    (such as hepatitis or cirrhosis) when the liver fails to
    process normal quantities of bilirubin, gallbladder conditions
    or blockages of the bile ducts. Alternatively, if a larger
    than normal quantity of red blood cells are broken down (haemolysis)
    the (healthy) liver may not be able to keep up with bilirubin
    processing. This may be caused by some autoimmune conditions,
    infections or drug toxicity.</p>
<p>A bilirubin test is usually a part of a more general set of liver
    function tests (LFT, see below) and is also commonly used
    to assess the safety of drug treatments with high potential
    for liver toxicity.</p>
<h2>LFT, liver function test</h2>
<p>A liver function test (LFT) is a set of several blood tests,
    measuring a range of different metabolic processes in the
    liver. The liver is not only a physically large organ, it
    also has a large range of metabolic roles in the body.  The
    tests provide an overview of  liver functions; help to diagnose,
    and assess the severity of, liver disorders; serve as a precaution
    before and after starting medications with potential for
    liver toxicity; and to identify potential liver disease (for
    example, after exposure to a hepatitis virus, or <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol dependence</a>).</p>
<p>The set of LFT tests typically includes testing for:</p>
<p><i>BIL</i>; measuring bilirubin levels (see BIL test above)</p>
<p><i>ALT</i> (alanine aminotransferase); ALT is an enzyme mostly
    found in the liver that catalyses some basic steps in protein
    processing. High ALT levels are a marker for liver disease
    and damage and help to distinguish the causes for jaundice
    (liver or blood disorder).</p>
<p><i>AST</i> (aspartate aminotransferase); AST is an enzyme found
    in several body tissues such as red blood cells, liver, muscle
    tissue, pancreas and kidneys. AST catalyses some basic steps
    in the amino acid metabolism. High AST levels are indicative
    of acute liver damage (or damage to other tissues).</p>
<p><i>ALP</i> (alkaline phosphatase); ALP is an enzyme that catalyses
    removal of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> units from molecules
    and thus is part of the energy metabolism pathways. ALP is
    mostly found in the liver and in bone. High blood levels
    of ALP occur with a number of bone conditions (for example,
    Paget’s disease or bone <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>),
    with over-activity of the parathyroid glands, lack of vitamin
    D, and liver damage (including liver <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastases</a>).
    Accordingly, ALP test results have to be interpreted in conjunction
    with results from other test, in particular ALT and AST.</p>
<p><i>Albumin</i>; albumin is the most common protein circulating
    in blood plasma; it is mainly synthesized in the liver. Albumin
    binds to many different substrates, cell surfaces, water
    molecules, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>,
    hormones, bilirubin, thyroxine which is necessary for its
    central role in regulating the osmotic pressure of blood
    (which in turn is essential for the transport properties
    of blood). Low levels of albumin occur with liver disease,
    malnutrition and some malignancies; high levels of albumin
    are usually related to dehydration.</p>
<h2>Ferritin (iron imbalance)</h2>
<p>Ferritin is a very large protein molecule that acts as an iron
    storage unit in cells and it releases iron ions as needed
    and normally maintains a balance between iron over- and underload.
    Ferritin is a universal protein in nearly all living organisms,
    to all of which free Fe ions would be toxic.</p>
<p>Increased levels of ferritin in blood can indicate iron overload
    disorders (such as haemochromatosis), liver disease and also
    infections or malignancies (the toxins released in the presence
    of these conditions upregulate the ferritin production).</p>
<p>Low levels of ferritin in blood serum are a specific marker for
    iron deficiency anaemia. Other conditions leading to low
    ferritin levels include low activity of the thyroid gland,
    lack of vitamin C, coeliac disease; vegetarians often have
    low ferritin levels.</p>
<p>Care needs to be taken in interpreting the results of a ferritin
    test, given the opposing trends in serum ferritin levels
    from conditions that may be present simultaneously.</p>
