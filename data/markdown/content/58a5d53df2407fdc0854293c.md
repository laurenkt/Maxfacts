<h1 id="nicotine">Nicotine</h1>
<p>Nicotine is a small organic molecule that can transgress the
    blood-brain barrier.</p>

<p>In the brain, the nicotine molecules bind to a specific type
    of receptor sites, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
    and induce a cascade of biochemical reactions that ultimately
    cause the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine and a
    few other chemicals (e.g. serotonin and beta-endorphin).
    Neurotransmitters are chemicals that communicate information
    from one neuron to another in the brain, enabling the brain
    to control body functions. Dopamine is involved in several
    such information pathways of the brain, particularly with
    a system known as the reward-motivated behaviour. Most pleasurable
    reward reactions are related to increased dopamine release
    in the brain and nearly all addictive substances have the
    effect of increasing dopamine release in the brain.</p>
<p>Nicotine is probably one of the best researched and investigated
    addictive drugs, and yet there remain many questions about
    its biochemical and physiological roles, especially about
    its psychoactive actions. Some of the difficulties with disentangling
    these effects originate in the combined effects of nicotine
    and its different modes of intake. For example, when smoking
    tobacco another chemical, acetaldehyde, is ingested from
    the smoke. Acetaldehyde is thought to inhibit enzymes that
    break down dopamine, thus perpetuating its ‘reward effects’.
    Nicotine has some other strange properties as far as addictive
    substances are concerned: at low dose it acts as a stimulant
    whereas at high dose it is a sedative (this behaviour may
    be related to serotonin release).</p>
<p>Not only is nicotine an addictive substance, it also leads to
    an effect known as tolerance. Regular consumption causes
    the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to become saturated
    (entirely occupied by nicotine molecules). Consequently,
    the blocked receptors cannot respond anymore to their normal
    substrate. The body attempts to compensate for this by so-called
    neuroadaptation, which involves the production of more receptors.
    Cravings occur during periods of abstinence when more receptors
    become sensitive again and cravings are only relieved when
    more nicotine is absorbed and binds to the receptors. Tolerance
    mechanisms are the most likely explanation why for most nicotine
    consumers attempts at reducing the intake fail.</p>
<p>In addition to a pleasurable ‘reward’ for nicotine consumption
    from dopamine release, other receptors create effects that
    cause the typical nicotine withdrawal symptoms. For example,
    corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) is a hormone that binds
    to its receptor (CRF1) to mediate responses to stress. CRF
    release occurs at elevated levels when abstaining from nicotine,
    resulting in increased anxiety. Both stress and anxiety are
    difficult obstacles to overcome when trying to stop using
    nicotine. Nicotine withdrawal systems do diminish over time.</p>
<p>Apart from its addictive power and some adverse effects on the
    cardiovascular and digestive systems, nicotine ingested at
    modest levels is not thought to be particularly harmful (except
    for its adverse effects on the development of a foetus).
    That is the underlying reasoning for smoke-less nicotine
    replacement therapies, one of many different approaches and
    attempts to supporting smokers who try to kick the habit:
    nicotine provision is made for cravings by delivery by, for
    example, release through skin patches while avoiding the
    harmful effects of smoking.</p>
<h1 id="tobacco">Tobacco</h1>
<p>The most common way to use nicotine is <em>via</em> some preparation
    of tobacco leaves. Besides nicotine, tobacco leaves contain
    a multitude of other chemical compounds that are consumed
    alongside nicotine. Some of these compounds are harmful.
    For example, some tobacco preparations contain (low concentrations
    of) nitrosamines, a type of chemical that is carcinogenic.
    Processed tobacco leaves are consumed in many ways, as snuff
    (continental Europe), chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco (North
    America), snus (Scandinavia) and most commonly: smoking in
    the form of cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, in a pipe, in
    a shisha / hookah / waterpipe (Middle East and Indian subcontinent).
    A smokeless way to inhale nicotine is the more recent method
    of vaping (electronic cigarettes) where a liquid mixture
    of water, nicotine, some glycerine and flavouring are heated
    and the resulting vapour is inhaled.</p>
<p><strong>Snuff</strong> is a traditional, smoke-less way to consume
    tobacco / nicotine, common all over the world. Snuff uses
    pulverised, fermented tobacco leaves. The preparations range
    from very fine, dry powders to slightly coarser textures
    which usually are moister. Many snuff preparations are flavoured
    (menthol, amongst many other flavourings), many are matured
    for extended periods and there are many traditionally established
    local varieties and flavours. A traditional Bavarian, powerful
    version of snuff is called ‘Schmalzler’ because it used to
    be refined with clarified butter (Butterschmalz). The Bavarians
    also invented supersized, colourful handkerchiefs for the
    discerning snuff user – big enough to cope with major sneezing
    attacks following a good ‘snuffing’, but equally suitable
    to cover the (bald) head as a sun protection in summer or
    to double up as a scarf in winter.</p>
<p>Snuff is, - snuffed: a pinch of the material is snuffed up from
    the back of the hand into the nose, which takes a little
    bit of practice. Uptake through the nasal mucosa provides
    a shortcut for nicotine to the brain where it is delivered
    within seconds. Snuffing is usually immediately followed
    by a mighty sneeze. Snuff is considered a slightly less harmful
    way of consuming tobacco because it avoids the harmful effects
    of smoking. Nevertheless, addiction to nicotine remains and
    long-term snuffing damages the nasal mucosa.</p>
<p><strong>Chewing tobacco</strong> is another smoke-less way to
    consume tobacco / nicotine. It is prepared from fermented
    tobacco leaves that are either cut into strips (like pipe
    tobacco), or more finely cut and pressed into plugs or pellets.
    These require chewing to release flavour and nicotine. This
    form of tobacco / nicotine consumption seems to have fallen
    out of fashion of late.</p>
<p><strong>Snus</strong> (traditional in Scandinavia, especially
    Sweden) and <strong>dipping tobacco</strong> (traditional
    in North America) are two similar varieties of moist pastes
    made from milled tobacco leaves. These preparations use tobacco
    preparations that are less, or not at all, fermented than
    typical tobacco preparations for snuff or smoking tobaccos.
    Some snus preparations are flavoured and there are fortified
    snus versions with enhanced nicotine content. Snus is normally
    packed in small pouches that are placed between lip and gum
    for long periods of time. Nicotine is then continually released
    and taken up via the oral mucosa. Continued oral consumption
    of tobacco preparations in chewing tobacco, snus or dipping
    tobacco have all been shown to lead to <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease (gum disease)</a>    and other lesions of the oral mucosa. It is thought that
    increased risks of oral, oesophageal and pancreatic cancers
    are related to oral smoke-less tobacco / nicotine consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Smoking tobacco</strong> in some way is by far the most
    common form of nicotine consumption worldwide. It is also
    the most harmful form of nicotine consumption and has been
    identified as the ‘biggest avoidable cause of death on the
    planet’.</p>
<p>In addition to the addictive properties of nicotine, inhaling
    the smoke from combusting fermented &amp; dried tobacco leaves
    is seriously harmful. Of the known ca. 4000 different chemicals
    in tobacco smoke, at least ca. 100 are known to be carcinogens.
    Many of these are contained in the tar that is formed by
    incomplete combustion and inhaled. Other substances in the
    inhaled smoke are simply toxic, for example heavy metal ions
    (lead and arsenic), or carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.
    Continued exposure to smoke, especially accumulation of the
    tar components, damages the lining of the windpipe and lungs
    (the respiratory epithelium). It harms the motile cilia,
    surface structures of cells that are normally responsible
    for clearing dirt and mucus from the lungs (smoker’s cough).</p>
<p>Inhaling tobacco smoke has been shown to cause lung cancers and
    other incurable lung conditions, to increase the risk for
    head and neck malignancies, to cause damage to the cardiovascular
    system and to increase the risk of coronary artery disease,
    stroke and heart failure. Very recently, an extended mapping
    of genetic fingerprints has identified <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/further-reading">multiple mutational genetic signatures of human cancers</a>    associated with tobacco smoking, including head and neck
    cancers.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps some extra-motivation to quit smoking</strong>    when confronted with oral and maxillofacial surgery: if the
    above list of proven general adverse effects of tobacco smoking
    does not provide sufficient motivation to try and give up,
    perhaps the following facts are worth to ‘think about’ when
    faced with major surgery. Tobacco smoke acts as a vasoconstrictor
    (narrowing of blood vessels) and thus reduces blood supply
    to tissues. Short term, this has negative effects on wound
    healing, which in turn increases the risk of infections.
    The post-operative thrombosis risk is significantly higher
    for smokers (not just deep vein thrombosis but also blockage
    of blood vessels at surgical sites). Bone and/or soft tissue
    grafts and flaps have a significantly higher risk of failure
    for smokers. Continued tobacco smoking significantly reduces
    the chances of success of <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>:
    reduced oxygen-levels make tumour cells less susceptible
    to destruction by high-energy photons. Long term, continued
    exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of recurrence
    of malignancies, and/or the occurrence of new malignancies.</p>

    <p>In the UK, many institutions and charities offer <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/further-reading">support</a>        in non-judgmental ways with the management of addictions
        as well as offering help with attempts to terminate substance
        abuse – <strong>including support for smoking cessation</strong>.</p>
