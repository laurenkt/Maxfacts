    surgery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>lasers (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation);</li>
    <li>diathermy and coblation;</li>

<h1 id="laser-light-amplification-by-stimulated-emission-of-radiation">Laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation)</h1>
<h2>The basic principles of a laser</h2>
<p>A laser is an artificial source of light, not necessarily in
    the visible range of electromagnetic radiation. A laser differs
    from a normal light source in that it emits monochromatic
    (only one wavelength) and coherent (all waves are in phase)
    light waves (Figure 1). This type of coherent radiation can
    be exploited to generate intense and highly focussed beams
    of light with a precisely defined energy, a property that
    is highly desirable for a wide range of technical applications,
    including surgery.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Top: radiation waves with a defined
        wavelength and amplitude, same phase (left) and different
        phases (right); middle: a conventional light source (such
        as an incandescent lightbulb) emitting a range of different
        wavelengths, with random phases; bottom: coherent monochromatic
        radiation waves as emitted from a laser, these can be
        either continuous (left) or pulsed (right) wave packets.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most lasers can be operated in two different modes, continuous
    or pulsed. In continuous mode, an uninterrupted wave with
    a constant output is emitted. In surgical applications, this
    continuous-output, low-power (3 to 30 W) mode is very useful
    for cutting and ablation of tissues. In pulsed mode, an interrupted
    emission with set time periods for pause and emission allows
    for large amounts of energy to be delivered in a very short
    period of time (in surgical applications typically in excess
    of 100 W). This mode of delivery leads to mechanical disruption
    of tissues rather than thermal effects (laser lithotripsy,
    the breaking up of kidney stones or other calculi, being
    an example).</p>
<p>The laser phenomenon relies on a fundamental property of electrons,
    the particles that hold molecules and materials together
    by forming chemical bonds and by providing the negatively
    charged shell surrounding the positively charged nucleus
    of atoms. Electrons, like all other microscopic particles,
    obey the laws of quantum mechanics which require that electrons
    can only occupy certain discrete energy states / energy levels.
    Using the analogy of a staircase, an electron can be moved
    up from one step to the next by providing the appropriate
    amount of energy (absorption) to bridge the gap (Figure 2).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> An electron being moved from its
        ground energy level to a higher (exited) energy level,
        here by energy input from a light source (photons).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The reverse process of an electron transferring from a higher
    energy level to a lower energy level releases the corresponding
    amount of energy in the form of emitting light (photon).
    The return of an electron from a higher energy level to its
    ground state, lower energy level usually occurs spontaneously
    (spontaneous emission) without external influences or triggers.
    However, there is another mechanism of return to the energetic
    ground state, stimulated emission. This mechanism also leads
    to emission of a photon of energy corresponding to the energy
    gap, but the process is triggered / initiated by the interaction
    of the electron in its higher energy state with a suitable
    package of energy (typically in the form of light). This
    mechanism of stimulated emission of radiation (Figure 3)
    is the underlying principle that enables the construction
    of lasers with a very wide range of properties.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The two mechanisms of return to
        the energetic ground state of an electron; left: spontaneous
        emission, right: stimulated emission.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to exploit this mechanism of stimulated emission for
    the construction of a device that emits monochromatic, coherent
    radiation – a laser – there are three necessary components
    (Figure 4):</p>
<ul>
    <li>An <strong>energy source</strong> for the initial input of
        large amounts of energy promoting many electrons in the
        active medium into higher energy levels; this could be
        an optical (flash lamp, or another laser), electrical
        or chemical source of energy.</li>
    <li>An <strong>active medium</strong>; a collection of atoms
        or molecules in the gas, liquid or solid phase. The active
        medium absorbs the energy from the excitation energy
        source and undergoes stimulated emission. The exact nature
        of the active medium determines the wavelength a particular
        laser emits.</li>
    <li>An <strong>optical cavity</strong>, consisting of two mirrors
        placed parallel to each other and allowing the stimulating
        photons to travel back and forth multiple times, amplifying
        the production of monochromatic and coherent radiation.
        One of the mirrors is constructed such that it permits
        controlled release of the amplified, focussed, directional
        laser beam from the optical cavity.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The basic components of a laser.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Over the years, lasers have been constructed and optimised with
    many different properties and applications in mind, including
    extremely narrow bandwidth of emitted electromagnetic radiation,
    extremely short pulses (crucial to study very fast processes
    in biological and chemical systems), extremely powerful pulses,
    covering a very wide range of frequencies with different
    lasers, creating directed laser beams that preserve coherence
    over incredibly long distances (important in space sciences).
    Lasers, therefore, find use across a wide range of applications
    – from the scanner of the supermarket cash point, to military
    purposes, industrial applications such as welding and cutting,
    to high-precision spectroscopy tools and medical applications.</p>
<h2>Lasers in oral and maxillofacial surgery</h2>
<p>In common with all other interactions of electromagnetic radiation
    with matter (including living biological systems), there
    are four main mechanisms how a laser beam interacts with
    matter: transmittance, absorbance, reflection and scattering
    (Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The four main interactions of
        radiation with matter.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The most relevant interaction mode for surgical applications
    of lasers is absorbance, with some additional aspects of
    transmission also important for functionality.</p>
<p>Lasers used in surgical applications employ a small range (Figure
    6) of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, approximately
    covering the range from infrared to ultraviolet electromagnetic
    radiation.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> The frequency/wavelength range
        of lasers for surgical applications.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This frequency/wavelength range is suitable for a range of different
    surgical applications. When laser light is absorbed by biological
    material, there is a transfer of energy (for example, from
    light to heat). If selective absorption occurs for certain
    frequencies/wavelengths in selected tissue types, the amount
    of damage to surrounding tissues is minimised. Different
    specific lasers, with optimal properties for different surgical
    purposes are in use clinically. Figure 7 summarises the most
    important absorbance characteristics of the main targets
    (chromophores: water, melanin (a pigment in skin), haemoglobin
    (the component of <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">blood</a>    carrying oxygen molecules around the body), together with
    the types of lasers with emission characteristics in the
    respective frequency/wavelength windows.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Summary of the absorption characteristics
        of water, melanin and haemoglobin for different frequencies/wavelengths
        of radiation. frequency/wavelength range of lasers for
        surgical applications.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main absorbance characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>melanin – ultraviolet, visible and some regions of infrared
        radiation;</li>
    <li>haemoglobin – ultraviolet, and green and yellow components
        of visible light;</li>
    <li>water – strong absorption in the infrared and ultraviolet
        regions of radiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Absorption occurs through three main categories of interaction
    between tissues and laser photons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>photo-thermal effects – conversion of radiation energy to
        heat (useful for <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">coagulation</a>        and cutting of tissues);</li>
    <li>photo-chemical effects – inducing a chemical reaction in
        tissue (<a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>        utilises this effect);</li>
    <li>photo-ablation – direct damage to biological structures by
        high-energy radiation effects without heating effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important factor to consider in surgical laser applications
    is thermal relaxation. Thermal relaxation is defined as the
    time required for the temperature of the absorbing chromophore
    (unit) to cool to half of its maximum temperature after the
    application of laser radiation. This relaxation rate is directly
    related to the size of the unit (faster cooling for smaller
    units than for bigger ones) and to the properties of surrounding
    tissues. In order to avoid thermal damage to surrounding
    tissues, the pulse duration of laser irradiation must be
    shorter than the thermal relaxation time.</p>
<p>By and large, advantages and disadvantages of lasers compared
    with other surgical techniques can be summarised as</p>
<ul>
    <li>advantages – high precision for cutting soft tissues; reduced
        bleeding; sterilisation effect (‘sanitised surgical wound’);</li>
    <li>disadvantages – thermal damage to surrounding tissues; lack
        of haptic feedback on penetration depth during execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>As summarised in Figure 7 (see above), the commonest lasers used
    in oral and maxillofacial surgery are CO<sub>2</sub>, Nd:YAG,
    Er:YAG, argon and (a variety of) diode lasers. These types
    of lasers are described below.</p>
<p>The active medium of a <strong>CO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong>    <strong>laser</strong> consists of gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>    (carbon dioxide), He (helium) and Ar (argon). The emitted
    light has a wavelength of 10,600 nm. Water is the only biological
    chromophore that absorbs radiation at 10,600 nm. The strong
    absorption by water molecules limits the penetration depth
    of this laser to a fraction of a mm. The main effect is photo-thermal:
    the energy absorbed by water molecules is converted to heat
    (when the temperature of the water in tissue reaches 100
    ºC, water vapour forms and this volume expansion results
    in tissue fragmentation and, therefore, cutting. The CO<sub>2</sub>    laser is considered the surgical workhorse amongst the various
    lasers, its main application is for cutting and vaporisation
    (for example, in the removal of premalignant lesions of skin
    or mucosa) of soft tissues, in particular the tongue. The
    CO<sub>2</sub> laser can be used in conjunction with a microscope
    in conventional (‘open’) oral and maxillofacial surgery but
    is also compatible with <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/tors">transoral robotic surgery approaches, TORS</a>.
    Resection of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">tongue base and posterior pharyngeal malignancy</a>    using laser <i>via</i> TORS can obviate the more invasive
    approach of labiomandibulotomy (splitting of lip and mandible
    to gain access) in open surgery.</p>
<p>The active medium of a <strong>Er:YAG laser</strong> consists
    of an yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG) crystal, doped with
    a small amount of erbium, Er. The emitted light has a wavelength
    of 2940 nm. This wavelength is strongly absorbed by water
    molecules as well as by hydroxyl apatite (the mineral component
    of bone), enabling the Er:YAG laser as a cutting tool for
    bone. The main effect of the Er:YAG laser on soft tissue
    is photo-thermal, but photo-mechanical (cracking of the bone
    matrix) effects dominate in hard tissue.</p>
<p>The active medium of a <strong>Nd:YAG laser</strong> consists
    of an yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG) crystal, doped with
    a small amount of neodymium, Nd. The emitted light has a
    wavelength of 1060 nm. Both haemoglobin and melamin strongly
    absorb this wavelength of radiation, which is responsible
    for both the strong photo-thermal effect and the strong haemostatic
    (reducing bleeding) effect of the Nd:YAG laser at low power
    (ca. 30 W). Hence, this laser is predominantly used for its
    coagulation effects, but cutting can also be achieved by
    using it in contact mode with a carbon tip, or using a combination
    of a Nd:YAG with a CO<sub>2</sub> laser. The Nd:YAG laser
    has a role in surgical interventions where there is a risk
    of serious bleeding from deficient blood coagulation, either
    by a <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">range of diseases</a>    or related to <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a>.</p>
<p>The active medium of a <strong>diode laser</strong> consists
    of a semi-conductor, doped with gallium, Ga, or arsenic,
    As. The wavelength produced depends on the precise nature
    of the semi-conductor material used but is typically in the
    region 810 to 980 nm. This wavelength is strongly absorbed
    by melanin but poorly absorbed by water molecules. The main
    role of diode lasers is in achieving coagulation, applications
    in the treatment of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants/more-info">peri-implantitis</a>    have been reported, quoting antimicrobial effects. Diode
    lasers with light emission in the visible red light region
    are used in <a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>    . In maxillofacial surgery, there was a period when temporfin
    was the photosensitizing agent used in photodynamic therapy
    of specific cases of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oral and oro-pharyngeal cancer</a>    but this application has stopped in the UK. after NICE found
    insufficient evidence to support the technique. However,
    photodynamic therapy is a technique, with different photosensitizing
    agents, that continues to be used on <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">skin cancers</a>    .</p>
<p>The active medium of a <strong>blue diode laser</strong> can
    be a number of different semi-conductor materials; the active
    medium of the blue diode laser emitting a wavelength of 445
    nm consists of a particular gallium-indium-nitride (GaInN)
    material. This particular diode laser is gaining popularity,
    as it is becoming increasingly economical and has some distinct
    advantages over other diode lasers operating in the infrared
    region of radiation. It features high absorbance in most
    soft tissues by melanin and haemoglobin, but poor absorption
    by water molecules, contributing to its effectiveness at
    very low powers. Excellent soft tissue healing has been reported
    after ablation and in contrast to lasers working in the ultraviolet
    region of radiation, the blue diode laser radiation has no
    adverse effects on DNA (or other) molecules in cells. The
    blue diode laser is a relatively recent addition to the surgical
    toolbox, its main advantages and disadvantages still need
    further investigations.</p>
<p>The active medium of an <strong>argon laser</strong> is slightly
    different in that it is made up of an ionised noble gas argon,
    Ar. The argon laser emits radiation in the range 250 to 520
    nm (depending on the exact preparation conditions) which
    is strongly absorbed by haemoglobin and melamin. A major
    application area for this type of laser is in eye surgery
    (for example, repairing a ruptured retina), otherwise it
    is used in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities">vascular surgery</a>.</p>
<h1 id="diathermy-and-coblation">Diathermy and coblation</h1>
<p>The working principles of diathermy and coblation, relying on
    an electrical current, revolve around the basic laws of physics
    relating current (the amount of moving charges (electrons)
    per time unit), voltage (the potential energy difference
    between two points in a circuit, the driving force for a
    current) and resistance (the tendency of a material to hinder
    the flow of charge) with each other.</p>
<h2>Diathermy</h2>
<p>The term diathermy refers to the cutting and coagulation of body
    tissue using a high frequency electrical current, resulting
    in tissue heating. An electric generator creates a voltage,
    the alternating current (AC) used is in the frequency range
    100 kHz to 5 MHz (radiofrequency range) for electrosurgical
    applications. Using a frequency above 100 kHz is advantageous
    because neuromuscular stimulation ceases at this frequency;
    therefore, postoperative pain, swelling and spasms can be
    minimised.</p>
<p>When a current is supplied to tissues in the body, the tissues
    provide resistance and heat is produced locally (similar
    to the way a traditional light bulb works). The heat generated
    from this resistance results in localised boiling of intracellular
    fluid and this phenomenon enables the tissue to be cut.</p>
<p>Current density is also important and is related to resistance.
    Current density is the amount of current per unit area. Varying
    the current density changes the amount of heating (due to
    the relationship with resistance). Resistance is also proportional
    to size: the resistance increases as the area decreases.
    Surgical tools utilise this effect by having a small tip,
    which produces a large current density and large amounts
    of heat at the surgical site. Conversely, the return electrode
    in monopolar diathermy (see below) has a small current density
    because its surface area is large.</p>
<p>There are two main modes of diathermy, monopolar and bipolar.</p>
<p>In <strong>monopolar diathermy</strong>, the active electrode
    is at the surgical site but the return plate/ electrode is
    elsewhere on the body (usually around the thigh). The surgical
    tool introduces the electric current at the surgical site
    and the current passes through the body, which completes
    the circuit between the active electrode and return electrode
    (Figure 8). The Colorado needle is a variant of a monopolar
    diathermy instrument with a particularly sharp tip, designed
    for high precision cutting, dissecting and coagulation.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure8.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> The basic principle of monopolar
        diathermy, showing the induction of an electrical current
        at the surgical site and the transfer of current to the
        return plate.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In <strong>bipolar diathermy</strong> the patient's body
    is not used to complete the circuit, the electrical current
    is localised at the surgical site. The current applied during
    bipolar diathermy only passes through tissue between the
    two arms of the forceps (surgical tool) (Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure9.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> The basic principle of bipolar
        diathermy, showing the induction of an electrical current
        at the surgical site and the transfer of current between
        the two arms of the forceps.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 10 depicts the actual surgical instruments used in mono-and
    bipolar diathermy.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-extreme-temperatures-level3-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Bipolar (top) and cutting monopolar
        (bottom) diathermy instruments.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The main use of monopolar diathermy is cutting of tissues, for
    example in tongue resections.  Bipolar diathermy is mainly
    used as a forceps, to coagulate small vessels, particularly
    when <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">flaps are being used in reconstructive surgery</a>.
    The so-called harmonic scalpel is a non-electrical alternative
    for simultaneous cutting and coagulation; its working principle
    is to apply <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasonic vibrations</a>.</p>
<h2>Coblation (controlled ablation)</h2>
<p>This technique is related to diathermy in that both techniques
    use alternating currents to achieve the desired effects.
    Unlike diathermy, coblation is not a heat-driven process.
    Instead of heating the tissue by a high-frequency alternating
    electrical current delivered directly to tissue as in diathermy,
    in coblation the radiofrequency is delivered to a conductive
    medium (for example, an aqueous solution of sodium chloride)
    surrounding the active electrode. This creates a medium known
    as a low-temperature plasma. Reaction of the plasma with
    surrounding water molecules creates highly reactive species
    (radicals, such as OH, O and H species with unpaired electrons).
    These short-lived reactive chemical species can break / disrupt
    chemical bonds in nearby tissues, with very little or no
    bleeding but with less-than-perfect control of the tissue
    removal achieved. Coblation is sometimes used in <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">parotidectomies</a>    (removal of the parotid gland (one of the major salivary
    glands)) or in <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">neck dissections</a>.</p>
<h1 id="cryotherapy">Cryotherapy</h1>
<p>Cryotherapy takes us to the extreme opposite of the temperature
    range by exploiting the very low temperature of liquid nitrogen,
    N<sub>2</sub> (-196 ºC).</p>
<p>Application of liquid N<sub>2</sub> leads to tissue destruction
    by direct and indirect routes. Direct routes involve the
    formation of ice crystals in fluid outside cells and within
    the cells, leading to localised cell membrane damage, inhibition
    of enzymes and protein damage, and ultimately to the destruction
    of the cells. All of these direct routes cause the cells
    exposed to liquid N<sub>2</sub> to swell and eventually to
    rupture because of the presence of water in cells. The underlying
    mechanism is the unique property of water, known as the water
    anomaly. Water is most dense at temperatures a little higher
    than its melting point of 0 °C. On further cooling (and freezing),
    its density reduces and, in consequence the volume expands
    in frozen water. This effect ensures the survival of fish
    in frozen lakes (as there will nearly always be liquid, albeit
    cold, water at the bottom of the lake) and explains the explosion
    of a bottle of beer (or other beverages) that one placed
    in the freezer for a quick cooling but forgot to remove after
    a short time. In cryotherapy, the water molecules in the
    cells initially contract on cooling, further cooling lets
    the ice crystals expand, leading to rupture of the cell (on
    perfect analogy to the forgotten beer bottle in the freezer).
    Indirect mechanisms of tissue destruction by cryotherapy
    include a stimulated <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune response</a>    and restricted blood flow in the treated area. All of these
    mechanisms can lead to tissue <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>.</p>
<p>Cryotherapy is mostly used for the removal of superficial (skin
    and mucosa) lesions, small <a href="/treatment/surgery/vascular-abnormalities">vascular lesions</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">mucoceles</a>    (a form of cyst), or <a href="/treatment/surgery/benign-lump/more-info">papillomata</a>.
    Another application of cryotherapy is in the treatment of
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">refractory and neuropathic pain</a>.
    If a clear diagnosis (for example, by applying a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">nerve block</a>)
    can be made and the nerve identified, applying liquid N<sub>2</sub>    to the nerve via a medium (usually petroleum jelly) and repeating
    a cycle of freezing and thawing a few times, will damage
    the nerve enough to typically lead to several months of non-function
    of the nerve, with the beneficial side-effect that the nerve
    will also be unable to transfer pain signals. It should be
    noted, though, that the evidence for the treatment of neuropathic
    pain by cryotherapy is slim and in part controversial.</p>
