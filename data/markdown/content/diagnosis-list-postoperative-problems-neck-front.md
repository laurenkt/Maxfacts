<p>Postoperative problems affecting the front of the neck include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars. Unlike in the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/neck-back">back of the neck</a>        these are easy to see and manage. Equally they are more
        obvious as the front of the neck is a continuation of
        the face in social interactions.</li>
    <li>Limitation of movement. This may be compounded by a flap
        replacing an area of missing neck skin. This is designed
        to minimise any limitation of movement but this can take
        many weeks or months to be fully effective.</li>
    <li>Stoma. A laryngectomy (removal of the voice box) requires
        a permanent tracheostomy – a breathing hole where the
        end of the windpipe is connected to the skin. Most maxillofacial
        patients have a temporary tracheostomy when undergone
        major resective <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer">surgery for cancer</a>        or after <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/more-info">significant facial trauma</a>.
        This is kept open by a tube which is removed after 4
        or 5 days. The hole seals under a dressing and voice
        is retained.</li>
    <li>Missing salivary glands. Surprisingly having one or more
        major salivary gland removed does not noticeably reduce
        the amount of available saliva.</li>
    <li>Limitation of movement of the hyoid bone (at the root of
        the tongue, in the front of the neck). This can interfere
        with swallowing as this bone has to lift up as part of
        the <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallowing process</a>.</li>
    <li>Missing lymph glands. These are removed as part of <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer">cancer treatment</a>.
        Although this disrupts the flow of lymph and can cause
        tissue swelling (lymphoedema) and the lymph nodes are
        part of the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune system</a>,
        their removal does not seem to have an obvious damaging
        effect on the body’s response to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>.</li>
