<p>Many of the oral and maxillofacial conditions afflicting those
    suffering from haematological malignancies are not unique
    to these underlying haematological conditions or their treatment
    and thus are discussed in various different sections of the
    website, regarding <a href="/diagnosis">diagnosis</a> and
    <a href="/treatment">treatment</a>. There are, however, some
    specific considerations associated with oral and maxillofacial
    conditions in the context of haematological malignancies
    and their treatments.</p>
<p>Therefore, below we give a sketch of conditions and specific
    considerations and will point the reader to further appropriate
    sections of the website for more detailed information.</p>
<h1 id="biopsies-and-other-surgical-interventions">Biopsies and other surgical interventions</h1>
<p>The main role for oral and maxillofacial surgery in <strong>support of diagnosis</strong>    of haematological malignancies is to provide a range of
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsies</a>. Most commonly, these are excision biopsies
        of cervical (neck) lymph nodes, excision of <a href="/treatment/surgery/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">salivary glands</a>,
        in some cases incisional biopsies or oral mucosal biopsies.
        Over time, some may have to be repeated.</p>
<p>In <strong>support of treatment</strong>, rarely <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">facial skin lesions</a>    are related to haematological malignancy and are initially
    excised by a maxillofacial surgeon. Equally, isolated deposits
    of rare lymphoma (mucosally-associated lymphoma, salivary-associated
    lymphoma) may be treated by excision of the lump or associated
    gland. This is always in conjunction with a haematological
    malignancy specialist and specialist pathology input.</p>
<h1 id="management-of-various-dental-and-oral-conditions-before-and-during-cancer-treatment">Management of various dental and oral conditions before and during
    cancer treatment</h1>
<p>If time permits, a careful assessment of dental status and management
    according to status before starting chemo- or radiotherapy
    treatment is best practice. The main driving force behind
    this approach ahead of cancer treatment(s) is the attempt
    to avoid dental and other oral infections and/or the need
    for invasive dental treatments during and after cancer treatment.
    Systemic treatment schemes of malignancies increase the risk
    for infections, with the oral cavity particularly at risk.
    This is generally true for chemo- or radiotherapy treatment
    of haematological and other malignancies. The main difference
    here is the slightly different demographics of patients with
    haematological malignancies, with a larger sub-group of young
    children amongst the patients than is typically the case
    for other malignancies.</p>
<h2>Before oncological treatment starts</h2>
<p>For adults, the main focus is on identifying and treating
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal disease</a> and other chronic oral <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammation</a>,
        identifying and treating (<a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">root canal treatment</a>)
        or extracting teeth that may otherwise cause problems
        later on, or may require invasive dental treatments.
        This general optimisation attempt extends to include
        <a href="/rest-dentistry-implants-level1">dentures and other prostheses such as dental implants</a>.
        The second pillar for optimisation aims to establish
        best possible <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>;
        this typically includes help (and guidance) by a professional
        dental therapist but otherwise relies on informed self-management.
        Self-management in turn extends from oral hygiene to
        include an <a href="/help/oral-food">optimised diet</a>        (see below).</p>
<p>For children, the overall approach is very similar. The main
    difference is that problematic primary teeth in poor condition
    are usually removed, secondary dentition in children at this
    stage is managed in the same way as for adults. As a rule
    of thumb, dental decay of teeth not affecting the pulp calls
    for restoration. Dental decay of a primary tooth affecting
    the pulp is a reason to extract the tooth. For permanent
    teeth, dental decay affecting the pulp may call for extraction
    (if severe) or <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">root canal treatment</a>.
    Extensive dental work in young children may have to be carried
    out under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>.
    A detailed protocol of dental and orofacial anatomical development
    before oncological treatment should be collated for later
    reference (see below).</p>
<p>For all ages, if possible / if time permits, tooth extractions
    should be carried out ideally three weeks before the start
    of oncological treatment such that any defects will have
    healed by then, or at least one week prior to the start of
    oncological treatment. An increased risk of serious <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding">bleeding</a>    after dental extractions in leukaemia patients mandates careful
    <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">local haemostasis</a>.
    When platelet counts in recent <a href="/diagnosis/tests/blood-tests">blood tests</a>    are low, platelet transfusions may be necessary. Cover by
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial agents</a>    is a common precaution in these circumstances. Extremely
    low platelet counts may make invasive dental treatment, or
    extractions, impossible.</p>
<p>Also for all ages, brushing teeth should be done with a supersoft
    toothbrush to avoid soft-tissue damage and bleeding. When
    platelet counts in blood tests are very low, it may be a
    good idea to avoid brushing and instead use a sponge or moist
    gauze for cleaning, alongside regular rinsing with saline
    mouth washes. Establishing and maintaining optimal oral hygiene
    is a major, mostly self-help based, contribution toward the
    best possible ways of coping with systemic oncological treatments
    (for haematological and other malignancies).</p>

<h2>During oncological treatment</h2>
<p>The focus is on attempts to maintain the best possible oral condition
    throughout oncological treatment, to avoid <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a> (see
    below). Undoubtedly, for some period of time this can be
    a daily struggle for many, given the common adverse effects
    of chemo- and/or radiotherapy, in particular oral mucositis
    (see below).</p>
<p>Maintaining good <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    becomes even more important throughout oncological treatment,
    for a number of reasons. High dose chemotherapies often are
    associated with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry mouth)</a>.
    Xerostomia in turn generally increases the risk for dental
    decay, as the <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/saliva-and-teeth-mucosa">protective action of saliva</a>    for teeth and soft oral tissues is reduced or lacking. Another
    potential cause for damage to teeth can be repeated vomiting
    caused by chemotherapy drugs (although effective antiemetic
    (anti-vomiting) agents are commonly used). With the onset
    of inflammation of the oral mucosa from chemo- and/or radiotherapy,
    maintaining good oral hygiene can become more challenging,
    and is even more important in managing mucositis and preventing
    oral infections (see below). An effective oral hygiene scheme
    at this stage should include the use of topical fluoride
    gels to enhance protection against <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a>    and frequent use of saline mouthwashes throughout the day.
    Another important contribution for optimised maintenance
    of oral conditions rests with the choice of <a href="/help/oral-food">oral foods</a>.
    A suitable soft or liquid diet (in the absence of irritating,
    mostly acidic, foods) and avoiding sugar can make all the
    difference between maintaining oral food intake or the temporary
    need to rely on a <a href="/help/non-oral-food">feeding tube</a>.
    Oral feeding over the period of oncological treatment may
    be impacted by <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">change or loss of taste</a>,
    in addition to problems caused by xerostomia and mucositis
    (see below).</p>
<p>Support for dental care during oncological treatment is usually
    provided in the settings of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative</a>    or paediatric dentistry departments associated with an oncology
    centre for the treatment of haematological malignancies.
    Management of mucosal conditions is one of the supportive
    roles of oral and maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>Follow-up dental care for children after the completion of haematological
    cancer treatments is equally important as the treatments
    can have a direct effect on the development of teeth (see
    below).</p>

<h1 id="assessment-and-management-of-mucositis"><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">Assessment</a>    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/oral-mucosal-lesions/detailed">management of mucositis</a></h1>
<p>Mucositis is a severe inflammation and painful ulceration of
    the mucosa, mostly affecting the oral mucosa. Mucositis occurs
    as a response to the cyctotoxic properties of chemo- and/or
    radiotherapies and is a serious adverse effect of these treatment
    modalities, with a high incidence. For example, severe oral
    mucositis occurs essentially in all chemo- and/or radiotherapy
    treatment schemes for head and neck malignancies. The incidence
    of acute and severe oral mucositis is also high, around 80
    %, during high-dose chemotherapy treatment for different
    forms of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">acute leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma</a>.
    Incidence and severity of oral mucositis tend to be highest
    for chemotherapies with <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy/chemical-principles">agents that affect DNA synthesis</a>,
    such as methotrexate. Such agents are widely used in radical
    chemotherapies in preparation for bone marrow stem cell transplants.
    Methotrexate is partially secreted by saliva, which may contribute
    to its causing severe oral mucositis.</p>
<p>Oral mucositis from chemotherapy typically starts one to two
    weeks after oncological treatment starts and may last for
    several weeks. Oral mucositis from radiotherapy is related
    to overall radiation dosage, with a threshold for onset of
    about 15 to 20 Gy accumulated radiation dosage. Experience
    would suggest that severe mucositis can take three months
    or even longer to fully settle after the completion of high
    dose external beam radiotherapy. It can take even longer
    if that regimen is rendered more toxic by the addition of
    chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Despite oral mucositis being a common and severe adverse effect
    of oncological treatment, there are no gold-standard approaches
    to prevent it, or significantly reduce its incidence or severity.
    Accordingly, the role of oral and maxillofacial surgery here
    is to manage the condition by</p>
<ul>
    <li>providing adequate pain control (<a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">local analgesics</a>        such as lidocaine or benzocaine, local analgesic and
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">anti-inflammatory agent</a>        benzydamine or other anti-inflammatory agents, and/or
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">systemic opioids analgesics</a>        such as morphine or fentanyl);</li>
    <li>maintaining integrity of the mucosa with an emphasis on preventing
        infection of oral ulcers (see below). Gel products that
        adhere to the mucosa can be used in conjunction with
        an analgesic and antiseptic mouthwash (pain relief followed
        by antisepsis, followed by a sealing ‘mucosal dressing’).
        Such gels can seal the weakened mucosa and reduce discomfort.
        Obviously avoiding direct trauma from sharp food stuffs,
        burns from over-heated drinks can reduce the risk of
        direct trauma and mucosal breach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oral mucositis may be so severe that it becomes a limiting condition
    for the oncological treatment. In severe cases, oral food
    intake is impossible and <a href="/help/non-oral-food">non-oral feeding</a>    methods may be necessary temporarily.</p>
<p>Many different treatments to alleviate the burden caused by oral
    mucositis have been suggested and tried; for most of these
    there is no convincing evidence of efficacy. The only exception
    with potential relevance is treatment with palifermin as
    a supportive agent. Palifermin is a synthetic growth factor
    with cytoprotective properties (by stimulating proliferation
    of mucosal cell lines, but not interfering with haematological
    cell lines and malignancies) and has been demonstrated to
    reduce incidence and severity of oral mucositis slightly.
    However, until very recently there was no evidence about
    any potential long-term effects with regard to enhanced risks
    of secondary malignancies developing later on, clearly a
    highly relevant consideration for young patients and children.
    Recent studies with a 15 year time horizon of observation
    showed no difference in safety and outcomes after oncological
    treatment of haematological malignancies with or without
    supportive palifermin treatment.</p>

        treatments schemes for the management of oral mucositis,

<h1 id="assessment-and-treatment-of-oral-infections"><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">Assessment</a> and
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/infection/more-info">treatment of oral infections</a></h1>
<p>Mucositis and associated oral ulcers are ideal breeding grounds
    for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">opportunistic oral infections</a>,
    especially so because of the immuno-compromised condition
    caused by chemotherapies. Neutropenia (reduction of the concentration
    of particular white blood cells that form an important part
    of the immune response to infections) is commonly observed.</p>
<p>The most common <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">viral infection is by herpes simplex</a>.
    The most common fungal infections are by <i>candida</i> species;
    with a compromised immune response such infections may become
    systemic and may even be fatal. A wide range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">bacterial infections</a>    occurs and is further facilitated by a reduced and incapacitated
    immune system. Oral infections in these circumstances can
    be severe, can cause local <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis</a>    and carry an increased risk of becoming systemic or developing
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/detailed">sepsis</a> and
    may be fatal. Common infective bacterial agents include <i>e. coli</i>,
    <i>pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>klebsiella</i> and <i>enterobacter</i>    species (many of which are normally commensal bacteria on
    the skin or in the digestive tract).</p>
<p>Clearly, prevention of oral infections is the first aim (see
    above). Failing that, any oral infections require determined
    interventions to control and eliminate the infection. This
    may include the need for <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microbiological identification</a>    of infective species for targeted selection of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">antibacterial agents</a>    in particular. Treatment approaches are very similar to those
    for <a href="/treatment/surgery/infection/more-info">serious oral infections in general</a>,
    with perhaps one notable exception. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">Chlorhexidine</a>    antibacterial mouthwash is generally widely used in the prevention
    and treatment of oral infections. Its use is not necessarily
    recommended during oncological treatment periods and for
    infections developing from mucositis ulcers, mainly because
    it is painful, particularly if a version containing alcohol
    is used.</p>
<h1 id="long-term-monitoring-and-interventions-after-completion-of-oncological-treatment">Long-term monitoring and interventions after completion of oncological
    treatment</h1>
<p>After completion of oncological treatment for haematological
    malignancies, several long-term monitoring and intervention
    roles for oral and maxillofacial surgery remain on the agenda.
    These are all in collaboration with oncology and restorative
    / paediatric dentistry.</p>
<p>Monitoring and diagnostic interventions (such as <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsies</a>)
    for relapse and/or for occurrence of secondary haematological
    and solid malignancies is part of the role. For example,
    the risk to develop a second primary head &amp; neck malignancy
    after leukaemia treatment is enhanced, with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">squamous cell carcinoma</a>    the most common following treatment with a bone marrow stem
    cell transplant.</p>
<p>Long-term maintenance and management are often concerned with
    symptoms of <a href="/diagnosis-list-tumour-haemtological-malignancy-level2">graft versus host disease</a>    after bone marrow cell stem transplants. The immune reactions
    associated with this complication lead to a chronic form
    of mucositis and an increased risk of oral infections (see
    above). This requires careful management as well as long-term
    monitoring of any developing white mucosal patches to detect
    any malignant transformations early. Graft <i>versus</i>    host disease may also give rise to long-standing <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia/detailed">xerostomia</a>    issues, resulting from inflammation and subsequent dysfunction
    of salivary glands. Such lasting xerostomia is managed in
    the same way as <a href="/treatment-surgery-xerostomia-level3">similar dry mouth problems arising from other causes</a>,
    such as following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    applied to the head &amp; neck region.</p>
<p>A special consideration is the long-term monitoring, support
    and treatment of children after leukaemia. Most children
    nowadays survive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the
    most common form of childhood cancers but delayed late toxicities
    mandate long-term monitoring and interventions in this group.
    Chemo- and radiotherapies at an age when tooth germs develop
    (before 5 years of age) stunt the development of permanent
    teeth and orofacial growth. The degree of dental abnormalities
    depends on dose and type of chemotherapy drugs and high-energy
    radiation. Most teeth of children in the age range up to
    5 years will be in a variable state of embryonic development
    during an intense period of chemo – and/or radiotherapy.
    These theapy-induced defects of the secondary teeth are permanent
    and can result in a greater need for input from restorative
    dentists throughout life.</p>
<p>Adverse long-term effects of chemo- and/or radiotherapies on
    the developing secondary dentition and orofacial growth,
    usually in need of treatment include</p>
<ul>
    <li>missing teeth, microdontia, stunted root growth of secondary
        teeth - may require / benefit from a range of <a href="/treatment/surgery/preprosthetic-surgery">preprosthetic surgical interventions</a>        and other surgical techniques used for <a href="/treatment/surgery/ectopic-teeth/detailed">treating ectopic (displaced) teeth</a>        in preparation for definitive <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative dentistry</a>        work, possibly including <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implants</a>;</li>
