<p>Prasugrel is one of several widely prescribed <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiplatelet">antiplatelet medications</a>,
    used to prevent thrombosis (blood clots) in arteries and
    arterioles. A common reason for long-term treatment with
    prasugrel, often in combination with low-dose <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/aspirin">aspirin</a>,
    is risk reduction for stroke and cardiovascular diseases.

<p>Prasugrel as depicted in Figure 1 is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">pro-drug</a>    that first needs to be converted to its active form once
    administered. Other than for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/clopidogrel">clopidogrel</a>,
    for prasugrel this chemical conversion to an active metabolite
    only requires hydrolysis and does not depend on the action
    of liver enzymes. Accordingly, prasugrel may be a more suitable
    choice of antiplatelet medication for people with reduced
    liver function. Also, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antacid">antacid medications</a>    (proton pump inhibitors, which suppress the production of
    stomach acid) do not reduce the antiplatelet activity of
    prasugrel (but antacid medications inhibit the activity of
    clopidogrel).</p>
<p>Once prasugrel is converted to its active metabolite, the active
    metabolite irreversibly blocks a receptor (a protein, P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>)
    that is found on the surface of platelets. P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>    is an important regulator protein in the cascade of reactions
    leading to blood clotting. Blocking P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub>    prevents the aggregation of platelets and thus the formation
    of a blood clot. The resulting, most prominent adverse effect
    of prasugrel (and other antiplatelet medications) is a tendency
    for excessive <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">bleeding</a>.
    The overall effects of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/clopidogrel">clopidogrel</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/ticagrelor">ticagrelor</a>    are similar to those of prasugrel, as all three drugs block
    the P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptors on the platelet
    surface. However, in most people prasugrel hinders platelet
    aggregation more rapidly and more profoundly than clopidogrel.</p>
<p>A tendency for excessive bleeding is obviously relevant for any
    oral and maxillofacial surgical interventions. As the effect
    of a dose of prasugrel persists for several days, wherever
    possible careful consideration needs to be given to modification
    of antiplatelet medication ahead of surgical interventions.
    This is possible for many elective procedures but obviously
    is not an option for trauma and other emergency situations
    leading to blood loss. In considering whether or not to modify
    antithrombotic or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/anticoagulant">anticoagulant medication</a>,
    an individual risk benefit analysis is needed. For most minor
    surgery local measures can control unwanted bleeding if the
    risk of modifying medication is high. The lack of effective
    reversal of these agents can also be problematic.</p>
