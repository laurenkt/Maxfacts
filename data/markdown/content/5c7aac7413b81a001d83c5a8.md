<p>General comments on indications and contraindications for surgical
    endodontics, success rates and alternative treatment by
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implants</a> are given. Some specific procedures (including
        incision and drainage, perforation repair, root and tooth
        resections, extraction with replantation, revision surgery)
        and aspects depending on specific areas of the mouth
        are outlined.</p>
<h2>Indications and contraindications for surgical endodontics</h2>
<p>The consensus report of the European Society of Endodontology
    suggests that endodontic surgery is indicated when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a canal is obstructed, for example with a separated instrument,
        and there are associated symptoms;</li>
    <li>extruded material is present with clinical symptoms, such
        as pain, that continue over a significant time period
        (at least one week);</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">conventional root canal treatment</a>        has failed and retreatment is inappropriate;</li>
    <li>perforation of the root or the floor of the pulp chamber
        has occurred, with radiological findings or clinical
        symptoms, and where repair from within the pulp cavity
        is not possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In almost all situations, conventional root canal treatment should
    be attempted first, and after a sufficient period of time
    the tooth is reassessed for further treatment. If the non-surgical
    root canal treatment has been performed to the highest practicable
    standard but symptoms persist, then surgical endodontic therapy
    may be appropriate. If, however, there have been procedural
    errors or there are technical deficiencies in the conventional
    root canal therapy, then conventional retreatment is indicated
    prior to considering surgery.</p>
<p>In some situations, it is impossible to revise the existing root
    filling, particularly when some of the older pastes have
    been used, even though ideally one would wish to do so. In
    these circumstances endodontic surgery is the only viable
    option to avoid extraction if symptomatic, but success rates
    are low.</p>
<p>Where a tooth has been restored with a post crown, the principles
    outlined above still apply, and attempts should usually be
    made at dismantling the post crown and instigating conventional
    retreatment. Occasionally, however, removal of a post may
    carry a significant risk of root fracture, and in such cases,
    it may be preferable to leave the post <i>in situ</i> and
    carry out surgical endodontic therapy.</p>
<p>Contraindications to surgical endodontic treatment include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>anatomical factors such as an inaccessible root-end;</li>
    <li>a tooth with a hopeless prognosis (for example, advanced
        loss of periodontal support) that cannot be made functional
        or does not contribute to aesthetics;</li>
    <li>a patient who does not provide informed consent to undergo
        the procedure;</li>
    <li>a patient with a compromised medical history, such as uncontrolled
        systemic disease (for example, diabetes or some <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">haematological disorders</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="success-rates">Success rates</h1>
<p>For <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">non-surgical endodontic treatment</a>,
    success rates of 86 to 96 % have been reported, and for retreatment
    60 to 98 %. Clinical success following surgical endodontic
    therapy has been reported to vary between 58 and 96 %. The
    wide range of reported success rates may be due to differences
    in evaluation criteria, diagnoses, operator skill and duration
    of follow-up periods.</p>
<p>Bacteria are the main cause of periradicular disease, with <i>enterococcus faecalis</i>    having been found to be the predominant microbial in failed
    cases and <i>actinomyces</i> species being able to survive
    in periapical tissues. An effective coronal seal is thought
    to improve success rates by reducing the viability of bacteria
    in the root canal system and the apical area.</p>
<p>Factors thought to improve success include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>position of the tooth in the arch, favouring anterior teeth;</li>
    <li>a well condensed orthograde root canal filling;</li>
    <li>a small apical lesion (less than 6 mm);</li>
    <li>use of an <a href="/diagnosis/tests/ultrasound">ultrasonic microtip</a>;</li>
    <li>first attempt at apical surgery for the tooth;</li>
    <li>use of an endoscope.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="alternative-treatments">Alternative treatments</h1>
<p>There are a number of ways in which non-vital teeth may be preserved.
    However, there is an increasing body of evidence supporting
    the long term viability of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implants</a>.
    Accordingly, atraumatic removal of such teeth with preservation
    of the maximum amount of healthy bone and immediate implant
    replacement may become the standard treatment for non-vital
    teeth which cannot be salvaged by conventional or surgical
    endodontics. It should be remembered that endodontic treatments,
    conventional and surgical, are perfectly valid techniques
    to preserve natural teeth and cost considerable less than
    dental implants.</p>
<h1 id="specific-procedures">Specific procedures</h1>
<h2>Incision and drainage</h2>
<p>Incision and drainage are one of the few surgical procedures
    which should be performed in the presence of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">acute inflammation</a>.
    The main indication for incision and drainage is the presence
    of pus within the tissues that cannot be drained through
    the root canal. Anaesthesia is obtained with the use of
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">surface analgesics</a>, which can be supplemented with a
        few drops of local anaesthetic solution injected submucosally.
        An incision is made with a number 11 scalpel blade (a
        blade with a sharp pointed tip), a microbial swab is
        taken and drainage affected. Alternatively, a wide bore
        needle and sterile syringe can be used to aspirate the
        contents of the swelling and culture and sensitivity
        testing carried out. In practical terms it will be days
        before the results of these <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microbiological tests</a>        are available. If there is no drainage, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>        such as a penicillin and/or metronidazole should be used.
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">Significant infection</a>        beyond the confines of the dentoalveolar complex mandates
        aggressive antibacterial treatment in addition to adequate
        drainage.</p>
<h2>Treatment of specific areas of the mouth</h2>
<p>Specific areas of the mouth pose various difficulties during
    apical surgery, and an understanding of the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">local anatomy</a>    is of immense importance when considering surgery.</p>
<p>In the treatment of <strong>upper anterior teeth</strong>, reflection
    of the flap to provide adequate access to the apex of upper
    central incisor teeth can be compromised by a prominent and/or
    low anterior nasal spine. Extension of the flap around more
    teeth and increasing the size of any relieving incisions
    often allows sufficient access to perform the surgery. The
    apices of upper lateral incisors can be deeply placed in
    the alveolar bone, which makes identification of the apex
    and access for apical surgery more difficult. The roots of
    upper canine teeth are occasionally very long and access
    to the apex may be restricted by the buccal reflection. Again,
    adequate relieving incisions help overcome this.</p>
<p>The maxillary <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">sinus</a> is often
    in close relation to the apices of <strong>upper posterior teeth</strong>,
    but a careful surgical technique will avoid damage to the
    sinus. It is advisable to burr down the root apex to the
    desired level, rather than resecting it, so that the resected
    tip cannot be displaced into the sinus or under its lining.</p>
<p>Apical surgery on upper first premolar teeth can be challenging
    because of the deeply placed palatal root. It may be necessary
    to resect a greater length of the buccal root than normal
    to provide sufficient access to the palatal root. The upper
    second premolar tooth is usually single-rooted, but there
    may be two separate root canals or two canals joined by an
    isthmus. In these situations, it is important that both canals,
    together with any isthmus of tissue that may be present,
    are sealed. Access to the palatal root of upper molars is
    almost impossible, but fortunately the palatal root is readily
    treated by <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">conventional endodontics</a>.
    The buccal roots are normally fairly superficial but occasionally
    they are deeply placed beneath the zygomatic buttress.</p>
<p>The apices of the <strong>lower anterior teeth</strong> are usually
    deeply placed in the mandible, which makes access extremely
    difficult. In addition, the mentalis and buccinator muscles
    are attached at a relatively high level, so that reflection
    of the flap to the level of the apices can be problematic.
    Therefore, a <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/surgical-endodontics/more-info">rectangular flap design</a>    with two relieving incisions is advised, and a <i>small</i>    bevel of the root face may be necessary so that the canal(s)
    can be visualised. <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">Local anaesthesia</a>    can also be surprisingly difficult, possibly due to sensory
    innervation by the nerve to mylohyoid.</p>
<p>The mental nerve usually emerges from the mental foramen below
    and between the <strong>lower premolar teeth</strong>. Therefore,
    vertical relieving incisions should be avoided in this area.
    Also, during root resection, it may be desirable to resect
    the root at the desired level, rather than burring it down,
    so as to reduce the risk of damage to the mental nerve. Whether
    or not apical surgery is possible on <strong>lower molars</strong>    depends upon the degree to which the corner of the mouth
    can be retracted. If adequate retraction can be obtained
    and the attachment of the buccinator muscle is sufficiently
    low, surgery may be possible. A wide flap is usually required
    to enhance access, and it is often necessary to remove a
    considerable thickness of bone to gain access to the roots.
    Care is needed to avoid damage to the inferior alveolar nerve,
    and again it is advisable to resect the root rather than
    burring it down.</p>
<h1 id="corrective-endodontic-surgery">Corrective endodontic surgery</h1>
<p>Corrective surgical endodontics includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>perforation repair;</li>
    <li>root resection;</li>
    <li>tooth resection;</li>
    <li>extraction with replantation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the basic surgical principles for <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/surgical-endodontics/more-info">‘apical surgery’</a>    can be applied here, for example regarding flap design, haemostasis,
    and root-end filling materials.</p>
<p><strong>Perforation repair</strong> becomes necessary to deal
    with root perforations caused by broken <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">endodontic instruments</a>    or damage by posts, and resorption cavities. If the prognosis
    of the tooth is acceptable, surgical access is gained to
    the site of the perforation, the area is prepared and then
    filled with, for example, <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/surgical-endodontics/more-info">mineral trioxide aggregate</a>.
    Figure 1 illustrates an example; the apparent over-bevelling
    is a consequence of this being a perforation repair and not
    a conventional apicectomy.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-rest-dentistry-surgical-endodontics-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Top: labial swelling (arrow) related
        to a post perforation at the upper right incisor (UR1);
        middle: flap raised and curettage of the surgical area
        effected, a periodontal probe was used to identify the
        defect; bottom: defect repaired with mineral trioxide
        aggregate to re-establish the correct root contour.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The objective of <strong>root resection</strong> is to remove
    an entire root or roots from a multi-rooted tooth, but without
    removal of any portion of the crown. The main indications
    are when one root is affected by advanced periodontal disease
    but the rest of the periodontium is relatively unaffected,
    or where it is impossible to carry out <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">root canal therapy</a>    in a root.</p>
<p>A suitable mucoperiosteal flap is reflected and the root is exposed
    by removing the overlying bone. The root is then resected
    from the tooth, removed, and the portion of the crown adjacent
    to the resected root re-contoured to make the site easily
    cleanable. The flap is sutured.</p>
<p>In <strong>tooth resection</strong>, the coronal tooth structure
    as well as the root is cut. The procedure is mainly performed
    on mandibular molar teeth with furcation involvement. The
    separated part of the tooth may either be removed or left
    <i>in situ</i> and restored. In the latter case, a molar
    is effectively converted into two premolar units.</p>
<p><strong>Extraction with replantation</strong> involves intentionally
    removing the tooth from its socket, carrying out the surgical
    endodontic procedure of choice (for example apical surgery,
    perforation repair) extra-orally, and replanting the tooth.
    Although not commonly performed, extraction with replantation
    is useful when access for surgery <i>in situ</i> is impossible
    and the alternative would be loss of the tooth. There is
    a risk of damage to the tooth during the extraction process,
    which may preclude the procedure. This technique has largely
    been replaced by immediate use of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">dental implants</a>.</p>
<h1 id="revision-surgery">Revision surgery</h1>
<p>The cause of failure of endodontic surgery should be identified
    before considering revision surgical endodontics, and an
    assessment should be made of the likelihood of correcting
    this. Success rates for repeat apical surgery are in the
    region of 30 to 40 %, which is much lower than for the initial
    procedure.</p>
<p>Root canals that have not been adequately sealed are the commonest
    cause of failure of both <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">conventional</a>    and surgical endodontic therapy. If surgical treatment has
    been performed in the absence of adequate cleansing and obturation
    of the root canal system, failure is to be expected. Repeat
    surgery will only be successful in these situations if the
    principles of conventional endodontic treatment are carried
    out first to ensure the best possible coronal seal. Failure
    caused by an inadequate apical seal can be rectified by ensuring
    there is no contamination of the root end cavity at the time
    of surgery, and by using an appropriate root end filling
    material.</p>
<p>Sometimes, during apical surgery root canals are incompletely
    sealed surgically because an additional root has not been
    identified. This should be suspected if, at the time of repeat
    surgery, the apical seal in the treated root appears intact
    and the surrounding tissues have healed. <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray/detailed">Radiographs</a>    taken at different angles can be useful in identifying additional
    roots. Often it is the deeply placed palatal root that is
    missed, particularly of upper premolar teeth. An incomplete
    seal may also be present when there are two portals of exit
    of the root canal in the same root and only one has been
    treated. Alternatively, if both canals within a single root
    have been sealed but the intervening isthmus of tissue has
    remained untreated, failure can ensue.</p>
<p>From a practical view point, revision surgery is more difficult,
    particularly when raising a flap that is scarred from previous
    surgery. The cause of the failure will determine which procedure
    is undertaken, but often the retrograde seal requires replacement.
    Care is needed when removing the old material to ensure it
    does not scatter unnecessarily in the surgical field. Depending
    on which material is used, these small fragments can cause
    staining of the mucosa or a foreign body reaction in the
    tissues. Consideration also needs to be given on whether
    the root is resected further at the time of second surgery.
    In most cases it is acceptable to reduce the root length
    a further 2 to 3 mm during revision surgery. However, in
    the presence of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal pocketing</a>,
    resection of too great a length of root will reduce the distance
    between the epithelial attachment and the root end. Therefore,
    a small amount of further periodontal breakdown and migration
    of the epithelial attachment will result in a full-length
    pocket from the gingival crevice to the apical tissues.</p>
