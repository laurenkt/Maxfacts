<h2>Third molar teeth (wisdom teeth)</h2>
<p>Surgical removal of a third molar or ‘wisdom’ tooth is one of
    the most common procedures undertaken in oral and maxillofacial
    practice. It is also a common cause for litigation. In the
    UK, even the indications for removal of third molar teeth
    excited controversy, although this has now been addressed
    by guidelines developed both by the British Association of
    Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and the National Institute
    for Clinical Excellence. The UK guidelines were reviewed
    in 2014. The German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons
    guidelines (2013) are fairly similar. Many other countries
    have devised their own guidelines and there is a lack of
    international consensus on when and when not to remove third
    molar teeth. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial
    Surgeons views are quite different from the European views.
    The safest way to remove wisdom teeth is a source of continual
    controversy, in particular how the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">lingual nerve</a>    is best protected.</p>
<p>If surgical removal of a third molar tooth is necessary, the
    surgeon needs to decide:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the path of withdrawal;</li>
    <li>obstructions to this path – do they need to be removed or
        left;</li>
    <li>the amount of bone which needs to be removed to allow application
        of an elevator (Figure 1);</li>
    <li>the direction of withdrawal (distoangular teeth are renowned
        for looking easy radiographically, but being much harder
        to remove);</li>
    <li>is the tooth best divided and removed in pieces.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>With experience, many of these points are determined intuitively
    by careful examination of the <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiograph</a>.
    Removing the third molar tooth is really removing the impediments
    and applying correctly orientated force (Figure 2).</p>

        (note the risk of driving the distal apex of the tooth
        into the inferior alveolar nerve); the open arrow indicates
        the ‘natural’ line of removal (anything which impedes
        this creates an impaction. The aim is to remove impediments
        causing impaction whilst causing least trauma. That is;
        cut up the tooth to be removed most, the surrounding
        bone as little as possible, and the adjacent teeth never).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Surgical technique for the removal of lower third molars</strong>    carries some controversial aspects. Should a lingual flap
    be raised, should burrs or chisels be used, should systemic
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial agents</a>    be prescribed (if so, when for how long), should <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroids</a>    be prescribed? Given this is such a common operation it is
    astonishing that there have not been adequately powered randomised
    controlled trials and a huge dataset for meta-analyses. For
    these, and many other points, there are no hard and fast
    rules. What seems to be emerging from the literature is that
    some techniques work well for some individuals and should
    therefore be encouraged. Only by supervised training and
    carefully conducted audit can these issues be answered and
    safe techniques developed for each surgeon.</p>
<p>The various stages in the technique are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Anaesthesia</i> – <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local anaesthesia</a>        helps <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">haemostasis</a>        and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">postoperative pain relief</a>,
        even if the surgery is carried out under a general anaesthetic.
        This involves local infiltration where the flap is to
        be raised; some surgeons will augment this with a nerve
        block even if the procedure is carried out under is a
        general anaesthetic.</li>
    <li><i>Buccal Flap</i> – a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap
        is raised from the buccal surface of the wisdom tooth
        area. The choice of incision varies, but commonly involves
        an incision along the external oblique ridge passing
        forward either around the second molar tooth or out into
        the buccal sulcus (Figure 3). If little or no bone is
        to be removed, a simple relieving incision may be all
        that is necessary. The important point is that dissection
        proceeds in a subperiosteal plane as this minimises postoperative
        swelling and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a>        (Figure 4).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The markings for a buccal flap
        in third molar removal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Buccal bone is exposed to identify
        how much needs to be removed to clear the bulbosity of
        the crown.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li><i>Lingual Flap</i> – some authorities do not raise a lingual
        flap at all. The popularity of this approach was from
        the days when accurate very high-speed surgical drills
        were not available and the ‘lingual split bone’ technique
        was popular in the UK and areas influenced by UK training.
        Their argument is that it is the process of actually
        raising the flap that causes injury to the lingual nerve.
        On the other hand, it is argued that the nerve is at
        risk from direct trauma from the burr/chisel if it is
        not retracted. Again, if used, the flap is raised by
        subperiosteal dissection. Here it is important not to
        ‘bow-string’ the nerve over the retractor (usually a
        Howarth’s elevator; Figure 1), but to widely undermine
        the lingual periosteum to allow the tissues to lie passively
        and use a wide subperiosteally placed retractor. The
        elevation of a small cuff of distal attached mucosa is
        designed for visibility, not for ‘lingual nerve protection’
        and is not associated with an increase in morbidity (Figure
        5).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Elevation of a small distal lingual
        gingival flap for visualisation; this is not the same
        as using a Howarth’s elevator for lingual nerve protection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li><i>Bone removal</i> – this is usually done with either a
        burr (Figure 6) or (rarely now) chisels. A piezoelectric
        saw has been used but much less commonly. How much bone
        needs to be removed depends on the position of the tooth.
        Care is required to ensure that enough bone remains to
        support the second molar tooth. If chisels are used,
        mesial and distal stop cuts need to be placed to prevent
        fracture propagation (Figure 7).</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Bone removal. If bone is to be
        removed the burr must penetrate into cancellous bone;
        anything less is simply traumatic scratching</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li><i>Tooth removal</i> – in less impacted cases a point of
        application may be drilled into the tooth, which is then
        elevated out of the socket (Figure 8). It is important
        not to lever the tooth out as any resistance may change
        the fulcrum of elevation and result in the inferior dental
        nerve being crushed. If the tooth does not elevate it
        may be better to divide it and remove it in pieces. This
        is where the unprotected lingual nerve may be damaged
        if the burr is passed too deeply.  </li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> The third molar is elevated at
        the safest point of application.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li><i>Coronectomy -</i> there has been a reinvention of the
        concept of decoronation for third molars which are coronally
        symptomatic (causing pericoronitis (inflammation and/or
        infection) or <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">caries</a>)
        but have significant risk of neurological damage associated
        with the operation to remove the tooth conventionally.
        In these cases, some surgeons simply remove the crown
        through the amelodentinal junction (boundary between
        enamel and underlying dentin), reduce the root surface
        to allow 2 mm of alveolar bone above the resection line
        and either close the wound or place an antiseptic pack.
        This was a popular <a href="/treatment/surgery/preprosthetic-surgery">preprosthetic technique</a>        many years ago, the retained roots preserving alveolar
        bone. The obvious risk is <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>        of the retained root at some time in the future. Clinical
        trials have suggested that coronectomy carries a lower
        risk of damage to the inferior alveolar nerve, with no
        increase in symptoms related to the retained root, which
        sometimes migrates coronally at least in short term follow
        up. Whether or not coronectomy becomes as common as conventional
        third molar removal remains to be seen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Residual follicle is removed by curettage working on the bone
    of the socket, taking care if the inferior alveolar nerve
    is exposed in the base of the socket. Bone spicules are smoothed
    and bone dust is washed from under the periosteal flap. Irrigation
    of the socket may be counterproductive if a healthy clot
    is forming. All last remnants must be irrigated out from
    under the periosteum (Figure 9).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> The socket is checked for retained
        fragments.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li><i>Closure -</i> free mucosa is sutured to fixed mucosa with
        one or two resorbable sutures only. A pressure pack is
        applied to create a <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/more-info">clot</a>.
        This is not first-intention healing in most cases; the
        flap protects the clot and allows the socket to granulate
        (Figure 10).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure10.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Closure should not be ‘watertight’
        because the socket is being protected by the flap to
        allow a healthy clot, and a small amount of oozing is
        to be expected. Overly tight closure leads to haematoma
        (see below).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The root pattern (Figure 11) and relationship to the inferior
    alveolar nerve bundle, to the adjacent second molar, and
    to bone of the ascending ramus of the mandible can all create
    problems with simple elevation of third molars. Sectioning
    the tooth is the safest technique to overcome this. The tooth
    is decoronated by cutting through the amelo-cemental junction
    (about 80% through), then the crown is fractured off with
    an elevator. If the tooth is still resistant to elevation,
    the roots are separated by cutting through the bifurcation
    and elevating them individually (Figure 12).</p>

<p><strong>Surgical technique for removal of upper third molars</strong>    involves a buccal flap. The flap is raised with an incision
    either around the second molar or a ‘slash’ passing from
    the distobuccal cusp into the buccal sulcus (Figure 13).
    Bone can often be removed buccally with a Coupland’s elevator
    (Figure 1) and the tooth then elevated with a Warwick-James
    or Cryer’s elevator. Deeply placed teeth rarely cause symptoms
    and are probably best left alone. Beware the fused, ankylosed
    or multirooted upper third molar (Figure 14).</p>

<p><strong>Complications in third molar surgery</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">pain</a>        – if anticipated this can be minimised by the regular
        use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesics</a>        for the first 3 to 4 days. This is a painful procedure,
        common humanity dictates to prescribe <i>adequate</i>        rather than over the counter analgesia. Pain is harder
        to control once it is established;</li>
    <li>swelling – <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">steroids</a>        are often given when surgery is carried out under
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthetic</a>, but this is unusual when the
            operation is carried out under local anaesthesia:</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> – some muscle
        spasm may occur during the first few days. Gentle exercises
        are required to prevent contracture. If there is still
        limitation in mouth opening at three weeks, some authorities
        elect to manipulate the mandible under a general anaesthetic;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">bleeding</a>        ;</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractured mandible</a>        (rare), fractured maxillary tuberosity (part of the posterior
        surface of the body of the upper jaw, where the superior
        alveolar nerve enters the maxilla; uncommon complication)
        (Figure 15);</li>

</figure>
<p><strong>Nerve injury</strong> is an important complication of
    mandibular third molar removal, in particular injury to the
    lingual nerve – this is a common cause of medico-legal claims.
    The lingual nerve carries sensory fibres to the tongue,
    <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste buds</a> and secretomotor fibres to the submandibular
        and sublingual salivary glands. Injury can therefore
        result in loss or distortion of sensation (including
        taste) on the affected side of the tongue and disturbed
        salivation. Most patients describe abnormal sensations,
        such as pins and needles, tingling, or itching although
        some experience <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">painful sensations (dysaesthesia)</a>.</p>
<p>The reported incidences of lingual nerve injury in the UK vary
    considerably from 0 to 15 %. Of these, most will make a full
    recovery within a few weeks, but recovery can take up to
    12 months. However, a smaller group (approximately 0.5 %)
    are left with permanent sensory disturbance. Temporary disturbance
    of the lingual nerve is often due to retracting the mucoperiosteal
    flap during surgery. Permanent injuries often result from
    nerve division during burring.</p>
<p>In selected cases, exploration of the nerve may be undertaken.
    Scar tissue is released (neurolysis) and if the nerve is
    found to be injured, the segment may be excised and the cut
    ends sutured together or grafted. Results vary considerably
    but improvements have been noted in up to 75 % of cases.
    Timing is crucial. It has been suggested that in the absence
    of any sensory recovery by three to four months following
    injury, exploration is indicated.</p>
<p>Injury to the inferior alveolar nerve is less common but harder
    to manage. The nerve may be directly injured by the needle
    during the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">injection of local anaesthetic</a>    or may be crushed by the tooth root during elevation. Rarely
    the roots of the tooth may surround and encase the nerve
    so that elevation is unavoidable. Clues to this injury can
    be seen on the radiograph and when the tooth will not elevate
    easily (it actually feels as if it is attached by a rubber
    band).</p>
<p>Increasing availability of cone beam computed tomography scans
    (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">CBCT</a>) can be useful
    in assessing lower third molars whose roots are in close
    proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve and helping to determine
    the risk of neurosensory disturbance. If such cases are identified,
    a decision may be made to remove the crown of the tooth only
    (coronectomy; see above).</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/bone-lesion/more-info"><strong>Dry socket</strong></a>    is a localised inflammation (alveolar osteitis) of a socket
    following extraction, most commonly the lower wisdom teeth.
    Typically, there is severe dull throbbing paid around 4 to
    5 days after extraction and sometimes a bad taste in mouth.
    Pain is often exquisite, with inflammation, exposed bone
    and halitosis. <a href="/treatment/surgery/bone-lesion/more-info">Treatment of dry socket</a>    includes a range of local and/or systemic interventions.</p>
<p><strong>An infected haematoma</strong> is a more significant
    problem than dry socket, mainly because the mass of a haematoma
    can rapidly liquefy and become pus, which will create a large
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">abscess</a>. Careful
    <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">haemostasis</a> prior to closing the wound can largely prevent
        this complication. If bleeding continues, the bleeding
        point needs to be identified and controlled before wound
        closure. If a large tense swelling develops after surgery,
        <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">systemic antibacterials</a>        should be started immediately (commonly amoxicillin or
        ampicillin and metronidazole; either clarithromycin or
        clindamycin for people who are allergic to penicillin).</p>
<h2>Canines</h2>
<p>If <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/ectopic-teeth/detailed">problems with impacted or ectopic canines</a>    are identified and addressed early, chances of success are
    high with relatively minor interventions. If, however, the
    problem is not identified until later in life then other
    treatment options are required, frequently involving both
    orthodontic treatment and surgery. Treatment planning needs
    to take account of general factors, including issues such
    as patient desire, expectation and co-operation (Figure 17).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure17.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 17:</strong> Fixed appliances used to align
        ectopic canines that have had gold chains attached.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Management options are protean and should be fully discussed
    with the patient and parents/carers prior to any definitive
    treatment planning decisions. Informed consent should be
    sought as what could be a routine, though complex treatment
    for a patient during their adolescence, if delayed may become
    extremely difficult later in life.</p>
<p>Management options include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>observation;</li>
    <li>surgical removal;</li>
    <li>surgical exposure and alignment;</li>
    <li>surgical repositioning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observation</strong> can be performed clinically, including
    vitality testing of adjacent teeth, and radiographically
    using a number of techniques. There are, however a number
    of potential problems that need to be considered before it
    is decided to leave the canine under observation. An ectopic
    canine can occasionally cause severe root resorption of adjacent
    teeth and this is often apparent only on <a href="/diagnosis/tests/x-ray">radiographic investigation</a>    whilst being unsuspected clinically.</p>
<p>When the deciduous (primary) canine is retained, its long term
    prognosis is uncertain. If it is lost either there will be
    an unaesthetic gap or complex <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">dental restoration</a>    will be required and that will, in all probability, have
    to be replaced at regular intervals. The deciduous upper
    canine may also suffer significant attrition by the lower
    permanent canine if retained for an extended period. This
    is concomitant with overeruption of the lower canine, potentially
    complicating any future dental restorative care due to the
    lack of vertical space in which to place a restoration.</p>
<p>In view of the potential long-term problems that can arise if
    no active treatment is undertaken, all options need to be
    discussed carefully. Patients with ectopic canines often
    have acceptable aesthetics and function, unlike patients
    with other types of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/jaw-disproportion">malocclusion</a>.
    The benefits of treatment are consequently less obvious and
    only later in life will a problem present, such as when the
    deciduous canine is lost.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical removal</strong> of an ectopic canine should
    only be carried out if it is resorbing adjacent teeth, its
    follicle has undergone cystic change, or if retention will
    prevent adoption of a comprehensive orthodontic approach.
    The decision to electively remove a permanent canine rather
    than any other tooth as part of comprehensive treatment is
    somewhat controversial. Aligning the canine is potentially
    advantageous for many reasons, including the fact that some
    clinicians believe that it is functionally important to establish
    canine guidance. In addition, because canine teeth have excellent
    longevity, it may be useful for future restorative dental
    care if required or preferred over the first premolar on
    aesthetic grounds. This view, that the canines should always
    be retained, is based on a somewhat historical perspective
    and does not take into account changes in the pattern of
    dental disease. It is now accepted that as long as there
    is a mutually protected occlusion, canine guidance as such
    is not required. Prolonged treatment to align a canine is
    difficult to justify for aesthetic reasons or for future
    restorative considerations, especially as one can now expect
    the vast majority of adults to retain the majority of their
    teeth in the long term.</p>
<p>There are risks associated with upper permanent canine removal,
    including not only those associated with a <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthetic</a>    (which is normally required), but also iatrogenic damage
    to adjacent teeth and supporting structures. These risks
    often outweigh the benefits of removal in the vast majority
    of cases.</p>
<p>The principles of surgical removal are no different from those
    described for removal of retained roots. Accurate localization
    is essential as this affects the approach to the tooth, especially
    for upper canines. The vast majority are palatally positioned
    and therefore require a palatal flap for access. After the
    flap is raised, bone may have to be removed, either with
    chisels or a burr, and the tooth localised. It can be removed
    either <i>en bloc</i> or divided and removed in pieces. Extreme
    care needs to be taken not to damage adjacent roots. Occasionally
    the ‘broken instrument technique’ can be applied, passing
    the elevator through the buccal cortex or the nasal floor.</p>
<p>For satisfactory results to be achieved by <strong>surgical exposure and alignment</strong>    of ectopic canines, complex fixed-appliances treatment for
    sometimes in excess of two years is required. Such appliances
    may include the need for dual-arch fixed appliances to allow
    for the use of interarch elastics and to allow arch co-ordination.</p>
<p>Before surgery is undertaken a decision has to be made between
    open or closed eruption. The aim of any exposure is to uncover
    enough of the crown either to place an attachment or prevent
    recovering of the crown during the healing phase. The most
    important principle of surgery is to ensure the tooth will
    erupt through keratinized mucosa. If this does not happen,
    which can occur with buccally placed canines, then the post-treatment
    <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal">periodontal condition</a>    will be compromised. This can obviously affect gingival aesthetics
    and health.</p>
<p><i>Closed eruption</i> uses an attachment secured to the tooth
    to apply orthodontic traction and is useful in the treatment
    of markedly ectopic teeth where it would be difficult to
    undertake an adequate open exposure. It is often used when
    the canine is palatally positioned. It can be used for the
    treatment of buccal canines but the results can be disappointing
    if the attachment herniates through the thin buccal gingivae.
    To avoid this, the attachment should be placed either on
    the tip of the tooth or palatally. This is sometimes not
    possible because the crown position increases the risk of
    either excessive bone removal or iatrogenic damage to adjacent
    structures. It is, however, useful in the treatment of buccal
    canines if the crown overlies an adjacent tooth and it would
    be difficult to undertake an apically repositioned flap.</p>
<p>Surgery involves the same access as for the removal of the tooth,
    except that great care must be taken not to damage the cementum
    of the root surface as this can lead to ankylosis of the
    tooth and subsequent failure of eruption. An adequate amount
    of the crown should be exposed to allow attachment of the
    bracket and chain. Prior to bonding the bracket to the tooth,
    the area should be as uncontaminated as possible. Bleeding
    should be arrested as much as practicable with the use of
    local application of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/vasopressor">vasoconstrictors</a>    (as is added to some <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">local anaesthetics</a>)
    or the use of <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">diathermy</a>.
    Once the area is prepared, the tooth surface should be washed
    with saline or water and then prepared for bonding either
    with acid etch or with self-etch priming agents. The latter
    offer the advantage that they do not need to be rinsed off,
    need less time to prepare the tooth and are to some extent
    hydrophilic.</p>
<p>Once the tooth surface has been prepared the bracket can be secured
    either with chemical- or light-cured composite. The bracket
    should be tested to ensure that it is securely in place prior
    to wound closure. The chain or ligature can either exit through
    the wound margin on the alveolar ridge or through a stab
    incision elsewhere if it is felt that this would give a better
    vector of traction to align the tooth. With teeth that are
    significantly ectopic or are close to the roots of adjacent
    teeth, it is sometimes useful for the orthodontist to be
    present at the time of surgery. This allows an assessment
    of the relationship of the canine to adjacent structures
    and to plan the vector of traction that will be most appropriate.</p>
<p><i>Open eruption</i> is often the treatment of choice for both
    buccally and palatally ectopic teeth.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Buccally placed canines - the most important principle here
        is to ensure that the tooth erupts through keratinized
        gingivae and this means that care has to be taken with
        flap design.This can effectively be achieved if an apically
        repositioned flap technique is utilised. A flap is raised
        either from the keratinized gingivae of the alveolar
        ridge if the area the tooth is to erupt into is edentulous,
        or from the gingival cuff of the deciduous predecessor
        which should be extracted at the same time as the surgery
        is undertaken. The design and direction of the relieving
        incisions allows the tooth to be exposed and the flap
        to be sutured into position, exposing an adequate amount
        of the crown of the canine (Figure 18).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure18.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 18:</strong> Top: incision for apically repositioned
        flap for upper left canine (UL3); bottom: apically repositioned
        flap complete.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
    <li>Palatally placed canines - open eruption can also be used
        in the treatment of palatally ectopic canines, especially
        when they are relatively superficial. As the palatal
        mucosa is all keratinized, the problem of ensuring that
        the tooth erupts through here is to ensure adequate crown
        is exposed to ensure that there is no chance of the crown
        becoming recovered during the healing phase. If necessary,
        a bracket can be attached at the time of surgery in the
        same manner as for closed eruption. Care must be taken
        to ensure that the cementum is not damaged during surgery
        and that keratinized mucosa is left overlying the cementum
        - enamel junction. Interestingly even if large areas
        of bone are left denuded after surgery healing is usually
        excellent and uneventful. Packs can be placed over the
        exposed tooth to aid <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">haemostasis</a>,
        comfort and to prevent the tooth becoming covered again.
        This has historically involved the placing of ribbon
        gauze soaked in varnish and secured in place with mattress
        type sutures. Periodontal dressing can also be used.
        The pack should be removed after 7 to 14 days, from when
        on <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">vigorous oral hygiene measures</a>        are vital to encourage healing, prevent gingival overgrowth
        and encourage eruption (Figure 19 and Figure 20).</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p><strong>Surgical repositioning</strong> is an alternative in
    some (rare) cases when fixed-appliance therapy is not acceptable.
    The most common indication would be for somebody who is unwilling
    to accept fixed-appliance therapy, has sufficient space for
    the tooth to be repositioned, and where it is felt possible
    to temporarily remove the tooth surgically without damaging
    it or adjacent teeth. This procedure is synonymous with tooth
    transplantation (see below). If space needs to be created
    for the tooth prior to implantation, then it can be ‘parked’
    by placing it underneath the mucosa in the buccal sulcus
    until it is required. This maintains the vitality of the
    cells of the cementum and periodontal ligament.</p>
<h1 id="supernumerary-teeth">Supernumerary teeth</h1>
<p>Surgery is usually best undertaken under a <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthetic</a>    as treatment is often on relatively young patients and good
    access is required. If an unerupted incisor is relatively
    superficial, then an open eruption technique should be used.
    If the tooth is deep, then a closed eruption technique is
    probably better. In the past, some have advocated simple
    removal of the supernumerary teeth alone to allow eruption
    of the incisor teeth. Others have advocated concurrent bonding
    of an attachment in case orthodontic traction is subsequently
    required.</p>
<p>There is evidence that a significant proportion of incisors subsequently
    fail to erupt and there is then need for re-operation if
    supernumerary tooth removal alone has been undertaken in
    order to bond an attachment to allow orthodontic traction.
    Therefore, a decision to undertake supernumerary tooth removal
    alone may mean a further operation and for some placing an
    attachment has become the ‘default’ position. This decision
    will be influenced by how ectopic the incisor is, the age
    of the patient, the relative stage of root development and
    the space available. If it is felt that there is a possibility
    that the tooth will not erupt, then it is appropriate to
    attach a bracket to the tooth/teeth to allow orthodontic
    traction at a later date if there is no evidence of subsequent
    spontaneous eruption.</p>
<p>A bracket and gold chain is usually the attachment of choice
    and this allows orthodontic traction to be placed on the
    tooth, either using a sectional fixed appliance or removable
    appliance.</p>
<h2>Surgery</h2>
<p>A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap is raised palatally. If
    possible, the nasopalatine structures should be preserved,
    although there are few reported adverse consequences if for
    reasons of access they need to be transected. These structures
    have a tendency to bleed. The primary teeth and any overlying
    bone should be carefully removed in order to expose the supernumerary
    tooth/teeth. Only enough bone should be removed to adequately
    expose the tooth as excessive bone removal has no advantage
    and may lead to poor periodontal support. Care should be
    taken not to involve the exposed tooth below the cemento-enamel
    junction as damage to this structure can lead to ankylosis.
    Care should also be taken not to disturb or damage adjacent
    incisors. Prior to wound closure an attachment should be
    placed if clinically necessary.</p>
<h1 id="miscellaneous-surgical-techniques">Miscellaneous surgical techniques</h1>
<p>Miscellaneous methods and surgical approaches that are of relevance
    in the context of ectopic and impacted teeth include</p>
<ul>
    <li>tooth transplantation;</li>
    <li>circumferential supracrestal fibrotomy (pericision);</li>
    <li>single-tooth osteotomy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tooth transplantation</strong> is a useful technique
    in a small number of clinical situations. For example, transplantation
    has been advocated to reposition ectopic canines, to replace
    developmentally absent teeth or to replace a tooth lost following
    trauma or pathology. In most of these scenarios there are
    other, often more appropriate treatments but in recent years
    there has been renewed interest in tooth transplantation
    to replace upper incisors lost following trauma. The most
    commonly affected are the upper anterior segment incisors,
    lost either due to root fracture, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">periapical infection</a>,
    ankyloses, or external/internal root resorption (Figure 21).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure21.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 21:</strong> Extracted upper left incisor
        (UL1) previously traumatised and suffering root fracture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Premolar transplantation to replace lost central incisors does
    not really work as they do not have adequate mesiodistal
    width for this to be a good aesthetic alternative. They can
    substitute for lateral incisors. This is an especially useful
    treatment choice if teeth are crowded and would require premolar
    extractions as part of a course of comprehensive orthodontic
    treatment anyway.</p>
<p>The technique can be used for any ectopic teeth, such as canines,
    where a decision has been made to undertake transplantation
    rather than orthodontic alignment. Teeth should be transplanted
    just prior to, or on the completion of, root formation, ideally
    when there is still an open apex. In these situations, there
    is the possibility of revascularization and possibly re-innervation
    of the transplanted tooth.</p>
<p>Preoperatively space is created orthodontically (Figure 22).
    A socket is prepared to accept the tooth using burrs with
    water irrigation to prevent the bone overheating and subsequent
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/more-info">necrosis</a>    (Figure 23). If further future eruption would be beneficial
    (for example in a growing patient) then again, care should
    be taken to prevent damage to the cementum, otherwise ankylosis
    may occur which would prevent further eruption.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 23:</strong> Top: incision for premolar transplant;
        bottom: donor site created with trephine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the tooth has been transplanted it should be splinted for
    between 7 and 14 days. This may be with a preformed splint
    cemented with a luting material or even with appropriately
    placed sutures (Figure 24). The area should not be disturbed
    during the healing phase to allow optimal healing of the
    periodontal ligament.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure24.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 24:</strong> Transplanted tooth held in place
        with mattress suture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the apex of the tooth was closed prior to transplantation
    then a <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">root filling</a>    should be placed immediately. If however the apex was open
    at transplantation then there is still the possibility of
    revascularisation of the pulpal tissue. In this situation,
    the tooth should be reviewed using the same protocol as would
    be used for an avulsed (knocked out) incisor. This involves
    the assessment of the tooth’s colour, colour when viewed
    with trans-illumination, pulpal vitality (response to electrical
    or thermal testing) and radiographic appearance. Obviously
    if there is evidence of pulpal necrosis, then the pulpal
    tissue should be extirpated and <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/endodontics">root canal therapy</a>    instigated (Figure 25). Once good healing of the periodontal
    ligament has occurred and the tooth is quiescent then appropriate
    restorative treatment can be undertaken to improve aesthetics.</p>

        lower first premolar.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The long term success of tooth transplantation appears excellent
    in experienced hands and it is definitely an option to be
    considered in certain appropriately selected cases. There
    does however need to be good multidisciplinary support from
    other specialties, such as paediatric and <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative dentistry</a>,
    in order that optimal results can be achieved (Figure 26,
    Figure 27).</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Circumferential supracrestal fibrotomy</strong> (or pericision)
    is a technique used to prevent or reduce relapse of rotated
    or severely ectopic teeth. Following orthodontic treatment
    the majority of fibres in the periodontal ligament rearrange
    within 4 to 6 months. The supracrestal fibres (collagen fibres
    of the gingiva) however do not and remain displaced in the
    long term. The exact mechanism of how these fibres cause
    relapse is poorly understood. Collagen fibres have no contractile
    properties which could explain relapse of tooth position
    towards pre-treatment position, although fibres are seen
    to be stretched following tooth movement. It may be the recovery
    of these fibres to their normal length that is responsible
    for the relapse seen.</p>
<p>Pericision involves the sectioning of these fibres in order that
    they reattach to the tooth in its new position. Unfortunately
    many studies have shown that there is not complete prevention
    of relapse and therefore other adjunctive retention techniques
    are still required if alignment is to be maintained. The
    sectioning of the fibres should be undertaken under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">local anaesthesia</a>.
    A scalpel blade is passed down the periodontal ligament to
    the alveolar crest around the whole circumference of the
    tooth (Figure 28). In the lower incisor region where the
    gingivae is thinner and more friable, if a complete pericision
    is undertaken then there is the danger of gingival recession
    labially. In these areas therefore sectioning of the interdental
    papilla alone should be undertaken. This involves passing
    of a scalpel blade directly through the interdental papillae
    to the alveolar crest.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-ectopic-teeth-level3-figure28.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 28:</strong> The incision for pericision.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Single tooth osteotomy</strong> is very occasionally
    necessary undertaken to reposition a single tooth which has,
    for whatever reason, been impossible to align orthodontically.</p>
<p>This is usually a treatment of last resort and may be due to
    ankylosis (secondary to trauma/infection/replacement/resorption)
    or primary failure of eruption. Prior to the osteotomy being
    undertaken adequate space must be available to allow correct
    tooth positioning. It also has to be realised that there
    will be no further tooth movement or development following
    surgery. So, if there is significant further growth expected,
    then there will be relative re-establishment of the problem
    after treatment.</p>
<p>A palatal flap is raised to allow mesial and distal cuts to be
    undertaken through to the buccal cortex. A superior cut is
    also made, although due to the angle of access this cut will
    not pass through to the buccal side. This cut is completed
    via a vertical incision in the buccal sulcus above the attached
    keratinised mucosa. This ensures that the keratinized mucosa
    on the buccal side is not disrupted and the blood supply
    to the osteotomised segment is maintained (Figure 29). Osteotomy
    is made simpler by <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures/detailed">piezosurgery</a>    which minimises bone removal. Once the segment has been gently
    mobilised it is possible to either, reposition it immediately
    and immobilise it using an arch wire (Figure 30), or to undertake
    gentle alignment of the segment orthodontically over a period
    of days and weeks in a manner analogous to <a href="/treatment/surgery/jaw-disproportion">distraction osteogenesis</a>.
    This second method is useful if the tooth is a significant
    distance from its desired position.</p>
