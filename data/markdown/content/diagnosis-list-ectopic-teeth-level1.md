<p>There is a delicate balance between the development of a foetus,
    growth of the various body parts and functions before and
    after birth, including the development and eruption of primary
    (baby) and permanent teeth throughout the developmental period.
    Any, even slight, disturbance of this balanced rate and timing
    of growth and development will cause imperfections in the
    development of the dentition of an individual. In fact, there
    are very few people with absolutely perfectly developed and
    aligned teeth.</p>
<p>Some more severe congenital conditions may lead to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/missing-teeth">missing teeth</a>    altogether, while various other congenital or environmental
    factors may cause one tooth or group of teeth such as third
    molars to be missing (a common condition). Some minor imperfections
    in the developmental process can cause a tooth (or teeth)
    to become impacted – the regular eruption is obstructed in
    some way and the affected tooth may not erupt at all, or
    only partially. Any tooth may become impacted but lower third
    molars (wisdom teeth) are most commonly affected. The common
    cause for impaction of a tooth is a minor mismatch in the
    timing and / or rate of the development of the tooth and
    the growth of the jaw or parts of the jaw at that stage,
    probably combined with a lack or natural loss of enamel at
    the contact points between the teeth around the arch of erupted
    teeth. This is particularly so for the last teeth to erupt
    (third molars or wisdom teeth).</p>
<p>Teeth that are in some way obstructed, rather than erupting partially
    or not erupting at all, may erupt in abnormal locations and
    / or in some misaligned fashion (ectopic teeth). Another
    disturbance may originate from supernumerary teeth if in
    the developmental process more teeth than the regular number
    are formed (hyperdontia). Supernumerary teeth may hinder
    the development and eruption of regular teeth but can simply
    lie causing no problems somewhere in the jaws.</p>
<p>Ectopic or impacted, partially erupted teeth are at risk of developing
    complications such as <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">advanced caries (tooth decay)</a>    or <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease (gum disease)</a>.</p>
<p>The theme of striking the right balance features prominently
    with the topic of impacted or ectopic teeth in general. There
    are many cases where untreated impacted or ectopic teeth
    do not cause any harm, and where orthodontic treatment (straightening
    of teeth) is not necessary. There are cases where a watch
    &amp; wait policy is best, and at the other end of the scale
    are those cases where interventions are necessary.</p>
