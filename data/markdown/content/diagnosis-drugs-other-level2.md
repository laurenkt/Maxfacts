<p>The biochemical and physiological effects of drugs are, obviously,
    independent of their legal status. For example, if a substance
    has potential to lead to addiction, it has these basic properties
    whether prescribed and used therapeutically or bought illegally
    and used recreationally. The three main categories of widely
    used drugs, other than <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/tobacco">nicotine</a>    and <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol</a>, that
    may be causing problems when faced with oral or maxillofacial
    conditions and/or surgery are i) opioids, ii) tranquilizers,
    and iii) stimulants.</p>
<h1 id="opioids">Opioids</h1>
<p>Opium extracted from poppy seeds has been used as a medicinal
    and a recreational drug for thousands of years in the Middle
    East, in ancient Egypt and Greece, in Europe. Poppies have
    long been known for their analgesic effects: the Latin name
    <i>papaver somniferum</i> means ‘sleep-bearing poppy’.</p>
<p>In the 20<sup>th</sup> century the active ingredients in poppy
    extracts (such as morphine) or cannabis (tetrahydrocannabinol,
    THC) have been chemically identified and fully characterised.
    Advances in chemical technology as well as in understanding
    the physiological properties of these compounds have made
    a host of similar synthetic compounds available.</p>
<p>Opioids all act upon the same group of receptors within the human
    central nervous system to produce their effect, the opioid
    receptors. These receptors already exist to accommodate naturally
    occurring compounds produced by our own bodies to relieve
    pain (endorphins and enkephalins). These compounds are the
    reason why athletes, such as marathon runners and rugby players,
    are unaware of pain until after their goals are achieved.
    Broken bones have been known to go unnoticed for a time thanks
    to the analgesic effects of these powerful endogenous compounds.
    With synthetic opioids interacting with the same receptors,
    it is unsurprising that their medicinal use is predominantly
    pain relief and anxiolysis/sedation. Where opioids are used
    as recreational drugs it is mostly for the ‘high’ (the anxiolytic
    and sedative effect) that usually accompanies (or even dominates)
    the pain relief effects.</p>
<p>Whether a drug is legal or illegal is of little importance for
    their biochemical functions, especially given that often
    legal and illegal opioid substances have very similar structures
    and, therefore, similar effects. Figure 1 shows just how
    chemically closely related some of these drugs are.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/other/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The closely related molecular
        structures of some opioids (morphine, codeine, diamorphine
        (heroin) and buprenorphine).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Codeine (see Figure 1) is a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/more-info">pro-drug</a>    that first needs to be converted to its active metabolite
    morphine by the body. Not all people can metabolise codeine
    (perhaps 80% of the population), hence in some cases codeine
    fails to have an analgesic effect. All of the opioid substances
    shown in Figure 1 (plus many more not shown in Figure 1)
    share many of the structural features of the morphine molecule.
    Given the similarities in structures, there are also similarities
    in properties. For example, diamorphine (probably better
    known as heroin) is a much more powerful analgesic (and is
    more soluble, allowing tiny quantities to be delivered) than
    morphine but, unfortunately, also has much enhanced addictive
    potential.</p>
<p>Buprenorphine is another powerful analgesic in clinical use;
    the substance has some practical advantages in that it can
    be <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">prepared and administered in many different ways</a>.
    Unfortunately as an agonist/antagonist it is only partially
    reversible by naloxone (a drug that is generally used to
    counteract the effects of opioids, especially for overdosing).</p>
<p>Another opioid very closely related to morphine is oxycodone.
    In the UK it is sometimes used as an alternative to morphine
    in palliative care: oxycodone has similar analgesic properties
    but is sometimes better tolerated with regard to poor kidney
    function and leads to less problems with drowsiness and hallucinations.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows two of the (very many) components of cannabis,
    tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, (top) and cannabidiol, CBD, (bottom).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/other/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Two active components of cannabis;
        top: THC, bottom CBD</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The two molecules have similar structures but only THC has pleasant
    (relaxing) psychoactive and/or analgesic effects. CBD is
    not psychoactive but is strongly suspected to hamper cognitive
    abilities. Natural cannabis products with enhanced THC concentrations
    (from many years of selective breeding of more potent cannabis
    plants) usually also have higher CBD concentrations. This
    may explain increasing numbers of adverse effects with the
    usage of cannabis as a recreational drug in the recent past.
    Medicinal cannabis preparations contain controlled concentrations
    of THC extracts from the plant material.</p>
<p>Figure 3 depicts the molecular structure of a very widely prescribed
    opioid, tramadol, used for the treatment of mild to medium
    pain levels. Tramadol is a less powerful analgesic than morphine
    but has similar addictive properties (partly explaining the
    recent black-market epidemic of tramadol, especially in the
    US). Tramadol is something of a peculiarity amongst medicinal
    drugs: Figure 3 depicts two geometric isomers (versions)
    of the molecule. Normally, only one particular form / isomer
    of a molecule is biochemically active. For tramadol, the
    two isomers enhance each other’s effect.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/other/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The two isomers of tramadol.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery/detailed">Fentanyl</a>    is commonly used to control chronic severe pain, often applied
    via skin patches, ensuring a steady and stable systemic concentration
    of the drug. The molecular structure of fentanyl is shown
    in Figure 4.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/other/figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The molecular structure of fentanyl.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fentanyl is a more powerful analgesic than morphine. When used
    ‘as intended’ its addictive potential is very rarely problematic
    as the pain-control effect is then by far the most noticeable
    effect. However, fentanyl used as a recreational drug is
    infamous for being involved in the untimely deaths of some
    celebrities.</p>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">Tolerance</a> to analgesic
    and euphoric effects of nearly all opioids occurs relatively
    rapidly, whereas sedative effects on the respiratory centre
    occur more slowly. Therefore, when using opioids as recreational
    drugs, an increase in dose to reach the desired ‘high’ can
    potentially lead to fatal respiratory depression. Despite
    having repeatedly mentioned the addictive power of nearly
    all opioids, if used as analgesics under medical care conditions,
    the <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/further-reading">danger of developing a dependence</a>    is much less than is often feared.</p>
<h1 id="tranquilizers">Tranquilizers</h1>
<p>Similar to opioids, tranquilizers also cause their effect through
    interactions with specific receptor sites in the brain. We
    discuss benzodiazepines as an example. They are a common
    class of tranquilizers. Benzodiazepines act upon the GABA<sub>A</sub>    receptors in the brain. This is illustrated in Figure 5.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/other/figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Interaction of benzodiazepine
        and GABA with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Normally the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors interact with the neurotransmitter
    gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA has an inhibitory effect,
    preventing nerve impulses.  Benzodiazepines fit into a different
    site on this receptor, intensifying its inhibitory action.
    Changing the chemical structure of these molecules causes
    slightly different effects as the molecule will then interact
    slightly differently with the receptor. However, the core
    of the molecules (the pharmacophore) remains the same, giving
    similar overall effects (see Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/other/figure6.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Some members of the class of benzodiazepines.
        Left: diazepam; middle: lorazepam; right: chlordiazepoxide.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Diazepam is widely used as a prescription tranquilizer (‘rose-tinted
    spectacles’). Chlordiazepoxide is the most commonly used
    drug to support <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">alcohol detoxification</a>    by reducing EtOH withdrawal effects. Lorazepam is used to
    treat anxiety disorders and to relief nausea and vomiting
    during chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines carry a high potential for dependence to form;
    this is particularly relevant given how widely this class
    of drugs has been prescribed to treat anxiety, sleep and
    convulsive disorders. <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/alcohol">Tolerance</a>    develops quickly, leading to increased doses and withdrawal
    symptoms following abstinence. As with almost all addictive
    drugs, the dopamine reward pathway is involved. Dopamine
    is released due to benzodiazepines interacting with the GABA<sub>A</sub>    receptors (see Figure 5). This positive incentive from the
    reward pathway mechanism is augmented by negative reinforcement
    that manifest as withdrawal symptoms such as irritability,
    anxiety and panic attacks.</p>
<p>Given the undesirable high potential of benzodiazepines to develop
    dependence, in the UK the so-called Z-drugs (zopiclone, zolpidem)
    are now the preferred choice of drugs to treat insomnia.
    The group of Z-drugs interact with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
    sites as so-called untypical ligands (their molecular structure
    is quite different from the benzodiazepine core structure)
    and it is believed that they are less addictive than benzodiazepines.</p>
<h1 id="stimulants">Stimulants</h1>
<p>Production of content for this website was surely helped by one
    very widely use stimulant: caffeine.</p>
<p>Between caffeine and cocaine, some may assume that cocaine is
    the more addictive of these two stimulants. In fact, cocaine
    use follows more the pattern of a strong habit-forming routine.
    This may seem a pedantic distinction but many habitually
    clean their teeth daily without getting addicted to brushing
    teeth. A strongly established habit should not be trivialised,
    however: it may be almost as hard to quit a habit as an addiction.</p>
<p>Caffeine on the other hand is known to cause physical dependence
    with withdrawal symptoms such as headaches and fatigue (there
    is a joke amongst inpatients in the UK that the quality of
    caffeinated beverages on wards is so dismal that it accelerates
    recovery of patients to enable them to find a more palatable
    solution to their caffeine cravings at home…).</p>
<p>A large class of synthetic stimulants are amphetamine and closely
    related substances. Amphetamines are powerful stimulants
    with variable degrees of dependence-forming properties. All
    amphetamines cause feelings of alertness and being energised.
    Figure 7 depicts three examples – picked from a very large
    pool of amphetamine drugs.</p>
<figure><img src="/diagnosis/drugs/other/figure7.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Some members of the class of amphetamines.
        Top: the original amphetamine molecule; middle: MDMA
        (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamide), also known as ‘ecstasy’;
        bottom: methylphenidate.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Amphetamine (Figure 7, top) is shown mostly for historical reasons
    – it represents the core structure of the whole class of
    these drugs. MDMA (‘ecstasy’) (Figure 7, middle) is a popular
    recreational drug and mainly gives effects of euphoria. Methylphenidate
    (Figure 7, bottom) is a clinically used amphetamine drug
    that is used to treat narcolepsy and hyperactivity disorders
    such as ADD (attention deficit disorder) and ADHD (attention
    deficit hyperactivity disorder) and it is debated whether
    this drug is prescribed too freely and for too long for the
    latter conditions, especially in children.</p>
<p>Similar to many recreational drugs, most stimulants achieve pleasurable
    effects through the dopamine-release reward mechanism as
    well as serotonin release.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps some extra-motivation to quit excessive drug use</strong>    when confronted with oral and maxillofacial surgery: there
    are multiple enhanced risks during and around the time of
    surgery from all three categories of drugs discussed above,
    leading to higher morbidity and increased risk of post-operative
    complications as well as higher risks from <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthetics</a>    during surgery. Some of these risks are related to various
    acute withdrawal symptoms (for example, anxiety and tendencies
    for unsocial behaviour). Continued use leads to constipation
    and increased risk of respiratory failure (opioids), as well
    as adverse interactions with other prescribed drugs (all
    of the drugs discussed above).</p>
<p>Unless you are faced with emergency surgery, there is usually
    enough time before elective (planned) surgery to engage in
    a supported round of pre-surgical detoxification. With the
    right kind of motivation and support in place, this can be
    done at home.</p>
<aside>
    <p>In the UK, many institutions and charities offer <a href="/diagnosis/drugs/further-reading">support</a>        in non-judgmental ways with the management of addictions
        as well as offering help with attempts to terminate substance
        abuse – <strong>including support for cessation of drug abuse</strong>.</p>
