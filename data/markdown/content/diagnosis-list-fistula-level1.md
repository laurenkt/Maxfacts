<p>A fistula is a communication, an abnormal connection between
    hollow organs or the body surface. This ‘pipe’ is lined by
    epithelial cells, like other inner or outer body surfaces.
    A fistula can occur in every part of the body, the most common
    locations are the intestines (in particular the bowel), blood
    vessels, the urogenital tract and the head and neck region.
    A fistula with only one open end is called a sinus tract.
    Figure 1 schematically illustrates a fistula connecting the
    oral and nasal cavities.</p>

<p>A fistula is usually a sign of some underlying <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation">inflammatory condition</a>,
    resulting from injury, infection or surgical intervention.
    The formation of a fistula may be seen as an attempt of the
    body to eradicate an inflammatory process <i>via</i> the
    skin or the mucosa (lining of the mouth, for example) by
    creating a drain for pus. Some fistulas can turn into chronic
    conditions that may persist for years.</p>
<p>The most common cause for a fistula in the maxillofacial region
    is a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/abscess">dental abscess</a>,
    with opening to the mucosa on the inside of the mouth depending
    on the position of the tooth root. It can rarely open onto
    the skin (usually from lower front teeth, or a front tooth,
    onto the chin and may be subjected to multiple ineffective
    operations by surgeons not aware of the cause). Other common
    types of fistula are connections between oral and nasal cavity,
    or connections between the maxillary sinus (hollow space
    above the upper jaw) and the oral cavity (see Figure 2; this
    latter type of fistula is a possible complication of tooth
    extractions in the upper jaw). A <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cleft-lip-palate">cleft palate</a>    may be considered a particular type of fistula.</p>

<p>As far as <a href="/treatment/surgery/fistula">treatment of a fistula</a>    itself is concerned, this will obviously depend on location
    and size of the lesion but in essence is a supportive action
    in the treatment of the underlying condition – an attempt
    to treat a fistula without addressing the cause makes little
    sense.</p>
