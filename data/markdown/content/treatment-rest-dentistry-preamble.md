<p>We state repeatedly on various pages that this website
    does not deal with (routine) dentistry; this statement
    holds true. However, there are a number of maxillofacial
    conditions and treatment modalities, such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">head &amp;
        neck malignancies</a> or serious <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a>
    where specialist considerations apply either for
    patients with specific conditions or situations who need
    comparatively conventional dental input which would be
    impossible without specialist (usually hospital based)
    provision, or where the techniques are beyond that
    applicable to general dental practice. There is also the
    consideration of restorative dentistry in children with
    major maxillofacial conditions or undergoing
    maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>This section on restorative dentistry discusses dental
    precautionary and preserving interventions, <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral
        hygiene</a> and dental restoration in the context of
    underlying maxillofacial conditions and the treatment of
    these conditions.</p>
