<p>Postoperative problems affecting the back can be remedied as
    follows</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars. Standard scar care and wound management apply. Formal
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/damage/more-info">scar revision</a>        with or without tissue expansion may be used rarely.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/shoulder">Shoulder function</a>.
        <a href="/help-selfhelp-physio-video-shoulder">Shoulder physiotherapy</a>        is the mainstay.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>        is rarely noticed as a problem. Counter-irritation techniques
        can help.</li>
</ul>
