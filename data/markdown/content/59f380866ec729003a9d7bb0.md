<p>When we resorted to allocating the body part involved and breaking
    that down into <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems">problems that may affect that body part after an intervention</a>,
    we created a logical way to approach what methods, techniques,
    approaches or tricks can be used to improve or remedy these
    problems.</p>
<p>What will appear in this section is a description of things that
    can be done to improve the situation when postoperative problems
    happen.</p>
<p>We will try to resist discussing anything which has no evidence
    of therapeutic benefit whether or not it has loud proponents
    on social media.</p>
