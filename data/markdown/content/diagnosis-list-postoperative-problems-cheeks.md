<p>Postoperative problems affecting the cheeks include</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars. Most <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">facial surgical scars</a>        are designed to lie in natural skin folds or resting
        skin tension lines, which allows them to be very effectively
        hidden.</li>
    <li>Large areas of skin loss and replacement can have a variable
        colour match and all scars take time to settle in both
        colour and prominence. Hypo- and hyperpigmentation of
        <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">skin grafts</a>        and/or scars can occur.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies">Altered sensation</a>        if underlying nerves (infraorbital, zygomatico-facial
        and zygomatico-temporal branches of the trigeminal nerve
        (one of the cranial nerves)) are damaged.</li>
    <li>Buccal mucosa (the inside surface of the cheek). This loose
        tissue is commonly bitten whether it has suffered altered
        sensation or not. If swollen postoperatively, it is more
        likely to be bitten and there is virtually nothing useful
        to prevent this. In very rare cases (such as syndromes
        in patients who have no sensation of pain) mouth guards
        made of silicone have been used. The biggest problem
        arises if the parotid duct (the connection of the parotid
        salivary gland to the oral cavity) is damaged or obstructed
        by the process.</li>
