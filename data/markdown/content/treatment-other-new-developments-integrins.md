<p>Integrins are a family of proteins that form a component
    of cell walls and generally fulfil a diverse range of
    roles in the cellular biochemistry and metabolism. We
    discuss this group of proteins because of their
    potential for real-time assessment of surgical margins
    in <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer">maxillofacial
        oncological surgery</a>, a particularly important
    aspect of head and neck surgery. We give a brief
    overview of structure and function of integrins, how
    they interact with / bind to other molecules, and how
    their specific properties can be used to visually
    distinguish malignant cells from healthy tissue. We
    conclude by comparing the potential of integrins for the
    assessment of surgical margins with current methods
    (mostly a special kind of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">biopsy</a>, a
    frozen section) and some other currently explored
    techniques, such as <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/raman-spectroscopy">Raman
        spectroscopy</a> or <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/mass-spectrometry">mass
        spectrometry</a>.</p>
<h1 id="structure-and-function-of-integrins">Structure and function of integrins</h1>
<p>Integrins are a family of proteins located in the outer
    surface of cells, the cell membrane. They belong to a
    category of proteins known as transmembrane proteins.
    They play an important role in connecting cells to each
    other and to the region surrounding cells, the
    extracellular matrix. There are different types of
    integrins, with slightly different structures and,
    therefore, slightly different properties. The general
    structure of integrins is shown in Figure 1.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A schematic view
        of the general structure of integrins.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Generally, integrins consist of one alpha (<i>α</i>)
    subunit, and one beta (<i>β</i>) subunit. With these two
    different subunits, integrins are referred to as a
    heterodimer. Humans have 18 different <i>α</i> subunits,
    and 8 different <i>β</i> subunits, which together can
    form at least 24 different heterodimers. Each of these
    integrins has a distinct structure and function,
    including the ability to bind to different components
    (ligands) of the extracellular matrix. One particular
    feature of ligand - integrin binding is a common motif
    of three particular amino acids (arginine, glycine,
    aspartic acid; the ‘RGD sequence’), which is located on
    many ligands. Some integrins can bind to multiple
    ligands, and some ligands can bind to multiple
    integrins.</p>
<p>Integrins are involved in cell - cell and intra-cell -
    extracellular matrix binding. Integrins not only help
    join the cell and its extracellular space physically,
    but also play an important role in communication between
    them, through signalling in both directions (Figure 2
    and Figure 3).</p>

<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-integrins-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A schematic view
        of the ‘inside-out’ signalling role of integrins
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>‘Outside-in’ signalling is the term used to describe
    signals starting from the extracellular matrix, whereas
    ‘inside-out’ signalling is when signals start from the
    inside of the cell. In each case, binding of a ligand to
    one end of the integrin causes a change in the overall
    shape of the integrin, in this way passing on a message
    to the other side of the cell membrane. In the case of
    outside-in signalling, this can impact on important
    processes such as cell proliferation (the rate at which
    cells divide), cell survival, and cell movement. The
    survival of many types of cells is reliant on binding to
    the extracellular matrix, so integrins are important in
    preventing programmed cell death known as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft/more-info">apoptosis</a>,
    a part of the regular renewal processes of a living
    organism.</p>
<h1 id="integrins-in-healthy-and-in-malignant-cells">Integrins in healthy and in malignant cells</h1>
<p>Integrins are thought to be involved in many conditions,
    including malignancies, some <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">viral
        infections</a> (such as the Epstein-Barr virus), and
    some <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/detailed">autoimmune
        diseases</a> (such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/salivary-gland-problems/detailed">Sjögren’s
        syndrome</a>). The specific type of integrins
    involved in diseases are often found at elevated levels
    in damaged cells and tissue. For example, certain
    integrins involved in malignancies are found in much
    higher levels in tumour cells than in surrounding
    healthy cells. Thus, in principle, specific integrins
    may offer a means to distinguish malignant cells from
    healthy tissues. In particular, the integrin
    <i>α</i>v<i>β</i>6 has been identified to be present at
    high concentrations in the invasive front of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer/detailed">malignant
        oral tumours</a> (squamous cell carcinoma, the most
    common oral malignancy) but is only present at very low
    levels in normal adult cells in healthy tissue. The
    human eye cannot see individual cells or protein
    molecules, so some form of visual marking of the high
    concentration of the diagnostic integrin is needed
    (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-integrins-figure4.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Left: labelling a
        specific integrin in a healthy cell with a
        particular small peptide with specific binding
        properties and carrying a fluorescent marker fails;
        right: in contrast, a particular small peptide with
        specific binding properties and carrying a
        fluorescent marker binds to a specific integrin in a
        malignant cell and labels the cell.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The way to achieve visualisation of the diagnostically
    relevant integrin is by binding a specific (small)
    peptide to it. As it is known that integrin
    <i>α</i>v<i>β</i>6 binds to RGD peptide sequences (see
    above), small peptides containing this sequence and
    binding solely to integrin <i>α</i>v<i>β</i>6 have been
    identified; attaching a <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">fluorescent
        label</a> to the marker peptide then makes malignant
    cells visible when inspected with the appropriate light
    and/or fluorescence microscope. In a nutshell, this
    process effectively paints malignant cells in a
    different colour to healthy tissue.</p>
<p>The ability to label malignant cells and easily
    distinguish them from healthy tissue has an obvious
    application as a tool to assess surgical margins in the
    operating theatre (see below). Such a ‘designer peptide’
    which solely binds the specific integrin enriched in a
    particular tumour could also be used to guide toxic
    substances to malignant cells, whilst sparing healthy
    cells from exposure. Similarly, such integrin – ligand
    interactions could be used to interfere with malignant
    cells more directly, affecting their movement (relevant
    in the development of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases/more-info">metastases</a>),
    their proliferation and their signalling, and possibly
    inducing the selective apoptosis of malignant cells.</p>
<h1 id="integrins-in-the-evaluation-of-surgical-margins-in-maxillofacial-surgery">Integrins in the evaluation of surgical margins in
    maxillofacial surgery</h1>
<p>Current methods to assess surgical head &amp; neck tumour
    margins include taking <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">frozen
        sections of tissue</a>, or the assessment of
    cytological samples where hard tissue needs to be
    evaluated. These forms of biopsies rely on speedy access
    to / action of the pathology laboratory and are known to
    suffer from some inaccuracies. The human eye and tactile
    information, in conjunction with imaging results (<a href="/diagnosis/tests/ct-scans">CT</a> and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">MRI</a>) obtained
    before surgery are the remaining tools.</p>
<p>Achieving a clear margin in oncological surgery is not
    just important in maxillofacial surgery but is highly
    relevant for all areas of tumour surgery. It is highly
    important to have such margin information available
    intraoperatively, rather than having to wait for regular
    histology / pathology results (which may take several
    days). Accordingly, many efforts are underway to find,
    test and establish new ways to assess surgical margins
    in the theatre. For example, breast surgery may benefit
    from using <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/mass-spectrometry">mass
        spectrometry</a> for this purpose, and <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/raman-spectroscopy">Raman
        spectroscopy</a> is also explored as a new real-time
    in-theatre assessment technique. Both methods hold
    promise (and are being explored for applications in
    maxillofacial surgery), but both methods depend
    critically on the availability of suitable data bases
    for comparison with a ‘fingerprint’ of the actual
    specimen. One may thus assume that these two methods
    will be most successful for tumour surgery where there
    is little tissue heterogeneity (little variation of
    tumour cell types) between cases and a meaningful data
    base for comparison can be assembled in a
    straightforward manner. Unfortunately, this is not the
    case for head &amp; neck malignancies which represent a
    diverse and heterogenous group of malignant tumours. In
    addition, in the head and neck region the requirement
    for evaluation of surgical margins is particularly
    challenging as often complex defects are created, and
    there is a delicate balance between achieving a clear
    enough margin without harming vital functionalities or
    without unnecessarily causing other functional
    impairments.</p>
<p>The potential of integrins for evaluation of surgical
    margins in head and neck malignancies has been
    demonstrated clinically for the integrin
    <i>α</i>v<i>β</i>6, including the evaluation of bony
    margins. The method remains to be fully evaluated. There
    is a clear potential advantage to the integrin approach
    for head and neck malignancies over other currently
    explored technologies: the method does not depend on
    comparisons with a database, it directly addresses the
    case at hand and thus is well placed to deal with
    heterogenous groups of tumours.</p>
