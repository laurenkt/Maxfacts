<p>Diagnosis is finding out about the causes of your problems and/or
    condition. This is usually done by excluding some possibilities,
    testing some others and finally arriving at a diagnosis.
    This is, in some sense, the first step toward solving the
    problem, or at least reducing it as much as possible.</p>
<p>A confirmed <a href="/diagnosis/a-z">diagnosis</a> is the basis
    for rational <a href="/treatment">treatment</a> planning
    and for making the best possible decision for choosing treatment
    options that are best for your situation and priorities.
    The process of arriving at a confirmed diagnosis, in addition
    to a thorough medical examination and exploration of your
    medical history, usually includes the use of a range of
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests">diagnostic methods and procedures</a>. Exactly what is required
        in this process depends on the initial suspected conditions
        and on the findings of initial tests.</p>
<p>Some diagnostic tests and procedures not only confirm (or exclude)
    a diagnosis, they also contribute toward treatment planning.
    Depending on your diagnosis and the time scale of planned
    interventions and actions, this is the time when you can
    begin to help yourself by considering your use of <a href="/diagnosis/drugs">recreational and other drugs</a>:
    you may consider giving up smoking and/or drinking or the
    use of other non-prescription drugs. Taking such steps can
    make a very positive contribution toward optimal treatment
    outcomes.</p>
