<p>Mupirocin is an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">antibacterial agent</a>    which is effective in treating <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">skin infections</a>    by a (small) range of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">aerobic bacteria</a>.
    Mupirocin is used as a <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">topical treatment</a>    in the form of creams or ointments. It is also used to eliminate
    asymptomatic methicillin-resistant <i>staphylococcus aureus</i>    (MRSA) infections in the nose (for example, ahead of maxillofacial
    surgery), but there are increasing problems with resistant
    strains of <i>s. aureus</i>. Because of increasing resistance,
    mupirocin is not considered to be a suitable agent for long-term
    antibacterial treatment. Mupirocin has further been used
    as a ‘disinfectant’ ahead of minor skin surgery, such as
    the excision of small <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/facial-skin">basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesions</a>.</p>
<p>Mupirocin has been known for approximately 50 years. It is isolated
    from some <i>pseudomonas</i> strains and, in common with
    other antibacterial agents isolated from bacteria, there
    are groups of bacteria that are naturally resistant to it.
    Mupirocin is a mixture of several derivatives of pseudomonic
    acid (Figure 1). The <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">mechanism of antibacterial activity</a>    of mupirocin is based predominantly on its interference with
    the bacterial cell metabolism (RNA), hindering bacterial
    protein synthesis.</p>
