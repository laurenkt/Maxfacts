<p>The <a href="/diagnosis/a-z">range of oral and maxillofacial conditions</a>    is wide and varied, the resulting range of difficulties encountered
    with oral food &amp; drink intake is equally wide and varied.
    However, eating and drinking is important for everybody,
    way beyond the mere necessities of providing nutrition for
    the body. An old German proverb reflects this: ‘Essen und
    trinken hält Leib und Seele zusammen‘ (eating and drinking
    keeps body and soul together).</p>
<p>There will be times and circumstances where oral food intake
    is not possible and <a href="/help/non-oral-food">alternative feeding methods</a>    have to be used but fortunately, despite sometimes serious
    and long-term difficulties, almost everybody will be able
    to enjoy food and drink in some shape or form. The possibilities
    to adapt food and drink to accommodate various needs are
    endless (but more serious in-depth research into such matters
    would also be useful).</p>
<p>Other pages in this section are dedicated <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">to taste, texture and temperature of food</a>,
    a <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes/browse">collection of recipes</a>    and <a href="/help/oral-food/cooking-videos">cooking video demonstrations</a>,
    <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubrication of foods</a>,
    <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">the role of saliva in eating</a>,
    the <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">normal process of swallowing</a>,
    some general patterns for <a href="/help/oral-food/texture-adaption">adapting food textures</a>    and some considerations of <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">nutritional needs</a>.</p>
<p>Below we share a colourful mix of practical tips and considerations,
    many discovered (and tested) by the experts by experience
    – patients and carers. The collection is of the ‘pick &amp;
    mix’ variety: choose and try what you feel is most useful
    for your situation. What works best is individually very
    different and will probably change over time, but there are
    some general trends. One general fact certainly is that maintaining
    the best possible <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    greatly helps to support and enjoy eating. For example, if
    you only eat very soft or liquid meals your tongue will not
    self-clean as it normally would by processing hard foods
    and this will reduce your <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste acuity</a>    (unless you take appropriate oral-hygiene action).</p>
<p>It may seem counterintuitive to have such a collection of practical
    tips around eating and drinking, and a cookbook and recipes
    for times when eating is difficult. It makes sense because
    preparing your own food (or even better: having somebody
    help you with it) gives you by far the best options to get
    your food exactly right for your needs and appetite, no matter
    how unconventional that may be at the time. Keep on trying
    to eat (unless you have been advised by your medical team
    not to take oral food for the time being), even if it is
    difficult and you can only manage small amounts at a time.
    It will help you greatly to return to some form of new normal
    and to more normal eating patterns later on. It will also
    help you to retain (or regain) your sense of taste and /
    or the mechanics of swallowing – by keeping it all in use
    and in ‘training’ (the body is a very efficient machinery
    – whatever doesn’t get used will be reduced or shut down).</p>

<h1 id="in-the-kitchen-/-pantry">In the kitchen / pantry</h1>
<p>Nothing unusual is needed as far as kitchen gadgets are concerned:
    a reasonably powerful blender or food processor and a couple
    of fine-meshed sieves is all that is needed. What qualifies
    as a sufficiently fine-meshed sieve, again varies (see Figure
    1): for most people a typical standard sieve as available
    from supermarkets will be adequate (Figure 1 right) to achieve
    a sufficiently smooth consistency of foods. If the slightest
    little ‘bit’ in your food bothers you, you will need to get
    a more finely meshed sieve from a more specialised kitchen
    shop or online supplier (Figure 1 left).</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-practical-tips-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Fine-meshed sieves; right: standard
        version (available in many sizes), left: a finer mesh
        (also available in many sizes).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clever combined use of fridge, freezer and microwave is useful
    to have an appetising selection of foods (almost) ready at
    all times. As soon as you start preparing food from scratch,
    there will always be some surplus - keep it and freeze it.
    Smooth purees are a great space-saving, freezable starting
    material for many different preparations, from liquid foods
    to jellies or purees. It will only take a few days of cooking
    from scratch and you will have a nice selection of nearly-ready
    meals in your freezer.</p>
<p>Fine oat meal and all kinds of tinned or frozen pulses (including
    chick peas, peas, butter and other beans, split red and yellow
    lentils) are convenient versatile cupboard bases for satisfying
    liquid and soft / smooth meals that keep the hunger away
    for a while (and are good sources of proteins too). Make
    sure that foods based on pulses are carefully pureed and
    the puree / liquid is passed through a fine-meshed sieve
    before serving. Because of their high content of purines,
    lentils as a major diet component can be problematic for
    people suffering from gout.</p>
<p>A visit to the baby-food aisle in your local supermarket may
    be a worthwhile excursion: if ordinary fruit juices or fruit
    purees are too acidic for you, try pear or apple juice or
    fruit purees for babies. These products are much less acidic
    and may just work for you. Generally, if fruit purees are
    too acidic, try mixing them with some Greek yogurt or whipped
    or double cream. That might be enough to remove the sharp
    edge (adding loads of sugar does <i>not</i> work). In order
    to boost your protein intake, you can mix / smuggle baby
    meals (chicken, for example) into smooth vegetable soups
    when heating your soup. Baby meals are best ‘hidden’ in other
    foods, their distinct lack of taste is not particularly attractive
    to most adults. Instant baby porridge could be a lazy breakfast
    option; it is perfectly smooth and designed to be easy to
    swallow (because babies need to <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">learn to swallow safely</a>,
    and you may feel young at heart…) but be aware that (sadly)
    these preparations tend to have a high sugar content.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid hidden sugar in your meals, do not use low-fat
    products (these all have added sugar, sometimes large amounts)
    and stay away from ready meals. Some preservatives in processed
    foods also can be difficult if you have problems with acidic
    foods. Many food preservatives are, chemically speaking,
    acids.</p>
<p>The two most familiar household ingredients for modifying the
    consistency and texture of foods are probably corn flour
    and gelatin (so called vegetarian gelatin is also available).
    These two <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt/texture-modifiers">texture modifying agents</a>    have different roles in the optimisation of food preparations.</p>
<p>If your meals are mainly based on liquids you may find that ever
    so slightly thickening the liquids can make eating easier,
    or your meal may feel more satisfying in that way. That needs
    a little bit of experimentation and corn flour or arrow root
    (mixed with a little bit of water, added to the gently boiling
    liquid food) may be the perfect thickener to adjust the thickness
    precisely as you want it. You need to try if this gives your
    liquid food a texture that is comfortable to eat at the most
    suitable temperature. In addition, corn flour or arrow root
    are useful for thickening the liquid component of mixed-texture
    foods to achieve a more homogenous consistency that is easier
    and safer for some to swallow (for example, fruit compotes).
    Please note that corn flour and arrow root are not suitable
    as thickeners when you suffer from dry mouth (see below).</p>
<p>The role of gelatin is slightly different. With the help of gelatin
    you can turn all liquids or thin purees into slippery jellies
    (sweet as well as savoury) which are particularly easy to
    eat. Sometimes a (cold) jelly can be easier to eat than the
    corresponding (warm) liquid, sometimes it may be the other
    way around. The gelatin slippery approach works well for
    liquefied fruit and vegetable purees, pureed meats, broth
    and juices which can all be turned into jellies. Jellies
    are very useful to maintain good levels of hydration if swallowing
    liquids is problematic – jellies are liquids in disguise.
    Again, it is all about your personal preferences but varying
    the thickness and degree of ‘slipperiness’ of your jellies
    will give you quite a diverse range of food textures; useful
    to battle any onset of food boredom.</p>
<p>Ordinary gelatin (which is made from animal collagen) has a special
    role in dysphagia (see below) diets: jellies made with ordinary
    gelatin are particularly slippery and easy to swallow because
    their melting point is close to body temperature. Vegetarian
    gelling agents produce more brittle, less slippery jellies
    (and mousses) with higher melting points and a different
    mouth feel. The otherwise extremely useful properties of
    jellies made with ordinary gelatin explain the following
    words of caution. If it takes you a considerable amount of
    time to get ready to swallow a portion of jelly, be aware
    that i) over the period of time the jelly may melt in your
    mouth and you may have liquid in your mouth, and ii) if you
    have normal saliva production, over time one of the <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">enzymes in saliva</a>,
    amylase, may break down parts of the jelly and again you
    may have liquid in your mouth( there are amylase-resistant
    thickeners available, if necessary).</p>
<p>Before we start with cooking: the good news is that there are
    really no restrictions as to flavours – almost everything
    and anything can be prepared in liquid, smooth or soft form
    at different temperatures. The only compromise is texture
    and that is quite straightforward to adjust according to
    what you feel is most comfortable and it usually does not
    involve a great deal of kitchen chores. Thinking a little
    bit outside the box and being imaginative and adventurous
    certainly helps.</p>
<h1 id="at-the-dinner-table">At the dinner table</h1>
<h2>Serving food</h2>
<p>Serve your food in small(ish) portions on/in small(ish) dishes
    – much less daunting when eating is hard work. Try to eat
    often and in small portions if you find eating is hard work.
    It helps if your food looks pretty and is nicely presented.
    Some / most people prefer social eating / company at the
    dinner table. Some prefer eating on their own, for example
    when conversation over dinner would be a distraction from
    paying attention to special swallowing manoeuvres. Please
    do NOT avoid company for dinner just because you think that
    your current table manners aren’t up to scratch. It doesn’t
    matter.</p>
<h2>Cutlery and other tools</h2>
<p>If you suffer from restricted mouth opening or have problems
    with motor control of the lip region, using cutlery, in particular
    big spoons is not exactly the easiest way to eat. Little
    flat plastic ice cream spoons work rather well if you can
    manage smooth and pureed, or other soft, foods. If you still
    prefer eating with conventional cutlery, have a look around
    for children’s cutlery with fairly flat and small spoons.
    Several people recommend using long-handled teaspoons (‘latte’
    spoons). If metal cutlery feels uncomfortable (or seems to
    taste strange), replace it by plastic cutlery. Figure 2 shows
    a selection of cutlery and similar tools.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-practical-tips-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Some potentially useful tools
        to expand the conventional cutlery range (though nothing
        much unconventional included in the selection)…</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If your fingers turn out to be the best tool for the time being,
    there is nothing wrong with that! So much about standard
    table manners and etiquette is based on local culture and
    traditions. Most of the Middle East and Asia consider our
    western ways of eating with metal cutlery as fairly barbaric,
    for example, and in these parts of the world there is a refined
    etiquette about eating with your fingers.</p>
<p>If you can manage small pieces of soft foods once they have found
    their way into your mouth, you may want to try chop sticks;
    this also avoids inconvenient mouth gymnastics.</p>
<p>For liquid food, most people find the good old mug or a cup the
    most versatile dish to handle (somehow; it tends to be easier
    if the cup or mug is thin-walled). Using a paper cup and
    squeezing its lip into a V-shaped spout can give you a more
    targeted way to deliver liquids to your mouth. Alternatively,
    a baby cup with a spout may be convenient if you have no
    problems closing your lips around it. A large syringe is
    yet another way of delivering liquids into your mouth. If
    the mechanics of swallowing liquids is a problem (in particular
    with liquids occasionally ending up in the wrong pipe, for
    example when not paying attention, or talking while eating).
    Using a drinking straw can help in some cases, at least it
    is worth a try.</p>
<h1 id="dry-mouth-xerostomia">Dry mouth, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a></h1>
<p>If you are affected by a dry mouth you may find it easiest to
    eat cold, or lukewarm, liquid or nearly liquid, and smooth
    / soft foods. Go easy with salt and sugar (see below), both
    can make eating more unpleasant.</p>
<p>Smaller than normal amounts of saliva not only make eating more
    difficult and less pleasant because of reduced taste sensation,
    the lack of protection by saliva also makes teeth much more
    vulnerable to <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a>.
    Sugar in particular should be avoided: plaque bacteria, causing
    dental decay, thrive on a sugary diet. If manageable, sugar-free
    chewing gum can be useful. Not only will the chewing motions
    encourage saliva production, but xylitol (artificial sweetener
    in many chewing gums; other than normal sugar it is not converted
    to acids in the mouth) is harmful to the metabolism of plaque
    bacteria. Avoid acidic and sugary drinks, instead consider
    tea and green tea: both brews contain fluoride ions and thus
    can contribute to dental health. Watch out for foods with
    hidden sugar (the classic example being ‘natural fat-free
    yogurt’ – naturally, yogurt <i>does</i> contain a certain
    amount of fat, and there is sugar added to all fat-free yogurts).</p>
<p>Sometimes it is recommended to people with dry-mouth problems
    to sip water all the time to keep the mouth moist. That is
    most likely not a good recommendation. The main effect that
    this will have is that any remaining, small but important
    amounts of saliva will be diluted and/or washed away. It
    is a good idea to carry a bottle of water around to have
    some drink at hand when needed. But apart from that, there
    are other tried and tested ways to reduce the drying out
    of mucosa and tongue. For some people some of the commercial
    artificial saliva products help between meals and at night.
    But most people prefer certain foods as mouth-moisturising
    agents. Favourites include regular sips of buttermilk, broth,
    lukewarm salt solutions, sage infusions, cream or mascarpone,
    or good quality (non-acidic) oils.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon that it is recommended that people with dry-mouth
    problems essentially wash their food down with large amounts
    of water. That is not a good idea! While it is obvious that
    something needs to be done to help with swallowing, it is
    equally obvious that washing each small bite of food down
    with large amounts of water is counterproductive.</p>
<p>This is because i) it will make you feel full very quickly and
    you will not eat enough in that way; ii) it makes eating
    very unpleasant because large amounts of water do not contribute
    to a consistency of the food bolus that would trigger the
    swallowing reflex and thus requires a major forced effort
    to get anything down.</p>
<p>Using plenty of <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubrication</a>    and suitable sauces of all kinds is a much better approach.
    Lubrication does not dilute your food further but will help
    to modify the consistency such that it is easier to swallow.
    One can explain well why gelatin-based jellies and custards
    are again and again reported to be very good <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">lubricating agents</a>    – both can essentially mimic certain lubricating properties
    of saliva. Apart from these two special, universal lubricants,
    it depends on the chemistry and rheology of a particular
    food what will make a suitable lubricant.</p>
<p>The range of potential lubricants ranges from 100 % water all
    the way to 100 % fat, such as in oils and melted butter.
    Somewhere between these two extremes are milk, cream, chicken
    stock, gravy, mayonnaise. Most foods are hydrocolloids, complicated
    mixtures of fat, water and other components. Accordingly,
    it is to be expected that different types of food will be
    well, or not so well, lubricated by particular types of lubricants
    where the main difference between lubricants will be their
    different characteristic water-to-fat ratios.</p>
<p>Examples of useful lubricants are rich concentrated chicken stock
    (particularly nice with vegetables; make a large quantity,
    freeze in small portions in an ice cube container and use
    as you go), double cream or whipped cream, good quality rapeseed
    or olive oil (which will also go nicely with some sweet foods;
    some may find a hint of acidity of olive oil irritating),
    other oils (walnut, pumpkin-seed or grape-seed oils are really
    nice but are a bit pricey), any variety of smooth rich gravy
    (home-made, not from granules), good quality mayonnaise (preferably
    homemade; easy, see our <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">recipes</a>),
    mascarpone (rich Italian cream cheese) thinned with single
    cream, melted butter. All kinds of sweet and savoury custards
    and jellies - see our <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">recipes</a>.</p>
<p>There is no need to worry about these supposedly guilty pleasures.
    When you find eating hard work, and/or you are on a diet
    of liquid or pureed foods these foods are by necessity diluted.
    In addition, you will probably eat a little less than you
    normally would. In these circumstances these not-so-guilty
    lubricating pleasures are very welcome because they add nutrition,
    calories and proteins, to your diet without causing extra-efforts
    with eating.</p>
<aside>
    <p>A <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication/printable-grid.pdf">printable grid, listing the whole range of potential lubricating agents can be found here</a>;
        use it to identify useful and non-working food/lubricant
        combinations.</p>
</aside>
<p>Munching on pieces of fresh pineapple, or mashed pineapple, can
    help to make sticky saliva less viscous. Humidifiers help
    to improve the humidity of the room air, especially during
    heating periods. Some people report that using the smell
    of essential oils acts like a mouth-watering appetiser when
    used before eating, improving saliva production. Careful
    and regular <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    is very important to avoid dental decay and gum inflammations.</p>
<h1 id="sore-mouth">Sore mouth</h1>
<p>If your main problem is soreness of mouth and throat, creamy
    liquid and jellied foods are easiest to handle. Avoid acidic
    foods and choose dairy-based meals with little seasoning.
    Cold (or frozen) food is likely to be easiest to handle.
    Especially if you have sores or ulcers in the mouth it is
    a good idea to avoid sugar; this helps to prevent <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">oral infections</a>.</p>
<p>If you are affected by mucous and find that dairy products aggravate
    your problem, reduce the amount of dairy component in recipes
    and increase the amount of stock or water accordingly. Rinsing
    your mouth right after eating also helps.</p>
<h1 id="difficulty-opening-mouth-trismus">Difficulty opening mouth, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a></h1>
<p>Fortunately, for many people variable levels of trismus are a
    temporary nuisance, a symptom of some acute condition or
    a temporary consequence / discomfort following some surgical
    intervention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, severe and lasting forms of trismus can be a long-term
    problem after <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    in the head and neck region, or a symptom of some other serious
    conditions. Severe forms of trismus present a challenge for
    the provision of a balanced oral diet – but equipped with
    some willingness to think outside the box and exploit whichever
    tricks there are to get tasty food into the mouth and safely
    swallowed: it can be done! It can even be done with a varied
    and interesting diet!</p>
<p>There are a few obvious starting points for a viable balanced
    diet for people suffering from severe trismus. Clearly, it
    will have to be mainly liquid foods and/or thin purees. That
    requirement in itself is not so much a restriction of foods
    (almost all foods can be pureed or liquified), the main problem
    is that liquids and thin purees are quite dilute foods and
    it may be a challenge to eat enough over the day. Therefore,
    it is helpful to use nourishing diluting liquids rather than
    water to adjust thickness of foods (anything, from cream
    or milk to non-dairy ‘milks’ to chicken or beef stock, etc).</p>
<p>It is a good idea to plan for plenty of time for eating and not
    rushing it. Over time, many trismus sufferers develop ingenious
    methods and tricks to adapt their favourite foods. Most become
    experts at slurping foods (practice makes perfect…), and
    that then may well include very soft small chunks of food
    that do not require chewing (think of tiny pasta shapes,
    for example, combined with completely smooth, no-bits versions
    of lubricating pasta sauces). It is generally recommended
    that foods should be free of ‘bits’ and the amount of sugary
    foods should be minimal because <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a>    can be a challenge too with severe levels of trismus.</p>
<h1 id="difficulty-swallowing-dysphagia">Difficulty swallowing, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a></h1>
<p>Swallowing problems are as widely varied as the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia/more-info">underlying causes</a>.
    Different conditions and problems will call for different
    solutions for optimal <a href="/help/oral-food/texture-adaption">adaption of oral food</a>;
    the <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapists</a>    help to assess and monitor the oral food intake options and
    suggest the most suitable <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">food textures</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to assess  and re-assess dysphagia problems over
    time because not all such swallowing problems have clear
    and obvious symptoms, but can lead to serious health consequences
    such as pneumonia caused by repeated aspiration of foods
    into the airway.</p>
<p>Despite the wide range of different swallowing problems, all
    calling for tailored approaches with the most suitable -
    and widely different - food preparations for different conditions,
    there are some general patterns and common aspects:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the most comfortable volume of food which is easiest to swallow,
        seems to be around 5 ml, approximately equivalent to
        a heaped teaspoon portion</li>
    <li>avoid extreme mixtures of textures and consistencies of foods
        – these are the most challenging swallowing tasks if
        you have to process, for example  a liquid and some solid
        food simultaneously (the classic example is chicken soup,
        broth with pieces of meat and vegetables). No need to
        despair if you really have an appetite for chicken soup
        – just separate the components and do not mix them in
        your mouth but eat them separately)</li>
    <li>if you need to swallow pills regularly, trying to wash pills
        down with water is another version of the chicken-soup
        problem. Instead, try to use slightly less liquid foods
        to get the pills down. Yogurt, apple sauce or other soft
        purees all work well and are much safer to swallow together
        with a pill. You may consider wrapping your pills in
        some other slippery foods such as liver paté, or butter
        / margarine to help with swallowing (a trick well known
        to pet cat &amp; dog owners…). Please do remember that
        not all pills are suitable for crushing or grinding;
        if it is too difficult to swallow your regular medication(s)
        in the form of tablets or capsules, there may be alternative,
        more convenient <a href="/treatment/other/medication/delivery">delivery vehicles</a>        for your medication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Texture is not the only aspect that can make all the difference
    between being able to eat something comfortably, or not.
    The temperature of your food also makes a huge difference.
    Many people with a variety of swallowing problems find that
    the colder the food the easier it will be to swallow (that
    is the reason why we have a number of unusual recipes for
    frozen foods in our <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">recipe collection</a>).
    Some people find that they can happily enjoy some foods in
    the form of ice cream (including savoury foods) while the
    same food in its ordinary warm form is beyond reach or not
    nearly as enjoyable. It is a good idea to experiment a little
    with food temperatures within your comfort zone of food textures.
    You may even discover that this texture comfort zone varies
    slightly as a function of temperature.</p>
<p>Temperature contrast can also work in your favour. For example,
    if you take a sip of carrot soup at ‘normal’ soup temperature
    followed by a mouthful of basil ice cream (see our <a href="/help/oral-food/recipes">recipe collection</a>)
    and so on, the temperature contrast may well be able to contribute
    to a less cumbersome dining experience. The temperature contrast
    may enhance muscle tone and thus help with swallowing. There
    are no fixed or golden rules but a little bit of experimentation
    around the temperature of your food is definitely a good
    idea. Most foods taste good over a wide range of temperatures.</p>
<p>There are several surprisingly disappointing candidates as far
    as pureed food is concerned:</p>
<ul>
    <li>long-grain rice fails miserably, it stubbornly retains a
        sharp crumbly consistency. Short-grain rice when well-cooked
        is slightly more suitable, alternatively rice can be
        replaced by rice flour</li>
    <li>pasta does not really lend itself to blending, it ends up
        as a rather unpalatable rubbery lump (try some of the
        really tiny pasta shapes instead, such as ‘stellette’
        = little stars, or alphabet pasta)</li>
    <li>soft white bread can be troublesome because it tends to be
        sticky (rye bread (possibly crust removed) from a proper
        bakery is much less sticky)</li>
    <li>mashed potatoes are sticky because of the relatively large
        amount of starch in potatoes and tend to be difficult
        to swallow. That can be overcome by using lots of lubrication
        such as cream or butter (as an alternative, use sweet
        potatoes for a much less starchy mash)</li>
    <li>minced meat in dishes such as Bolognese sauce tends to have
        a somewhat awkward crumbly texture. It works better if
        you get lean mince from a butcher and ask them to mince
        it twice (the traditional Italian way), then puree the
        Bolognese sauce after cooking.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also usually comes as a surprise that for many afflicted by
    dysphagia, the most difficult form of food to swallow are
    liquids. When considering the mechanics and the complicated
    <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">process of swallowing</a>,
    it becomes much clearer why that is the case. Fortunately,
    there are many different ways to thicken liquids and to turn
    them into jellies so that everybody can stay well hydrated,
    despite this swallowing challenge.</p>
<p>You may also find yourself repeatedly in a position of having
    to explain to well-meaning helpers and friends why mashed
    potatoes, or soft white bread, are such a sticky challenge,
    especially if you suffer from dry mouth. You will need to
    be generous and patient about this: it is hard to imagine
    dysphagia, or dry mouth or any similar oral-food processing
    problems for those who have not experienced such problems
    themselves. Try and communicate all this frankly to those
    who support you, it will help them to help you!</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb if you are able to swallow enough power drinks
    or supplements to keep going, try to feed yourself with enjoyable,
    proper, texture-adjusted foods, <a href="/help/oral-food/nutrition">possibly enriched</a>    as much as possible (and consider power drinks and supplements
    as a plan B, or just as supplements to enrich your normal
    foods) – far more pleasure to be had from ‘real food’!</p>
<p>It may be useful to keep a <a href="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-nutrition-level2-diary-printable.pdf">food diary</a>    as this will give useful information about the calories and
    possibly missing nutrients in your daily food intake over
    a period of time.</p>
<h1 id="distorted-taste-/-lack-of-appetite">Distorted taste / lack of appetite</h1>
<p>Our <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">senses of taste</a> and smell
    are a complicated machinery, designed to distinguish bitter,
    salty, sweet, sour and umami (‘savoury’) flavours. When this
    machinery is compromised this can take many different forms.
    You may find that the smell of food puts you off, that everything
    tastes like saw dust, that some foods taste ‘wrong’ or give
    you a lingering bad taste in the mouth, and so on. Most importantly,
    make sure that these effects do not cause an aversion to
    eating altogether, there are ways to manage impaired taste
    – and even enjoy food.</p>
<p>Avoid off-putting foods and look for foods that at the time taste
    and smell good. These may be rather different from your normal
    favourite dishes and may include some apparently crazy combinations.
    Many find umami (savoury) tastes (and smells) most appetising.
    You may find that cold food tastes better. Be prepared that
    taste confusions change over time. What is revoltingly horrible
    this week may well be back on the agenda two weeks on. Keep
    on trying what works best and be prepared for sudden and
    surprising changes.</p>
<p>Only you can know what works for the moment and if somebody else
    helps you with the cooking, do let them know about your current
    preferences.</p>
<p>It is a good idea not to experiment with your favourite food(s)
    from the old days. It is very disappointing if, for the moment,
    you can’t enjoy it but can perfectly well remember how it
    should feel and taste. It may discourage you from eating
    altogether. Keep your favourite dishes from the old days
    on the list for later, to be re-visited when you are confident
    that you can actually enjoy them.</p>
<p>If the smell of food is a problem, eat cold and frozen foods.
    Ask somebody to help you with the cooking as that will minimise
    your exposure to the smell of foods. At the other extreme,
    you may find the intense aroma of essential oils helpful
    to improve your appetite. A lingering bad taste in the mouth
    can be counteracted by chewing on cloves, or just keeping
    them in the mouth.</p>
<p>Naturally we all have an appetite for refreshing acidic flavours
    such as that of lemons or oranges. If these are far too acidic
    to enjoy by mouth, make use of your nose as much of our flavour
    experiences actually stem from the smell of foods. Just clip
    a slice of lemon or orange on your cup or mug, that gets
    it close to your nose when you drink and can satisfy an appetite
    for a refreshing lemon flavour without causing problems with
    acidity.  </p>
<p>Your taste buds are recovering, you are getting tired of bland
    foods but can’t handle spicy foods? Your kitchen window sill
    or your garden (or grocery shop) can help. Grow flavoursome
    herbs, lots of them (basil, lovage, mint, lemon balm, chives,
    flat-leafed parsley, sage, coriander, tarragon, dill all
    work well). If you can manage generous amounts of finely
    chopped fresh herbs in your food – just add these to your
    food before serving. Some people find that freshly chopped
    herbs are helpful with dry mouth troubles (that may be because
    of the (literally) mouth-watering properties of the smells
    of chopped fresh herbs). If you can’t, or don’t want to,
    have bits of chopped herbs in your food, you can add fresh
    herbs while cooking and simply pass your food through a sieve
    before serving it.</p>
<p>Should you be in the mood for a bit of kitchen experimentation,
    here is a little trick that also avoids having to remove
    bits of chopped fresh herbs from your food. Get yourself
    a rock-bottom cheap small Italian espresso jug (the version
    that you heat on your stove). Stuff roughly chopped herb
    leaves in the filter compartment (where normally the coffee
    powder would go), put a little bit of water in the bottom
    part as usual and heat briefly as you would normally do for
    making espresso. The rising steam extracts the flavour from
    the chopped leaves and you will have an intensely herb-flavoured
    infusion in the bottom part of the jug (the steam-treated
    leaves will look a bit sorry). Use that infusion to add flavour
    to your food (freeze any surplus in small portions for later
    use).</p>
<p>A selection of spices which add flavour and variety to your food
    without creating unpleasant sharpness / hotness are cloves,
    cardamom, bay leave, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, caraway
    seeds, ground nutmeg, cumin, star anise (see Figure 3). You
    can put the spices in a tea egg for easy removal after cooking.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A selection of flavoursone and
        versatile spices. Left column, from top: caraway seeds,
        ground nutmeg, fennel seeds, star anis; middle column,
        from top: ground cadamom, ground coriander, turmeric
        powder, ground cumin; right column, from top: cardamom
        pods, coriander seeds, cloves, cumin seeds.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two special candidates amongst the useful spices: cinnamon
    and vanilla (see Figure 4). Both of these are not only suitable
    for sweet dishes but are also delicious in savoury recipes
    (cinnamon is one of the main components of most curry powder
    / masala mixtures). An example would be the combination of
    fresh wilted spinach with a little butter and vanilla which
    is delicious. These two spices are special because their
    ‘taste’ to a large degree we actually notice by smelling
    rather than tasting them. That makes them useful candidates
    for flavouring food when your sense of taste is compromised
    but your sense of smell is working.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-practical-tips-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Left: a vanilla pod (top) and
        seeds scraped out (bottom); right: two different varieties
        of cinnamon sticks/ bark (top) and ground cinnamon (bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When spicy foods are problematic the most commonly troublesome
    spices are pepper (black more so than white), hot paprika,
    cayenne, any kind or form of chillies, hot curry-powder mixtures,
    vinegars, lime or lemon juice, hot mustard and horseradish
    (see Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-practical-tips-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Potentially problematic spices,
        use with care. Top row, from left: hot chilli sauce,
        gratd horseradish, hot prepared mustard; middle row,
        from left: dried chilli flakes, hot paprika powder, cayenne;
        bottom row, from left: hot curry / masala powder, crushed
        black pepper corns and black pepper corns.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Tomatoes, peppers and some fruit (some varieties of tart apples,
    for example) can also be difficult because of their acidity.
    Using a spritz of lemon or lime juice, or a small amount
    of prepared mustard, to enhance the flavour of creamy sauces
    and soups or other dairy-based dishes normally does not cause
    any problems with acidity.</p>
<p>If everything tastes like saw dust, try tart foods and use strong
    flavours and spices, if you can manage those. Try enhancing
    the flavour of your food with lemon juice or other fruit
    juices, or wine if you can tolerate acidity.</p>
<p>If you feel that you need a break from dairy products, try almond,
    soy or coconut milk as an alternative.</p>
<p>Many people find red meats problematic, and most can enjoy food
    based on dairy, eggs, fish and white meats.</p>
<p>It is likely that a ‘normal’ / conventional three-meals-a-day
    pattern will not work particularly well while you find eating
    difficult. Ignore conventions and eat when you are ready,
    whatever you fancy within your comfort zone of food preparations
    at whatever time – there are no laws that enshrine eating
    times and composition of meals. If this can include the odd
    social occasion of sharing food / eating with others and
    sitting down together at the table, even better. You may
    discover that some children who normally refuse to eat vegetables
    are quite happy to eat wobbly, colourful vegetable jellies.</p>
