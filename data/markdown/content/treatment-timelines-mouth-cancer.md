<p>Speed and quality of recovery from mouth cancer depends on the
    treatment (from relatively minor surgery to extremely complex
    surgery and <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>),
    on personal circumstances and support, and last but not least
    on attitude.</p>
<p>For everyone the diagnosis of mouth cancer is a shock psychologically,
    and the treatment is a shock, of varying degrees of magnitude,
    physically and physiologically. We can only hope to paint
    a general picture in this timeline section. We try to do
    this by describing three different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>circumstances that only require a relatively ‘minor’ surgical
        intervention; surgery the only treatment modality;</li>
    <li>circumstances that require major surgery, including <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>;
        with surgery the only treatment modality;</li>
    <li>circumstances that require major surgery, including <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>;
        combined with <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>        and/or <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three scenarios can only give a crude, general overall
    impression. More detailed information as it applies to an
    individual and their specific condition and treatment, is
    best obtained from the consultant(s) and cancer nurse specialist(s)
    in charge.</p>
<h1 id="after-relatively-minor-surgical-intervention">After relatively minor surgical intervention</h1>
<p>After relatively minor treatment, for example a wide local excision
    of a tongue cancer with or without <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">neck dissection</a>    (we use the term ‘minor’ in a technical sense, to distinguish
    treatment range, it is obviously not ‘minor’ to a patient)
    the following course of events will be experienced to some
    degree. The following description assumes a local excision
    with (or without) selective neck dissection, no reconstruction
    or post-operative radiotherapy.</p>
<h2>Short term</h2>
<p>At least an overnight stay in hospital. If the excision is combined
    with a neck dissection a drain (or two) will be inserted
    and a stay of several days in hospital is required until
    there is minimal drainage (less than 50 ml in 8 hours). The
    mouth will feel raw and sore. This will need <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">painkillers</a>     and the mouth has to be kept as clean as possible. If a
    <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">laser</a>    has been used to excise the cancer, the area which looks
    burnt has to be kept clean. This is called an eschar and
    is basically a third degree burn which will eventually fall
    off leaving a healed area. Sometimes the area is sutured
    with dissolving stitches. This often feels very tight. The
    stitches dissolve and it is actually not unusual for the
    wound to open up to some degree during healing. About 10
    % of patients will have some bleeding from these kinds of
    wounds during the early post-operative period.</p>
<p>During this time eating and drinking can be a substantial concern
    and quite uncomfortable. Our section about <a href="/help/oral-food">oral food intake</a>    explains some of the things that can be done to help during
    this time.</p>
<p>The neck may be operated on in two different ways (or not at
    all) in relatively ‘minor’ operations.</p>
<p>One way, felt by some to reduce the overall burden of surgery
    to patients, involves taking only one lymph node out for
    examination by a specialist pathologist. This is called
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">sentinel lymph node biopsy</a>. The idea is that this node
        is the first one a mouth cancer will spread to. This
        is worked out using a radioactive isotope. This is injected
        into the cancer at its presenting site, the isotope drains
        to the first draining lymph node for that cancer site
        and that node is confirmed by measuring the presence
        of the isotope. Sometimes a dye is used but this has
        largely been superseded by the isotope method. The node
        is marked on the skin and arrangements made to remove
        the lymph node.The node is then <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">examined histologically</a>.
        This whole process can take a week. If the node has no
        cancer, no more surgery is needed. If it has cancer,
        then a <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/mouth-cancer/more-info">conventional neck dissection</a>        is undertaken within a couple of weeks. This is logistically
        complicated in the UK and not practiced everywhere (it
        has been recommended by NICE (The National Institute
        for Health and Care Excellence), but not by several leading
        national and international head and neck cancer organisations).</p>
<p>Another way is to remove the most likely nodes to contain cancer
    at the same time as the tumour is removed. This involves
    the risk of unnecessary surgery if there are no cancer deposits
    in the removed nodes but avoids the delay and possibility
    of a second operation. If carried out, there will be stitches
    or metal staples in the skin of the neck for 10 days and,
    as mentioned above, drains which may require a hospital for
    3 to 5 days. The biggest problems likely are stiffness of
    the shoulder and numbness of the skin over the operated area.
    Pain is not usually a problem.</p>
<h2>Medium term</h2>
<p>Within a couple of months, the eschar will have fallen off, leaving
    a clean scarred wound which usually feels numb. <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">Taste</a>    may be affected to a greater or lesser degree. Pain will
    usually have gone. Talking should largely have returned to
    normal.</p>
<p>Shoulder stiffness can persist and the <a href="/help/physiotherapy">physiotherapy exercises</a>    which may not have seemed so important in the early phase
    should be carried out regularly. The numbness is usually
    less of an issue.</p>
<h2>Long term</h2>
<p>With this sort of surgery, long term problems tend to be minimal
    and between 3 and 6 months eating, drinking, talking and
    use of the shoulder should all have reached a stage of ‘new
    normal’. That is, they may not be exactly what they were
    before the cancer developed, but a situation will have been
    reached where everyday functions can be carried out in a
    slightly different but acceptable way. The scars will remain,
    as will areas of altered sensation but most people find ways
    to carry on with their life in the way they wish around about
    this time.</p>
<h1 id="after-major-surgical-intervention-and-reconstruction">After major surgical intervention and reconstruction</h1>
<p>This kind of surgical intervention is quite different and will
    involve anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks in hospital for highly
    complex surgery involving removing the cancer, treating the
    draining lymph nodes and reconstructing the defect created.
    Of major importance is healing to a degree so that <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">post-operative radiotherapy</a>    (often but not always required or recommended in this situation)
    can start approximately 6 weeks after surgery. There should
    be substantial input from the entire head and neck cancer
    team of surgeon, clinical oncologist, cancer nurse specialist,
    speech and language therapist and dietician prior to surgery.
    Any issues related to <a href="/diagnosis/drugs">drug or alcohol dependency</a>    should also be addressed and may require a period of time
    in hospital prior to surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Short term</strong>.</p>
<p>This is major surgery and will require admission to hospital
    usually at least the day before surgery, although it may
    be considerably before in the case of in-patient detoxification
    if this is needed. Around this time, it is likely to meet
    the anaesthetist(s), if that has not happened earlier. Many
    centres will spend the entire day performing the surgery
    and this is then followed by an overnight period in the intensive
    treatment (care) unit where monitoring under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">heavy sedation or anaesthesia</a>    is carried out overnight. It is usual for this only to be
    for one night and the rest of inpatient care to be carried
    out on the admitting ward.</p>
<p>Each day would normally see a lessening of the monitoring and
    care requirements. For example, invasive blood pressure monitoring
    usually stops on the first post-operative day, intensive
    flap monitoring decreases over the first three days, drains
    are usually removed ‘when they stop draining’ (usually less
    than 50 ml a day) but this is usually around the fifth day.
    Tracheostomies are usually removed within this time period
    as well (there is a variable requirement at this stage to
    confirm it is safe to <a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">swallow</a>    saliva without aspiration.</p>
<p>Mobilisation starts variably between day 2 and day 5. Central
    venous lines are usually removed around day 2 or 3 but may
    be kept if securing a good arm vein is difficult. By the
    second week most drains should be removed and an attempt
    at normal feeding resumed (it is usual to avoid food and
    non-clear liquid crossing the operation site in the mouth
    by using <a href="/help/non-oral-food">nasogastric or percutaneous gastrostomy feeding</a>.
    Intravenous drips have usually been stopped or reduced to
    a single peripheral cannula by this stage.</p>
<p>Finally, full mobilisation, confirmation of a safe swallow (one
    which does not cause aspiration of liquids), removal of nasogastric
    tube (although percutaneous gastrostomy may be left longer
    term) is carried out and discharge home with appropriate
    support planned.</p>
<h2>Medium term</h2>
<p>All the aspects of the less major surgery apply. In addition,
    the wounds created by tracheostomy and flap and graft harvest
    each have their own problems and are specific to the site
    of surgery.</p>
<p>Importantly during the first 6 to 8 weeks it is expected that
    the tracheostomy site will heal, the sutures will all dissolve
    (or have been removed prior to discharge) and the wounds
    on the neck, flap donor site, mouth and face will have achieved
    initial healing. Mobilisation is important and a small degree
    of recovery of energy (in comparison to what was ‘normal’
    before) should be achieved.</p>
<h2>Long term</h2>
<p>All the issues with less major surgery again apply, but now has
    to include the full <a href="/help/salt">recovery of speaking and swallowing</a>    after tracheostomy and the completely different sensations
    of non-natural tissue inside the mouth (the mouth is not
    meant to be lined with skin and although sensation recovers
    to a degree it is never the same. Interestingly, almost everyone
    learns to live with this).</p>
<p>The impact long term of the various <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">donor sites for flaps and grafts</a>    vary depending on site but a degree of altered sensation,
    relative weakness in grip strength or limp can last for months
    or even be permanent. As with many of these anticipated post-operation
    difficulties, most people adapt around them to continue their
    life in a different but satisfactory way.</p>
<h1 id="after-major-surgical-intervention-reconstruction-and-radiotherapy">After major surgical intervention, reconstruction and radiotherapy</h1>
<p><strong>Short term</strong>.</p>
<p>All the above applies, but with an emphasis on being healed in
    time to start <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>.</p>
<h2>Medium term</h2>
<p>Early but complete initial wound healing during the initial 6
    to 8 week period is important to help with the onset of radiotherapy.
    Radiotherapy is a slow build-up of physiological challenge,
    in complete opposite to the surgical treatment which is all
    up front followed by gradual recovery.</p>
<p>It is important that there are no open wounds before starting
    radiotherapy (even more so if <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    is being added to the treatment) as the risk of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>    is high and failure of the wounds to heal becomes a real
    risk.</p>
<p>The major impact of the radiotherapy treatment comes in the final
    weeks and potentially for months after completion where the
    skin feels like very bad sunburn, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">candida superinfection</a>    is common and a <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>    becomes a substantial problem.</p>
<h2>Long term</h2>
<p>In addition to the major and minor surgical effects, therapeutic
    radiation carries lifelong tissue changes. Long term skin
    sensitivity to sun is a lifelong issue. A dry mouth is very
    common and a <a href="/treatment/surgery/xerostomia">variety of techniques</a>    have been designed to palliate (but not cure) xerostomia.
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">Limited opening of the mouth</a>    is commonplace secondary to scarring and fibrosis of the
    muscles around the jaw.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">sense of taste</a>    and ability to chew and swallow can be affected and have
    a substantial impact on quality of life.</p>
<p><a href="/help">The sections on help and selfhelp</a>    aim to inform about a variety of non-medical strategies to
    improve some of these, usually inevitable consequences of
    treatment of mouth cancer.</p>
