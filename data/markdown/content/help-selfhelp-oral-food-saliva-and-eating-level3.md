<h1 id="composition-of-saliva"><a href="/help/oral-food/further-reading"><strong>Composition of saliva</strong></a></h1>
<p>Saliva is a nearly neutral (that is neither alkaline nor acidic)
    aqueous solution. Like all body fluids it contains a number
    of electrolytes (that is inorganic ions) such as Na<sup>+</sup>,
    K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> cations,
    and Cl<sup>-</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>,
    I<sup>-</sup> and F<sup>-</sup> anions. Saliva is super-concentrated
    in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> ions and
    in this way prevents teeth dissolving in this aqueous electrolyte
    solution. The electrolytes, in particular HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,
    act as a buffer (that is they balance and maintain the pH
    value such that there are no large pH fluctuations).</p>
<p>The taste of salt only is noticed if the concentration of Na+
    ions in the food is higher than the natural concentration
    in saliva. Some or all of the electrolytes are also likely
    to play a role in activating taste buds.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about how taste buds work, there
        is more information on our detailed page about <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste and texture of food</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Organic components of saliva include a number of proteins and
    amino acids. Of the proteins in saliva amylase, statherin
    and mucins are most relevant for the process of chewing,
    tasting and swallowing. Other proteins such as lysozyme or
    lactoferrin are more important for the role of <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">saliva in protecting teeth and oral health</a>    in general.</p>
<h1 id="functional-organic-components-of-saliva-relevant-for-eating"><a href="/help/oral-food/further-reading"><strong>Functional organic components of saliva relevant for eating</strong></a></h1>
<h2>Statherin</h2>
<p>Statherin is a typical example of an amphiphilic organic / biochemical
    molecule, a phospholipid with a polar hydrophilic end (hydrophilic
    means water loving) and a non-polar hydrophobic end (hydrophobic
    means water hating, sometimes equivalent with fat loving).
    The vastly different properties of the two ends of such molecules
    account for their important roles in living creatures as
    well as in technical systems.</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/level3/figure1.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Two different conformations of
        the statherin molecule; left the wrapped up folded conformation,
        right the elongated unfolded conformation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the overall structure and function of the
    statherin molecule. The left part of Figure 1 shows the molecule
    in its folded up conformation, broadly exposing its hydrophilic
    polar end. In this conformation the polar phosphate end of
    the molecule attaches itself to the surface (the enamel)
    of teeth where it helps to <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">protect teeth</a>    and to yield a smooth surface of teeth in order to protect
    tongue and mucosa. This is sometimes termed a “biofilm”.
    The right part of Figure 1 shows the statherin molecule in
    its unfolded elongated conformation. In this form it functions
    mainly as an emulsifier of food, helping to produce a smooth
    and slippery bolus that is easy to swallow.</p>
<h2>Amylase</h2>
<p>Amylase is a typical example of a large protein molecule belonging
    to the class of enzymes. Enzymes are nature’s biochemical
    versions of a man-made technical catalyst: they help to make
    a (bio)chemical reaction happen but do not get used up or
    modified in the process. Like almost all catalysts, enzymes
    typically depend on the presence of some metal ion(s) in
    order to function in their role (think of the noble metal
    catalyst in the exhaust of a car that enables the conversion
    of toxic gases to less toxic ones).</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/level3/figure2.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A sketch of the overall structure
        and functional units of the alpha-amylase molecule: the
        polar domain B enforces a particular shape and conformation
        of the molecule and helps it to attach to the surface
        of teeth; domain A contains the central active site of
        the molecule, a central barrel-shaped hollow area that
        is fit to host starch molecules in order to break them
        down into smaller units which are then released.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 2 shows a sketch of the overall structure and function
    of the alpha-amylase molecule. Its function as an enzyme
    depends on the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>    ions. Its role as an enzyme is to enable the breaking down
    of large carbohydrate molecules in food (such as starch in
    potatoes) into smaller units while chewing. This helps both
    with pre-digestion and with the production of a soft and
    easy to swallow bolus. The related role of alpha-amylase
    in terms of oral health is to help <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">clearing the mouth</a>    from debris after eating, including hard to reach spaces
    such as between teeth. Alpha-amylase is mostly contained
    in the on-demand saliva made in the parotid gland while eating.</p>
<p>Figure 2 further highlights an important general principle in
    all biochemical reactions – form and function need to go
    hand in hand: only if the size and shape of a starch molecule
    fits very well with the grooves and overall shape of the
    alpha-amylase molecule will there be a chance for a successful
    reaction. The donut-shaped barrel in the centre of the alpha-amylase
    molecule is its active site and is perfectly set up to accommodate
    a starch molecule in order to trigger the breakdown of the
    large starch molecule into smaller (sugar) units (starch
    is a large polymer molecule made up from many small sugar
    molecules (glucose monomers) fused together). The underlying
    actual chemical reaction is a simple acid/base reaction.</p>
<aside>
    <p>If you’d like to know more about the polymeric sugar molecules
        in starch, there is more information on our detailed
        page about <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">taste and texture of food</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h2>Mucins</h2>
<p>Mucins are a family of typically very large molecules made up
    from a protein backbone with ordered and chaotic sections
    and side-branches consisting of sugar molecules. Two particular
    mucins are found in saliva: a smaller one (MUC7) as depicted
    in Figure 3 (top) and a very large one (MUC5B, Figure 3 middle).</p>
<figure><img src="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating/level3/figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The two mucin proteins found in
        saliva. Top: MUC7 is the smaller variety of molecular
        size 200-300kDa, a compact conformation (kDa is a unit
        commonly used in biology and biochemistry to measure
        the size of molecules. For example, a MUC7 molecule is
        roughly 11.00 to 16.000 times the molecular weight of
        a water molecule). Middle: MUC5B is an unfolded much
        larger mucin protein of a molecular size exceeding 1000kDa.
        MUC5B is able to form gels. Bottom: the <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">gel-forming principle</a>        of MUC5B with large aggregates that can accommodate large
        quantities of water molecules by attaching them to the
        branched sugar side-chains.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Their role is predominantly to give saliva its <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">viscosity</a>,
    making it sufficiently sticky to not be easily washed away.
    In terms of interactions with food and swallowing, especially
    the elongated very large MUC5B molecules have an important
    role: because of the ability of the branched sugar side-chains
    to hold on to water molecules (illustrated schematically
    in Figure 3 bottom), MUC5B can form very large aggregates
    which will give particular degrees of slipperiness and viscosity
    to a bolus and are thus likely to play an important role
    in the signalling and regulation of the swallowing process
    – as they render saliva a non-Newtonian fluid (that is a
    fluid the viscosity of which depends on the shear forces
    acting on it).</p>
<h2>Artificial saliva</h2>
<p>Given the truly important role of saliva in enabling eating,
    chewing and swallowing, it comes as no surprise that quite
    a selection of so-called artificial salivas are commercially
    available for people suffering from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a>.
    It probably comes as no surprise that there really is no
    artificial replacement available that would come anywhere
    near the amazing properties of natural saliva. It is difficult
    to mimic the properties of saliva, given the complicated
    feedback loops and production modes, depending on demand
    or rest that govern the <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">properties of natural saliva</a>.
    But it does not hurt to try if any of these artificial preparations
    help to relieve symptoms of dry mouth and/or help with eating.</p>
<p>Commercial artificial saliva preparations come in quite a range
    of compositions. Some essentially just mimic the inorganic
    electrolyte composition of ‘whole mouth’ saliva (a mixture
    of on-demand and at-rest saliva). Some products are more
    focussed on the organic components of saliva with either
    an emphasis on (some form of) mucin, or on proteins with
    a major role in maintaining oral health. The available preparations
    include sprays, lozenges or gels. It makes sense to avoid
    products that are acidic in order to protect your teeth and
    to prefer products that contain F<sup>-</sup> ions to enhance
    the protection of teeth.</p>
<p>Many patients report that the various different kinds of artificial
    saliva merely provide some minor improvement of mouth feeling,
    some fresh feeling often predominantly from the flavouring
    added to the preparations. Some people report that in particular
    gel preparations are helpful with prolonging uninterrupted
    periods of sleep. With regard to <a href="/help/oral-food/lubrication">ease of eating and swallowing</a>    some alternative coping strategies may individually work
    better.</p>
