<p>Infection is the general term describing invasion of the body
    by <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microorganisms</a>,
    including bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi/spores.
    Antibiotic is the general term for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection">drugs used to treat infections</a>    (anti-biotic literally means anti-life). Antibiotics include
    drugs with antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic
    properties.</p>
<p>Infection by parasites does not play a major role in the industrialised
    parts of the world (with the possible exception of <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">toxoplasmosis</a>    which usually does not even require treatment). However,
    it should be kept in mind that worldwide <i>ca</i>. 2 billion
    people suffer from some variety of parasitic, sometimes deadly,
    infection at any given time.</p>
<p>Bacterial, viral and fungal infections, however, are all highly
    relevant in an oral and maxillofacial context: the oral and
    maxillofacial region is the major interface between an individual
    and the external environment. As a result the region is constantly
    exposed to microorganisms that may give rise to infection;
    infectious processes are of major importance in oral and
    maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>Three areas, each with their own specific microflora, are of
    importance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the cutaneous regions (skin) of the face</li>
    <li>the oral cavity (mouth)</li>
    <li>the nasal cavity (nose) and paranasal air sinuses (air-filled
        spaces in the vicinity of the nose).</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire region can be afflicted by a wide range of acute and/or
    chronic bacterial and fungal infections, as well as by viral
    infections. The severity of infections covers the whole range
    from trivial to life threatening. In many instances prophylaxis
    (prevention of infection) is crucially important. In some
    instances, treatment of bacterial or viral infections can
    lead to an increased risk of fungal infections (opportunistic
    infections).</p>
