    sections of our website:</p>

    <li><a href="/treatment/surgery">surgery</a></li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a></li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a></li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication">medication</a></li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">extreme temperatures</a></li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen">hyperbaric oxygen</a></li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/photodynamic-therapy">photodynamic therapy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some established treatment modalities are not covered by these
    sections; mostly because they are rarely used. The collection
    of miscellaneous treatment options below covers these modalities.
    The content of this page is given in alphabetical order for
    convenience.</p>
