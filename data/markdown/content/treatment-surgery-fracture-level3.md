<p>The following information is quite technical, dealing with specific
    fracture repair techniques, depending on location &amp; type
    of fracture(s). This section is organised in terms of locations,
    starting with mandible, then zygomatic complex (cheekbone)
    fractures, nasal fractures, midface fractures, frontal bone
    &amp; frontal sinus fractures.</p>
<h1 id="treatment-of-mandibular-fractures">Treatment of mandibular fractures</h1>
<p><i>Immediate</i> treatment in the primary survey is rare. Early
    treatment involves analgesia, either in the form of nonsteroidal
    anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids. Oral or intravenous antibiotics
    are given because, by definition, all mandibular fractures
    passing through the tooth-bearing segment and periodontal
    ligament are compound fractures into the mouth and therefore
    contaminated (Condylar fragments and fractures which do not
    communicate with the periodontal ligament are <i>closed</i>    injuries and do not require antibiotics. However if there
    is a cutaneous wound caused by the fracture fragment, or
    by penetration of a foreign body, they are compound fractures
    and so require antibiotics).</p>
<p>Displaced, mobile fractures are very painful. The placement of
    temporary stabilising wires around the teeth adjacent to
    the mandibular fracture will immobilize the fracture and
    make the patient more comfortable while awaiting definitive
    surgery under <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">general anaesthesia</a>.
    This can help to reduce the need for analgesics in the preoperative
    period.</p>
<h2>Treatment Planning</h2>
<p>Mandibular fractures with altered occlusion are best treated
    by surgery (excluding condylar fractures, see below). Fracture
    treatment involves reduction of bone ends and stabilisation
    to allow healing. Some minimally or undisplaced hairline
    fractures can be treated without surgery as long as the occlusion
    is not altered. Sometimes the patient will elect not to have
    surgery and will accept the slightly altered occlusion. Informed
    choice must be respected and documented in this instance.
    Close follow up is advised although the reality of trauma
    patient follow up in most countries and most published series
    is that they are a very reluctant patient cohort when it
    comes to hospital attendance.</p>
<h2>Preoperative consent</h2>
<p>Preoperative assessment of inferior alveolar nerve injury must
    be documented, as it may become worse postoperatively. Most
    mandibular fractures are approached transorally. External
    approaches are used particularly for edentulous (no teeth)
    body fractures and condylar fractures. These incisions cause
    a scar and there is a small risk of damage to the facial
    nerve. Placement of plates (whether they are intended to
    be permanent or to be removed) is likely, loss of teeth is
    possible, intermaxillary fixation (if used) may be necessary.</p>
<h2>Mandibular Fracture Repair</h2>
<p>Definitive surgery usually involves open reduction and internal
    fixation (ORIF) under general anaesthesia, ideally using
    nasoendotracheal intubation. This allows the patient’s mouth
    to be closed and the teeth to be manipulated into their normal
    occlusion. This manipulation helps reduce the mandible into
    the prefracture bone position. Temporary intermaxillary fixation
    (IMF) is applied using a variety of techniques (trainee’s
    hand, eyelets, transalveolar screws (see Figure 1 and Figure
    2), ‘rapid IMF’, arch bars). This helps to hold the fracture
    in its reduced position. Placing a bridle wire or tension
    band around the teeth can help reduce and temporarily fix
    the fracture.</p>

</figure>
<p>Under direct vision via buccal sulcus incisions (incision in
    the depression between cheek and arch of jaw) the mandibular
    fracture is exposed and reduction confirmed (see Figure 3).</p>

        dissection and tension band in place.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fixation is undertaken with titanium mandibular plates.  According
    to <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading"><i>Champy’s principles</i></a>,
    in the mandibular symphyseal and parasymphyseal (the middle
    region of the mandible) region two mandibular plates are
    required, one just below the level of incisor/premolar apices
    and above the mental foramen and one as low down on the buccal
    surface as possible parallel to the lower border of the mandible.
    This is shown in Figure 4.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed/figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Fixation with two monocortical
        (ie a single – outer dense cortical table is engaged
        rather than both, which could transgress the neurovascular
        structures within the bone) titanium plates.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the region of the angle of the mandible, a single plate is
    adequate to allow healing. In practice many surgeons now
    supplement this (or even replace it) with a transbuccally
    placed lateral plate which prevents lateral displacement
    of the lower border of the mandible. All these techniques
    use monocortically placed matching titanium screws to retain
    the plates which immobilise the fracture sites.  Long-acting
    local anaesthetic regional block provides good postoperative
    analgesia and prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics are
    given preoperatively. Intraoral wounds are closed with resorbable
    sutures. If the occlusion is fully restored and stability
    of the fracture is assured by the plates, the intermaxillary
    fixation can be removed. Postoperative radiographs are taken
    to ensure correct placement of plates and screws and accurate
    realignment of mandibular fragments. It is also important
    to reassess the position of the condyles following ORIF as
    malpositioning can lead to TMJ problems later on (see Figure
    5).</p>

        reduction and fixation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Mandibular fractures in children</strong>: fractures
    in children up to six years of age normally receive conservative
    treatment. An indication for osteosynthesis (reduction and
    fixation of a fracture) may be a simple or multiple fracture
    with displacement, especially when the possibilities of conservation
    fixation are limited.</p>
<p>In such cases two aspects that may be taken into account include,
    first, that a single 1.5 mm microplate is normally sufficient
    for the stabilization of the fracture, and second, because
    of the position of the teeth germs, the microplate should
    always be placed at the lower border of the buccal side.
    Fractures of the jaw in children 6 to13 years old require
    attention to the tooth germs.</p>
<p><strong>Mandibular fractures in elderly patients</strong>: atrophic
    ‘pencil thin’ or ‘pipe stem’ mandibular fractures are common
    in elderly edentulous (toothless) patients and can be devastating
    to the elderly patient (see Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed/figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Displaced fracture of the thin
        edentulous mandible.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Malunion and even non-union are common and eating and nutrition
    deteriorate rapidly. Fracture repair is best done by keeping
    the maximum possible amount of periosteum intact and plating
    via an extraoral approach using a more rigid plate with bicortical
    screws that confer far greater rigidity and stability to
    the fracture site (see Figure 7 and Figure 8). This approach
    carries a greater risk of damage to the inferior alveolar
    neurovascular bundle but is balanced by the far higher success
    rate compared with conservative or monocortical plating techniques.</p>

        the genial muscle points of attachment.</figcaption>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Continuity restored with a 2.4
        mm reconstruction plate and direct suturing of genial
        muscles.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are unfavourable conditions for healing in fractures of
    the atrophic edentulous mandible, such as a reduced cross-section
    and smaller contact area of the fractured ends as well as
    usually dense and sclerotic bone that is poorly vascularised.</p>
<p>However, because in extremely atrophic mandibles the subperiosteal
    plexus is probably the major blood supply to the bone, a
    supraperiostal dissection has been suggested and a supraperiosteal
    placement of plates and screws were recommended in the
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">literature</a> (personal experience with this technique showed
        it to be totally unhelpful as soft tissue ingrowth from
        the periosteum (membrane surrounding bone) loosened the
        screws far too early).</p>
<p>The advantage of rigid fixation is that it makes any postoperative
    maxillomandibular immobilization unnecessary. It allows free
    movement of the mandible, normal speech, and immediate uptake
    of a soft, solid diet and thus provides greater comfort for
    the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Condylar fractures</strong>: these are the most common
    mandibular fractures. They are treated conservatively in
    children up to 12 years with soft diet, analgesia and function.
    Young adults (12-18) are also treated conservatively in the
    majority of cases. Adults (&gt;18) are treated with 7-10
    days of heavy elastic IMF (fixation) and the occlusion reassessed.
    If malocclusion persists then ORIF of the condyle is undertaken.
    Overlap of fragments greater than 5 mm and angulation greater
    than 37°are postulated to warrant ORIF. Logically the function
    rather than the radiographic appearance should predicate
    the decision to undertake ORIF (see Figure 9 and Figure 10
    for illustration).</p>

        a fractured mandibular condyle.</figcaption>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Radiograph of reduced and fixed
        condylar fracture showing two techniques.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A trend is emerging in the <a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading">surgical literature</a>    confirming superior functional results following ORIF of
    condylar fractures, where this is indicated. This is supported
    by existing evidence. Endoscopic assistance, performed transorally,
    may also provide an alternative means for treating a subset
    of these injuries, reducing visible scar formation and possibly
    facial nerve damage.</p>
<p>There are still areas of condylar trauma surgery which some surgeons
    consider controversial: condylar head fractures and displaced
    paediatric fractures. The use of resorbable osteosynthesis
    techniques may be of benefit in both these clinical settings.
    Promising outcomes have been anecdotally reported following
    fixation of such fractures in children as young as 6 years
    of age. This finding is contrary to most accepted guidance
    which recognizes extensive condylar remodelling in children
    less than 12 years old.</p>
<p>Indications for ORIF of mandibular condyle fractures are either
    absolute (and applicable to children as well) and include
    displacement into the middle cranial fossa, impossibility
    of obtaining adequate occlusion by closed reduction, lateral
    extracapsular displacement of the condyle and invasion by
    a foreign body (for example, a gunshot wound). Relative indications
    apply to adults with condyles displaced out of the fossa
    and associated malocclusion and include: bilateral condylar
    fractures in an edentulous patient when a splint is unavailable
    or when splinting is impossible because of alveolar ridge
    atrophy; unilateral or bilateral condylar fractures when
    splinting is not recommended for medical reasons (such as
    seizures, psychiatric problems); bilateral condylar fractures
    associated with comminuted midfacial fractures; bilateral
    condylar fractures and associated gnathologic problems e.g.
    retrognathia  or prognathism, open bite with periodontal
    problems or lack of posterior support.</p>
<p>While condylar open reduction and fixation is heavily endorsed
    by some, it is worth looking carefully at the published examples
    – all too often cases are shown which are relatively easy
    to access and fix whereas others are quietly left as ‘technically
    not feasible’. The old adage ‘the ability to do an operation
    is not an indication’ is worth keeping in mind in this area
    of facial traumatology.</p>
<p>Open treatment of mandibular condyle fractures (retromandibular
    approach traversing the parotid capsule) is associated with
    morbidity; complications from open treatment include haemorrhage,
    infection, weakness of the facial nerve, auriculotemporal
    nerve dysfunction (affecting the mandibular joint and ear),
    Frey’s syndrome (abnormal sweating of the cheek) and unsightly
    scars.</p>
<p>Comparing open and closed treatment of mandibular condyle fractures
    indicates less pain with open treatment. Both treatment options
    for condylar fractures of the mandible yielded acceptable
    results. But operative treatment, irrespective of the method
    of internal fixation used, was superior in all objective
    and subjective functional parameters.</p>

<h2>Treatment aims</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Restoration of facial appearance</li>
    <li>Restoration of orbital volume, globe position and prevention
        of enophthalmus (posterior displacement of the eye)</li>
    <li>Repair of orbital floor fractures with reduction of herniated
        orbital contents and release of trapped inferior rectus
        muscle (muscle for eye movement)</li>
    <li>Decompression of infraorbital nerve, promoting recovery of

    <li>Restoration of full range of mandibular movements</li>
    <li>Restoration of a normal occlusion by reduction of zygomatic
        and tuberosity displacement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment planning</h2>
<p>Surgery is ideally carried out after most of the swelling has
    resolved, around 7 to 10 days after injury. Earlier surgery
    in the presence of oedema tends to create a higher risk of
    poor scarring, difficulty in access and ectropion (drooping
    lower eyelid). General anaesthesia with oral intubation is
    usual (small risk of a significant bleed after some zygomatic
    fracture reductions, so a cuffed tube rather than a laryngeal
    mask is preferable). The aim of surgery is to <i>reduce</i>    the fracture in order to restore the bone to its normal position.
    The bones are then <i>fixed</i> so that they heal in this
    position (Open Reduction Internal Fixation, ORIF). Occasionally
    the fracture locks into a stable position after reduction
    and no fixation is required.  The time between injury and
    operation should be used to obtain all necessary information
    and act on it (Hess charts (eye examination), CT scans and
    so forth).</p>
<h2>Preoperative consent</h2>
<p>There is possible scarring from plate insertion and orbital floor
    repair, and eyelid scarring. Chemosis (gross swelling of
    the conjunctiva) is common after transconjunctival incisions
    if that incision is used in accessing the infraorbital rim
    and floor. There is a risk of developing a retrobulbar haemorrhage
    after surgery (which would necessitate further, emergency,
    surgery).</p>
<h2>Zygomatic fracture repair</h2>
<p>Incisions to gain access to the fractures and place plates to
    stabilise the fracture after reduction include a temporal
    Gillies incision (see Figure 11),</p>

        the infraorbital rim.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>transconjunctival incision, subcilliary (eyelid) incision and
    intraoral buttress incision<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Zygomatic fractures including zygomatic arch fractures are reduced
    by inserting a hook under the body of the zygoma caudally
    (to the back) in a vertical line from the lateral canthus
    (angle between upper and lower eyelid). The hook is named
    after Stromeyer. Interestingly these surgical variants can
    be seen from unit to unit in the UK and internationally.</p>
<p>Reduction of a zygomatic fracture can be carried out in three
    ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Temporal approach - the incision is made in the hairline
        two fingerbreadths above the tip of the pinna (outer
        part of the ear). Skin, temporoparietal fascia and temporalis
        fascia are dissected while trying to avoid superficial
        temporal vessels (but ligation of these, if it happens,
        is not a disaster). An elevator is inserted just deep
        to the temporal fascia. It is passed along the lateral
        surface of the temporalis muscle and enters the natural
        space beneath the zygomatic arch deep to the zygoma.</li>
    <li>Percutaneous approach - a small stab incision in the cheek
        allows access for a bone hook to carry out the reduction.</li>
    <li>Intraoral approach (Keen  is the eponym in US) - an incision
        is made in the upper buccal sulcus (depression between
        cheeks and arch) to expose the fracture at the buttress
        (see Figure 13).</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed/figure13.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Miniplate sited at the zygomatic
        buttress.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The direction of reduction (elevation) is to reverse the direction
    of the movement of the zygoma due to the impact. This is
    generally in an upward and outward direction opposite to
    that causing the fracture in the first instance. The aim
    of reduction is to restore the bone fragments to their symmetrical
    pre-injury position. This is assessed by visual inspection
    after satisfactory elevation, unless the fracture lines are
    being directly exposed and visualised.  Elevation is generally
    easily achieved during the first fourteen days after injury.
    After this time the fracture has started to heal in its incorrect
    position and elevation can be more difficult. Simple fracture
    patterns may allow the fracture to be reduced into a stable
    position and require no formal fixation.   If the fracture
    falls back into an abnormal position after gentle palpation
    it is considered unstable and requires fixation.  Fixation
    is in the form of low profile titanium or resorbable plates
    (usually 1.0mm, 1.3mm or 1.5mm thick, but this is changing
    as technology improves) placed across one or more of the
    fracture sites (frontozygomatic, infraorbital or buttress).
    Titanium has been the material of choice since 2000. Resorbable
    plates and screws have more recently become available but
    have not yet displaced titanium as the material of choice
    (see Figure 14).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed/figure14.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 14:</strong> Bioresorbable plates.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Small, asymptomatic orbital floor defects require no treatment.
    If the patient has persistent diplopia (double vision), enophthalmos
    (displacement of the eyeball), or significant herniation
    of orbital contents into the antrum, repair is indicated.
    A bone graft from the outer table of skull (see Figure 15)
    or anterior wall of</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed/figure15.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 15:</strong> Split cranial bone graft fixed
        to reconstruct the orbital floor.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>maxilla, artificial resorbable material, titanium mesh, preformed
    titanium plates, Gore-Tex sheet, lyophilised dura and cartilage
    have all been used. The repair allows orbital volume to be
    maintained and encourages bony healing to restore the orbital
    defect. Care must be taken to ensure that none of the extraocular
    muscles become trapped in the fracture or under the repair,
    as this would cause even worse diplopia. The <i>forced duction test</i>    is classically described as the test for ensuring this has
    not happened. The surgeon rotates the eye upwards by pulling
    on the inferior rectus muscle to ensure that there is no
    limitation of passive eye movement.</p>
<p>The patient is advised not to blow their nose for a period of
    two to three weeks postoperatively. This reduces the risk
    of surgical emphysema forming in the soft tissues of the
    periorbital and zygomatic region. This is helped by using
    nasal decongestants for the first postoperative week.</p>
<h2>Postoperative care</h2>
<p>Antibiotics are given intravenously during surgery and for two
    postoperative doses if plates are used. Radiographs are taken
    to confirm good reduction of the fractures and satisfactory
    plate and screw positioning, although published audit would
    suggest that these films rarely influence treatment. Topical
    chloramphenicol ointment is applied to skin and conjunctival
    wounds to promote healing and make suture removal easier.
    If necessary, eye exercises are prescribed to encourage mobility
    of the globe. Sutures are removed after five days.</p>
<h2>Indicators of favourable outcome</h2>
<p>Restoration of facial appearance, restoration of eye position
    and function, recovery of infraorbital nerve function, minimal
    scarring, no pain or infection associated with plates (see
    Figure 16).</p>

<h2><strong>Post-Traumatic Orbital Reconstruction – Anatomy</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>‘Safe distances’ (those distances within which it is considered
        safe to dissect within the orbit) have been derived from
        measurements made from intact orbital rims in dried adult
        skulls and are of limited value in cases of severe orbital
        disruption.</li>
    <li>In high-energy injuries, the subperiosteal plane can be difficult
        to identify or be completely absent because of the extent
        of disruption of the orbit. The plane is often absent
        in old injuries, where the surgeon may be attempting
        to correct post-traumatic enophthalmos.</li>
    <li>Despite the accuracy of modern imaging, the size of the defect
        on CT is often smaller than the size of the defect encountered
        at the time of operation.</li>
    <li>The anatomical landmarks of the deep orbit are both hard
        and soft tissue structures:</li>
    <li>Infra-orbital nerve</li>
    <li>The inferior orbital fissure</li>
    <li>The greater wing of the sphenoid</li>
    <li>The orbital plate of the palatine bone.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/treatment/surgery/further-reading"><strong>Orbital fractures in children</strong></a></p>
<p>Blow-out fractures of the orbital floor are rare in children
    under five. The very young are more likely to have a fracture
    of the roof. The investigation of choice is a CT scan. Approaches
    to the facial skeleton may include the subtarsal (lower eyelid)
    approach that gives good access for reconstruction of the
    medial canthal ligament (connects eyelids to the skull) and
    is less likely to damage the lacrimal system. Fractures of
    the roof and supraorbital rim are approached through a coronal
    flap (incision to the scalp, leaving no visible facial scars).
    Access to the frontozygomatic suture in this series is <i>via</i>    a horizontal upper lid blepharoplasty.</p>
<p><strong>Management of orbital blow-out fractures in children:</strong>    fractures of the orbital floor are rare in children under
    8 years old. It is more likely that these fractures would
    involve the anterior orbital floor and be associated with
    diplopia. Classic presentation of an orbital blow-out fracture
    in a child is with no subconjunctival haemorrhage, a ‘white
    eye blow out fracture’ with upgaze diplopia and general malaise
    caused by the oculovagal reflex (caused by pressure or traction
    on the eyeball, see below). There is marked restriction of
    motility in upward and downward gazes and may be little evidence
    of disruption to the orbital floor on CT scans, possibly
    only a small crack or trapdoor defects with little bony displacement.
    The greenstick trapdoor of bone in the orbital floor or medial
    wall in children tends to spring back after fracture and
    trap inferior orbital soft tissues, typically the inferior
    rectus muscle. If not released quickly, it may cause a permanent
    ischaemic necrosis and potentially a Volkmann ischaemic contracture
    and permanent impairment.</p>
<p>The oculovagal reflex presents with bradycardia (slow heart rate)
    associated with traction on the extraocular muscles or compression
    of globe (atropine may be necessary). Refractory vomiting
    is also a feature of the reflex in children and this may
    be uncontrollable until the child is anaesthetized. It is
    worth noting that a less severe set of symptoms can be seen
    in adults with posterior but otherwise similar white eye
    blow-out fractures.</p>
<h1 id="treatment-of-nasal-fractures">Treatment of nasal fractures</h1>
<h2>Aims of treatment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To restore normal anatomy and function</li>
    <li>To correct associated orbital/cranial/ethmoidal (bone at
        root of nose) deformity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Initial treatment</h2>
<p>A septal haematoma must be evacuated by needle aspiration or
    incision as soon as possible after it is identified to prevent
    septal ischaemia and necrosis.</p>
<h2>Plane 1 and 2 injuries</h2>
<p>These are injuries that lie anterior to a line joining the nasal
    bones and the anterior nasal spine and are confined to the
    cartilaginous nasal skeleton (plane 1) or injuries that are
    limited to the external nose, not involving the orbital rims
    (plane 2). These fractures are treated by closed manipulation
    under local or general anaesthesia to reduce the deformity
    (see Figure 17 and Figure 18). Nasal packs and an external
    splint are then placed to hold the nose in position.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 18:</strong> Reducing nasal bones with Walsham’s
        forceps.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A long-standing deformity may require a submucous resection or
    septoplasty (both operations to straighten a deviated septum).
    Complex residual deformity may require post-traumatic rhinoplasty
    (procedure to restore form and function of the nose).</p>
<h2>Plane 3 injuries</h2>
<p>These are fractures <strong>(</strong>nasoethmoid and nasoorbital
    fractures<strong>)</strong> that involve the orbital walls
    and anterior cranium. Fractures involving the nasoethmoidal
    and nasoorbital complex are more demanding. Fractures here
    can lead to loss of nasal projection, widening of the intercanthal
    distance (distance between the eyes), unsightly appearance
    of the nasal bridge, and considerable breathing difficulties.
    If the intercanthal distance is greater than 40mm, open reduction
    and internal fixation of the nasoethmoidal complex is required
    to reattach the medial canthal ligament. This usually means
    fixing the bony attachment of the medial canthus rather than
    the canthus itself, although a specific piece of fixation
    apparatus is available to fix the ligament in rare instances.</p>
<p>Access for this operation is by coronal incision to avoid scarring
    in the forehead region or local lacerations or scars. The
    bones are then elevated with intranasal forceps and fixed
    in place with microplates. Reconstruction of the nasal bridge
    with an <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">autogenous bone graft</a>    may be required. Profuse bleeding can occur perioperatively
    but is controlled by anterior nasal packs placed at the end
    of the procedure.</p>
<h2>Indicators of favourable outcome</h2>
<p>Haemostasis, normal nasal anatomy, acceptable aesthetics, good
    nasal air entry.</p>
<h2>Indicators of unfavourable outcome</h2>
<p>Failure to control haemorrhage, nasal deformity, nasal obstruction,
    patient dissatisfaction.</p>
<h1 id="treatment-of-midface-fractures">Treatment of midface fractures</h1>
<h2>Treatment aims</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Restoration of facial appearance and occlusion</li>
    <li>Stabilisation of fractures to allow healing.</li>
    <li>Reduction of any fractures of the palate</li>
    <li>Prevention of oronasal fistula formation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preoperative consent</h2>
<p>Facial scarring is possible, possible IMF application (fixation
    screws for immobilization), a temporary tracheostomy and/or
    nasal packs may be necessary.</p>
<h2>Midface fracture repair</h2>
<p>Simple undisplaced fractures can be treated conservatively as
    long as there is no derangement of the occlusion or alteration
    of the facial profile.  Complex displaced fractures with
    significant facial and occlusal change require open reduction
    and internal fixation of fracture fragments. All fracture
    repairs are carried out under general anaesthesia with nasal
    intubation ideally. If this is not possible, a temporary
    tracheostomy or a guarded flexible orotracheal tube is used.</p>
<p>The first manoeuvres during fracture repair are disimpaction
    and restoration of the fracture fragments to their premorbid
    position. <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture/detailed">Le Fort I fractures</a>    are treated by simply disimpacting the fracture and then
    closing the patient into their normal occlusion. Once the
    occlusion has been restored, temporary IMF (fixation) is
    applied. An incision in the maxillary buccal mucosa allows
    access to the buttresses and pyriform aperture (pear-shaped
    opening in the skull). The fracture is then exposed and mini
    plates placed. Two plates are normally placed on each side
    to stabilise the fracture; an example is shown in Figure
    19.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed/figure19.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 19:</strong> Postoperative reduced and fixed
        midface fracture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Le Fort II fracture requires buccal sulcus incisions and
    infraorbital incisions and fixation at the level of the infraorbital
    margin as well as the buttress region.</p>
<p>The Le Fort III fracture involves frontozygomatic repair, frontonasal
    fracture repair and zygomatic arch repair.  The latter fracture
    repair is best approached through a coronal incision, which
    gives good access to the zygomatic arch. It is imperative
    that the arch is returned to its pretrauma position, as this
    determines the anteroposterior projection of the face and
    prevents any postoperative facial deformity. The zygomatic
    arch tends to ‘telescope’ under the force of the initial
    impact, thus shortening the anteroposterior facial dimension.</p>
<p><strong>Special Situations:</strong> Le Fort II and III fractures
    often involve disruption of the orbit and orbital floor,
    medial and lateral wall repair is an integral part of the
    operation.</p>
<p>If midface fractures occur in conjunction with complex mandibular
    fractures and condylar fractures, it is imperative that a
    logical sequence of repair is taken.  Mandibular condylar
    height must be restored to ensure the overall <i>posterior facial height</i>    does not change.  Once the condyle is repaired, the frontozygomatic
    suture and zygomatic arch can be repaired, thus setting the
    outer facial frame. The next fracture to approach is the
    lateral orbital wall, maxillary buttress and finally inner
    circle of medial orbital wall and piriform fossa. Adhering
    to this sequence of repair allows achieved logical sequence,
    rational stepwise reduction of the fractures and optimises
    the chances for a return to premorbid position; see Figure
    20 for illustration.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment/surgery/fracture/detailed/figure20.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 20:</strong> Diagram illustrating the rings
        of facial reconstruction.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Postoperative care</h2>
<p>Postoperative analgesia, antibiotics and meticulous oral hygiene
    are required. Condylar height and midfacial position should
    be confirmed on postoperative radiographs. Skin sutures should
    be removed at five days, removal of coronal flap staples
    at seven days. Temporary IMF with elastic bands should be
    placed to reinforce the occlusal position for at least seven
    days. Soft diet is recommended to ensure the plates and the
    reduced fractures do not move. Contact sports should be avoided
    for approximately three months postoperatively.</p>
<h2>Indicators of favourable outcome</h2>
<p>Restoration of occlusion, restoration of facial appearance, restoration
    of eye function, good healing without infection, absence
    of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">palatal fistulae</a>.</p>
<h2>Indicators of unfavourable outcome</h2>
<p>Deranged occlusion, flattened (‘dish face’) appearance, lack
    of nasal projection, persistent diplopia, shortened face,
    infection of plates, exposed palatal bone and development
    of an oro-nasal fistula, hypertelorism (wide eye separation).</p>
<h1 id="treatment-of-frontal-sinus-fractures">Treatment of frontal sinus fractures</h1>
<h2>Treatment aims</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Restoration of forehead continuity and prevention of long-term
        deformity</li>
    <li>Surgical access to assess and repair any dural tear, to prevent
        long term risk of intracranial complications.</li>
    <li>Access to the frontal sinus so that sinus obliteration can
        be carried out and deliberate blockage of the nasofrontal
        duct communication can be undertaken.  This prevents
        long term frontal mucocoele (cyst) and reduces the risk
        of <em>cerebrospinal fluid</em> (CSF) leak through the
        nasal roof.</li>
    <li>If process 3 is not part of the overall treatment plan, for
        example when the posterior wall is intact and there is
        little evidence of frontal sinus lining damage and dysfunction,
        the essential step is to maintain ventilation of the
        sinus by a patent nasofrontal duct. This may require
        intervention ranging from minimal (inhaled nasal decongestants
        for a week) to maximal conservative intervention (functional
        endoscopic sinus surgery).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preoperative consent</h2>
<p>There will be a coronal incision and a small risk of alopecia
    (hair loss) and temporal hollowing (depression near the temple).
    The sense of smell may be further altered. Postoperative
    drains will be present.</p>
<h2>Fracture repair</h2>
<p>Access is <i>via</i> a coronal flap, which exposes the frontal
    bone, orbital roof, medial orbital wall, and nasal bones.
    If the frontal bone is minimally displaced it is reasonable
    to reposition the fragments and fixate by microplating. In
    the case of missing frontal bone the sinus can be directly
    examined for posterior wall fractures, CSF leak and mucosal
    damage. If the frontal bone fragments are displaced but not
    missing, it may be necessary to carry out a mini-craniotomy
    (removal of some bone from the skull) of the frontal bone
    overlying the frontal sinus in order to adequately examine
    the frontal sinus. If the mucosa is significantly damaged,
    one school of thought is that it should be completely excised,
    the frontonasal duct obliterated and the sinus obliterated
    by bone graft. If the posterior sinus wall is involved a
    popular neurosurgical technique is to remove the posterior
    wall, carry out dural repair and allow the brain to expand
    into the defect ‘cranialization’. The most important issue
    is whether the sinus is maintained, in which case it must
    have adequate ventilation via the frontonasal duct as described
    above.</p>
<p>CSF leaks are uncommon and usually resolve without surgical intervention.
    Confirmation requires testing for the presence of beta-2-transferrin
    because glucose levels and the ‘target sign’ or ‘ring test’
    are not reliable. Antibiotics are not recommended, due to
    acquired resistance. Initially leaks are observed for 7-10
    days, followed by CSF direction (lumbar drain) for 5-7 days.
    If repair is required, high-resolution CT scans or intrathecal
    injection (into the spinal canal) of fluorescein (contrast
    agent) are needed to identify the site of leakage.</p>
<p>Repair of the frontal bone defect can be achieved with inner
    table from the cranial vault, fracture fragments, outer table
    bone graft or free iliac bone. If there has been a substantial
    degree of bone loss, acrylic plates were popular as a custom
    made cover for the defect. Alternatively, titanium sheets
    can be used in the acute setting and cut to shape or fabricated
    based on CT scans. Several other cranioplasty materials have
    recently become available (for example, polyarylether-etherketone
    (PEEK)). Long term follow up involves monitoring for frontal
    mucocoele development, meningitis, frontal bone deformity,
    potential infection of the plates and CSF leak.</p>
<h2>Indicators of favourable outcome</h2>
<p>Restoration of anatomy, airway, lacrimal function, eye function,
    no meningitis.</p>
<h2>Indicators of unfavourable outcome</h2>
<p>Facial deformity, telecanthus, eye problems, retention cyst (mucocoele),
    meningitis, loss of sense of smell (anosmia).</p>
