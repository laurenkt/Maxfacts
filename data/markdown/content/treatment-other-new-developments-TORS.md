<h1 id="the-basics-of-robotic-surgery">The basics of robotic surgery</h1>
<p>The motivation underpinning the development of robotic surgery
    approaches, in head &amp; neck surgery as well as in other
    surgical specialties, is straightforward. Where a robotic
    instrument seems well placed to outperform the human hand
    &amp; eye of a top-performing surgeon, a case can be made
    to attempt improvements by means of robotics. Improvements
    could be as varied as reduced operating times, reduced blood
    loss, shorter recovery periods, improved outcome in terms
    of disease-free survival in the surgery of malignant tumours,
    improved quality of life and better functionality after resection
    (and <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>,
    where applicable).</p>
<p>The means to achieve meaningful such results follow some straightforward
    design principles. These design principles are best considered
    as ‘inspired by nature’, a common engineering approach to
    the design of complicated instrumentation.</p>
<p>Any instrumentation / tool that has to be capable to carry out
    complicated manipulations has to take full advantage of the
    degrees of freedom of movement in the three-dimensional world
    (Figure 1).</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The degrees of freedom of translational
        (left) and rotational (right) motion, illustrated by
        Cartesian coordinate systems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clever combination of amplitudes, directions and combinations
    of these types of motions enable every conceivable motion
    in three-dimensional space. The human arm (Figure 2) is well
    designed by nature to provide such degrees of motional freedom
    for the fabulous tool attached to it, the hand. The human
    arm has a great set of joints and suitable dimensions combined
    for this enabling purpose.</p>

        for the human hand.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A robotic arm (Figure 3) typically copies these natural design
    principles to an extent, in order to achieve similar levels
    of dexterity.</p>

        attached to it could be a camera, or a variety of surgical
        tools.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A surgical robot typically is comprised of three robotic arms;
    one arm equipped with a high-definition three-dimensional
    imaging camera, the other two arms carrying surgical instruments.
    The overall surgical set-up has three main components (Figure
    4):</p>
<ul>
    <li>a console for the surgeon to control the robotic arms;</li>
    <li>the robotic devices as such;</li>
    <li>a high-definition, three-dimensional visualisation system.</li>
</ul>

        robotic surgery.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Different degrees of active / passive control of the devices
    during surgery can be implemented, from fully programmed
    robotic operation with little active involvement by the surgeon,
    to the robotic tools being completely controlled by the surgeon,
    and variations between these two extremes.</p>
<p>As far as oral and maxillofacial surgery is concerned, potential
    benefits of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) include</p>
<ul>
    <li>stable three-dimensional, high-resolution vision of the surgical
        site;</li>
    <li>transoral access to otherwise difficult-to-access areas;</li>
    <li>improved preservation of functionalities (swallowing and
        speech);</li>
    <li>reduced morbidities and faster recovery;</li>
    <li>high-precision operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of current TORS approaches include</p>
<ul>
    <li>lack of haptic feedback during surgery, both kinaesthetic
        and tactile;</li>
    <li>cost and non-optimised soft- and hardware for the requirements
        of oral and maxillofacial surgery;</li>
    <li>extensive training needs;</li>
    <li>insufficient evidence base for the advantages and disadvantages
        of TORS for a range of different oral and maxillofacial
        conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-state-of-affairs-for-transoral-robotic-surgery-in-oral-and-maxillofacial-surgery-in-2019">The state of affairs for transoral robotic surgery in oral and
    maxillofacial surgery in 2019</h1>
<p>At the time of writing (2019) transoral robotic surgery (TORS)
    is not a widely established, or fully evaluated surgical
    technique in oral and maxillofacial surgery. However, the
    number of applications is steadily increasing and some (selected)
    potentially beneficial applications for TORS technology seem
    to emerge. It should also be noted that the robotic hard-
    and software used to date was not specifically designed for
    transoral surgery and employs outdated hard- and software
    in general. With the advent of robotic designs more suitable
    for the specific requirements or oral and maxillofacial surgery,
    the evaluation of potentially beneficial applications of
    TORS may shift in the future.</p>
<p>The oropharyngeal region (the region between the soft palate
    and the back of the root of the tongue, and surrounding areas
    and structures) is notoriously difficult to access by conventional
    surgical methods. Slightly restricted access to this area
    may be possible from the neck, or it may be necessary to
    create access by a labiomandibulotomy (Figure 5). This approach
    permits moving the mandible sideways, after splitting lip
    and mandible, to allow open access. Unfortunately, this access
    method is associated with serious morbidities in many cases,
    including <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>,
    impaired speech, <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistulae</a>,
    malocclusion, a range of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/more-info">chronic pain syndromes</a>    and disfigurement, resulting in compromised quality of life.
    It is, therefore, not surprising that surgical interventions
    in the oropharyngeal region have been identified as candidates
    for exploration of transoral robotic surgery as an alternative
    with potential to reduce complications and long-term adverse
    effects of treatment(s). Another potential application of
    TORS methodology in hard-to-reach spaces is gaining access
    to some (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">metastatic</a>)
    lymph nodes in the back of the pharynx, an important aspect
    in the surgery of some oropharyngeal (for example, tonsillar)
    and thyroid malignancies.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-other-new-developments-TORS-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Labiomandibulotomy (splitting
        of the lip and mandible (lower jaw)) allows three-dimensional
        access to posterior tumours, such as oropharyngeal tumours.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These considerations are true irrespective of resections in the
    oropharyngeal space to treat primary tumours, or as salvage
    surgery after recurrence. For large resections, some form
    of robot-assisted <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>    may have its merits too.</p>
<p>Further motivation to develop surgical treatment schemes with
    fewer and less severe morbidities stems from the fact that
    in particular HPV-positive oropharyngeal malignancies tend
    to have excellent prognoses. As these tumours tend to afflict
    younger people, considerations of long-term outcomes, functionalities
    and quality of life issues have become an even more important
    aspect of treatment planning. At the other end of the spectrum,
    with invasive salvage surgery, possible dependency on
    <a href="/help/non-oral-food">tube feeding</a> and/or <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">tracheostomy</a>        in a <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care">palliative setting</a>        with limited life expectancy, maintaining as much quality
        of life for as long as possible is a similarly important
        consideration.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, to date there have been no major randomised controlled
    trials in oral and maxillofacial surgery to compare TORS
    approaches with outcomes achieved by conventional treatment
    protocols; both <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    / <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemoradiotherapy</a>    schemes and open surgery. An increasing body of literature
    is beginning to provide reports on smaller-scale evaluations
    and observations based on consecutive case series with reported
    long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that TORS as the primary treatment
    modality for early stage oropharyngeal malignancies provides
    superior functionality and quality-of-life outcomes in comparison
    with <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> (including
    intensity modulated radiotherapy schemes), with very similar
    oncological results. TORS methodology has been shown to reduce
    the occurrence of positive surgical margins and may be an
    important stepping stone in so called recent ‘de-intensification’
    strategies in the treatment modalities of especially HPV-positive
    oropharyngeal malignancies in non-smokers. The picture becomes
    less clear in treatment protocols where postsurgical adjuvant
    radio- or chemoradiotherapies are necessary. These modalities
    may well negate the potential benefits of TORS in terms of
    fewer treatment-related morbidities. Some retrospective studies
    demonstrate that oncological outcomes and recurrence-free
    survival periods for HPV-positive as well as HPV-negative
    oropharyngeal malignancies following primary TORS treatment
    compares favourably with these results achieved by primary
    radiotherapy. Accelerated postsurgical recovery and shorter
    hospital stays have been reported for TORS. Strangely, however,
    there do not seem to be in-depth studies comparing directly
    the outcomes of TORS and conventional surgical methods, where
    these are the only modalities employed.</p>
<p>In summary, the old and often repeated statement ‘more information
    is needed’ in the conclusions of so many publications definitely
    applies here. TORS has to demonstrate its merits in properly
    designed studies (not necessarily trials, due to small numbers)
    and to live up to the design claims of improved robotic performance
    over that of the human hand &amp; eye. Even for much better
    established robotic surgery approaches in other parts of
    the body, for example in prostate surgery, the evidence in
    favour of robotic surgical methods is not quite as clear
    as is sometimes claimed.</p>
<p>Improved hard- and software to make robotic approaches better
    adapted to manoeuvres in small, dark cavities such as the
    mouth, in the near future may well shift the goal posts as
    far as TORS is concerned. A considerate judgment of the merits
    of TORS also needs to take into accounts the immense costs
    associated, in terms of hardware purchase and hardware maintenance
    as well as in terms of extensive training needs. The latter
    is not a negligible quantity as it includes not only learning
    steps to use hard- and software of any robotic tools, it
    also requires a re-learning of anatomy in an inside =&gt;
    out way, as opposed to the normal outside =&gt; in anatomy
    concept of a surgeon.</p>
