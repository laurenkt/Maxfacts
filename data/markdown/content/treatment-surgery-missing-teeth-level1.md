<p>It may be tempting to expect this section to cover in detail
    the <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">options to remedy</a>    the loss of teeth from <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/damage">trauma</a>,
    <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>    or <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">tooth decay</a>. However,
    treatment to deal with loss of teeth will not be covered
    here (or elsewhere on our website) – these are themes that
    firmly belong, and are dealt with, in the field of dentistry
    rather than oral &amp; maxillofacial surgery.</p>
<p>Here we briefly sketch treatment options for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/missing-teeth">missing permanent teeth from developmental abnormalities</a>.
    Missing primary (baby) teeth do not require any treatment.</p>
<p>Anodontia, the rare congenital complete absence of teeth, will
    most likely require some form of prosthetics (such as dentures
    or <a href="/treatments/surgery/implants">implants</a>, for
    functional as well as aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>Hypodontia, the congenital absence of one or some teeth without
    further systemic conditions, may either require no treatment
    or some corrective interventions or prosthetics, depending
    on the individual situation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The most commonly <strong>missing third molar</strong> -
        no treatment required.</li>
    <li><strong>Missing second premolar or lateral incisor</strong>        – treatment depends on the degree of crowding in the
        jaw, on functionality and misalignment (malocclusion)
        and aesthetic requirements. A small gap caused by the
        missing tooth may be dealt with by orthodontic correction
        aiming to simply close the gap. Alternatively, orthodontics
        may aim to increase the gap such that later placement
        of a crown or bridge (implant supported, or otherwise)
        will become possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Treatment options for hypodontia associated with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/craniofacial-anomalies">craniofacial syndromes</a>    from genetic disorders such as Crouzon syndrome are secondary
    to any <a href="/treatment/surgery/craniofacial-anomalies">corrective surgical interventions</a>    addressing anatomical problems arising from the genetic disorder.</p>
