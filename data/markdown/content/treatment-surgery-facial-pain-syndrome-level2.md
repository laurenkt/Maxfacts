<p>Given that many facial pain conditions belong to the category
    of idiopathic (unknown cause) pain, it will not come as a
    surprise that various attempts to treat some of these chronic
    pain conditions may include an element of trial and error.
    Fortunately, even if highly unpleasant and immensely irritating,
    most of these conditions do not represent life-threatening
    circumstances and thus there is room to try different options
    – and hope for the best along the way.</p>
<h1 id="idiopathic-/-atypical-facial-pain">Idiopathic / atypical facial pain</h1>
<p>Often the ill-defined nature of idiopathic / atypical facial
    pain will have resulted in unnecessary dental work. The treatment
    / management of the condition is aiming to control the pain,
    usually by use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication">medication</a>.</p>
<p>In light of the association of atypical facial pain with neuroses,
    particularly depression, and the possibility of a psychogenic
    basis, emphasis has been placed on the use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">antidepressant therapeutic agents</a>    as the main analgesic medication option. Some tricyclic antidepressants
    have been shown to be effective in reducing painful symptoms
    in doses far below those used in depression. Another option
    can be the analgesic agent pregabalin, which is used to treat
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">neuropathic pain</a>    and convulsions (seizures) and has a secondary effect in
    reducing anxiety.</p>
<h1 id="trigeminal-neuralgia">Trigeminal neuralgia</h1>
<p>Usually, trigeminal neuralgia responds well to the drug <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain">carbamazepine</a>    (used to treat epilepsy, diabetic neuropathy and neuropathic
    pain). Other drugs known to have an effect include the analgesics
    gabapentin or pregabalin, the antidepressant amitriptyline
    and a muscle relaxant such as baclofen.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine is usually the drug of choice with approximately
    70 % of patients reporting significant relief. Side effects
    include drowsiness, confusion, vertigo, nausea, vomiting,
    aplastic anaemia, and liver failure. The lowest dose required
    to control the pain, and regular monitoring of liver function
    and blood plasma are in order. It is also advisable to withdraw
    this kind of medication slowly to prevent acute psychosis
    associated with abrupt withdrawal. Despite this apparent
    array of unwanted effects for most patients with trigeminal
    neuralgia this drug is a godsend.</p>
<p>If medical therapy fails to bring about relief of pain, invasive
    techniques such as <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">cryotherapy</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia">peripheral nerve blocks</a>,
    <a href="/treatment/other/extreme-temperatures">percutaneous destruction of the trigeminal ganglion</a>    may be indicated.</p>
<p>Open neurosurgical procedures such as microvascular decompression
    of the root of the trigeminal nerve are an excellent option
    where it has been demonstrated that a microvascular loop
    compresses the trigeminal nerve root; these cases are comparatively
    rare.</p>
