<p>Bone necrosis (osteonecrosis) in the head &amp; neck
    region often occurs in combination with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">necrosis of
        adjacent soft tissues</a> such as the skin or the
    lining of the mouth (mucosa). More information about
    this additional aspect of bone necrosis is on our pages
    about <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">diagnosis</a>
    and <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/soft-tissue">treatment
        of soft tissue necrosis</a> .</p>
<h1 id="some-general-remarks">Some general remarks</h1>
<p>Having briefly outlined medical and surgical treatment
    options for the <a href="/treatment/surgery/necrosis/hard-tissue">management
        of osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ)</a> on the
    previous page, below we discuss these options in more
    detail. Any considerations about suitable, or less
    appropriate, treatment schemes for individual
    circumstances are closely linked to the different causes
    and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">hypotheses
        about the pathology of ONJ</a> , be it necrosis
    caused by previous <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy
        treatment</a> (osteoradionecrosis, ORN), by
    medications that interfere with the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">bone
        remodelling process</a> (medication-related
    osteonecrosis of the jaws, MRONJ), such as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>
    or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/denusomab">denusomab</a>,
    or other less common causes. However, in addition to
    such bone-pathophysiology focussed considerations there
    are many more aspects to take into account when choosing
    the individually most suitable treatment option(s) for
    ONJ.</p>
<p>Of the less common, but varied causes, of ONJ the most
    prominent ones are a range of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>.
    According to some recent microbiological studies, even
    latent and persistent <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal
        disease</a>, together with other trigger events, may
    be a significant enabling factor for the development of
    ONJ. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">Treatment
        of these underlying causes</a> combined with local
    débridement is normally also curative for the resulting
    ONJ. Broadly, this is true for most, if not all, cases
    of ONJ that are not related to either <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> or
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive
        medications</a>. In many of these cases the
    treatment of the underlying conditions, such as diabetes
    is not within the remit of maxillofacial surgery, so
    will not be discussed further here.</p>
<p>The situation is different for the two main causes of
    ONJ, <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>
    or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive
        medications</a>. There, the causes cannot be
    eliminated and treatment is aimed at managing the
    sometimes severe, consequences. Our discussion below
    addresses management needs of these two forms of ONJ.
</p>
<p>ONJ caused by either of these two causes can occur in
    milder forms, more severe variations, and debilitating
    very severe forms. The underlying medical conditions
    that lead to radiotherapy treatment to the head and neck
    region (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">malignancies in
        the head and neck region</a>), or long-term
    treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive
        medications</a> (most commonly to manage severe
    osteoporosis, but also in the management of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">bone
        metastases</a>) in the first place are very
    different. This accounts for normally very different
    life situations and/or prognoses. Accordingly, similar
    extents of ONJ may call for different treatment
    modalities for the two causative factors and different
    life situations (see below).</p>
<p>As a general trend, milder forms of ONJ may be managed
    successfully with medical options and/or minor surgical
    interventions. More severe forms typically require more
    invasive surgical <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">resection
        &amp; reconstruction</a>. There is no
    one-size-fits-all approach to the individually
    appropriate management of ONJ. Further, there are only a
    few firmly established facts and many myths, ambiguity,
    biased and poorly evidence-supported reports in the
    literature, about the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">pathophysiology
        of the condition</a> as well as treatment modalities
    and protocols.</p>
<p>In very general terms, the greatest obstacle to effective
    treatment of all forms of osteonecrosis is the lack of
    understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions.
    Accordingly, there are no clear ‘gold standard’
    treatment recommendations, but there is ongoing debate
    about current treatment strategies.</p>
<h1 id="non-surgical-treatment-options">Non-surgical treatment options</h1>
<p>In most cases, clinical findings are that all forms of
    ONJ, including milder forms, are accompanied by some
    form of lesion and/or necrosis and/or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a> of
    adjacent soft tissues, in particular the oral mucosa
    (parallels with osteonecrosis of the external auditory
    canal have been pointed out – a similar situation where
    bone is only separated by a thin layer from a heavily
    bacterially colonised area). With this fact in
    mind<strong>, classical and well-established management
        methods</strong> make good sense. Rigorous <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a> regimens,
    including ‘tricks’ for optimised self-care, and
    including <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a>
    antibacterial mouthwash and/or irrigation of small
    exposed areas of bone and meticulous local wound care
    are essential. It has also been pointed out that more
    can be done to avoid the development of ONJ. Before
    starting therapy with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive</a>
    or <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiangiogenic">antiangiogenic</a>
    drugs or <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>,
    careful <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-pretreatment">examination
        of the dental status</a> (including prosthetics
    and/or <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">implants</a>)
    followed by all necessary dental treatments, and
    optimised oral hygiene as a starting point can be useful
    prevention strategies. This proactive strategy makes
    good sense in the light of recent experimental findings
    that existing <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal">periodontal
        disease</a> may be a factor in the development of
    ONJ, possibly in a synergistic mode in combination with
    other infections or lesions developing later.</p>
<p>In addition, taking determined action as early as
    possible is the best chance to avoid (or delay)
    progression of ONJ from milder to more severe forms. In
    many cases, this will include a course of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">systemic
        antibacterial and/or antifungal agents</a> to
    control local infections. Infections in areas afflicted
    by ONJ are typically caused by a range of bacteria that
    are commonly involved in dental infections, and are
    usually sensitive to treatment with standard <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial
        agents</a> such as penicillin, amoxicillin,
    clindamycin or metronidazole. Sometimes it is useful or
    necessary to obtain more precise <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">microbiological
        characterisation</a> of the infectious species and
    change antibacterial and/or antifungal agents to more
    targeted choices. The duration of systemic antibacterial
    / antifungal treatment courses may vary considerably. <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">Anti-inflammatory
        agents</a> such as <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-steroid">corticosteroids</a>
    in combination with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesia</a>
    may be helpful during acute episodes.</p>
<p>This type of management leads to a resolution and healing
    of small ONJ lesions in most cases, time and
    perseverance permitted, and irrespective of the lesion
    being caused by radiotherapy or by antiresorptive
    medications.</p>
<p>An alternative medical treatment scheme for the
    management of ORN was suggested some time ago. The
    medication scheme is known as <strong>PENTOCLO, or
        triple therapy</strong>. The drug cocktail is based
    on the hypothesis that fibrosis (scar formation) and
    atrophy (tissue wasting) are the two main effects of
    long-term damage to <i>soft</i> tissue by high-energy
    radiation. Significantly, this hypothesis of explaining
    the pathophysiology of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/soft">soft-tissue
        necrosis</a> resulting from radiotherapy (in the
    treatment of breast cancers) does not actively consider
    infection(s) and does not take the particular conditions
    of the oral cavity into account, nor does it address
    differences in the pathophysiology of hard and soft
    tissues in their response to high-energy radiation
    damage.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the suggested medication scheme derived
    from the fibrosis/atrophy hypothesis was adopted
    seamlessly for the medical treatment of ORN and later
    its use was even extended to include MRONJ. The scheme
    consists of three drugs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/pentoxifylline">pentoxifylline</a>
        , assumed to have anti-inflammatory properties;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/tocopherol">tocopherol</a>
        , assumed to act as an antioxidant;</li>
    <li><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/clodronate">clodronate</a>
        , an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive
            agent</a> from the group of <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-bisphophonates">bisphosphonates</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>To date, there are no controlled studies of the efficacy
    of the scheme in the treatment of ORN, despite a number
    of publications claiming success. Most of these reports
    are on small groups of patients. Neither is there any
    substantive and convincing explanation of the exact
    working mechanisms of this drug cocktail, or even two of
    its components although there is plenty of speculation.
    On closer inspection, most of the publications originate
    from few groups, including the group who originally
    suggested the scheme for the management of soft tissue
    necrosis following radiotherapy in treatment for breast
    cancer. Most treatments reported as successful were
    achieved on small ORN lesions (which can also be
    successfully treated in more conventional ways; see
    above). PENTOCLO was used in several studies in
    conjunction with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial
        agents</a> and/or <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-steroid">steroids</a>,
    so any treatment success may just as well be attributed
    to these agents. In the reality of clinical practice,
    the PENTOCLO regimen is commonly five drugs, the regimen
    adding an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial
        agent</a>, ciprofloxacin and a <a href="/treatment-other-medication-miscellaneous-steroid">steroid</a>,
    usually prednisolone.</p>
<p>It seems at least counterintuitive to use a drug cocktail
    in which one component, clodronate, belongs to a group
    of antiresorptive medicinal drugs, <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>,
    known to be associated with <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">medication-related
        osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ)</a>. Schemes using
    a combination of pentoxifylline and tocopherol have also
    been used in the management of MRONJ, omitting
    clodronate from the cocktail.</p>
<p>The use of PENTOCLO medication schemes is controversial.
    In the light of the limited information available, in
    the UK the NICE (National Institute of Clinical
    Excellence) recommendation is to use these medication
    schemes only as part of a clinical trial, but not
    otherwise. There is a clear need for more rigorous
    investigations into this type of medical treatment
    scheme and its potential merits for the treatment of ORN
    and MRONJ.</p>
<p>This should include a step back to the basics, that is
    back to the laboratory to properly unravel the
    pathophysiology of ORN and MRONJ, alongside laboratory
    studies of the interaction mechanisms of the various
    medical agents with the physiology and pathophysiologies
    of bone. Of course, when we say ‘bone’ this is no more
    than an umbrella term for different types of bone, and
    of non-uniform properties of different types of bone in
    different parts of the skeleton, even just over the
    small area of the jaw bones, and necrosis associated
    with different causes.</p>
<h1 id="surgical-interventions">Surgical interventions</h1>
<p>In the same way as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), covers
    a wide range of severity from minor (and often
    non-symptomatic) lesions all the way to debilitating
    forms, there are variable degrees of invasiveness of
    surgical interventions to deal with ONJ.</p>
<p>There is mounting evidence that surgical intervention as
    the first-line treatment modality, whenever possible,
    has the best chances of success for resolving ONJ
    lesions at all degrees of severity. There are also
    indications that extensive surgery provides results
    superior to those of conservative surgical or
    non-surgical (see above) interventions. Increasing
    evidence suggests that the better success of
    sufficiently radical surgical interventions is likely to
    be related to the prolonged and often failing healing of
    these lesions under other treatment schemes. This
    failure, in turn, has been ascribed to the presence of
    necrotic and / or infected bone itself preventing
    recovery of the adjacent mucosa and subsequent healing
    of the affected site. Non-surgical treatment options can
    provide symptom relief, but closure of mucosal lesion(s)
    remains challenging in this way. If healing using
    conservative methods fails, then surgical intervention
    is the only option.</p>
<p>Minor, superficial surgical débridement to remove
    necrotic bone in some circumstances (Figure 1) may be an
    appropriate minimal intervention. Its success relies on
    the ability to achieve a ‘watertight’ seal by means of
    antiseptic packs, mucosa or other vascularised soft
    tissue. Without seal, complete mucosal healing is
    unlikely.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-necrosis-hard-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Before (top) and
        after (bottom) débridement of a minor ORN lesion.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>More extensive forms of ONJ require more extensive
    surgical strategies. These include removal of all
    necrotic bone (sequestrectomy), smoothing of bone edges,
    decortication (Figure 2). In some such cases, primary
    wound closure may still be possible. With increasing
    defects, it is more likely that vascularised local soft
    tissue will be needed to provide a <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer/facial-skin-cancer/more-info">local
        flap</a> for an effective seal. Other possibilities
    for wound closure are <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">regional or
        free soft-tissue flaps</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-necrosis-hard-level3-figure2.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Débridement
        followed by coverage with local vascularised tissue.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Extended ONJ lesions, most commonly affecting the
    mandible, require extensive resections where <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstruction</a>
    of the resection defect by hard and / or soft tissue
    microvascular free flaps is necessary, especially ORN
    lesions (Figure 3).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-necrosis-hard-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> ORN lesion,
        repaired by resection and reconstruction with a free
        fibula flap. Top: intraoral view; bottom: view of
        the neck, demonstrating the residual skin damage.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reconstruction of extended MRONJ lesions can be
    predominantly guided by the repair aspects of the bony
    defect, because MRONJ tends to affect the adjacent soft
    tissues to a lesser degree than ORN does. Accordingly, a
    single free flap chosen to cover hard and soft tissue
    defects will typically be the appropriate surgical
    strategy (Figure 4).</p>
<figure><img src="/treatment-surgery-necrosis-hard-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> MRONJ lesion of
        the upper jaw. Top: the maxillary lesion; middle:
        local debridement; bottom: local advancement flap to
        close the defect. This would not work with ORN as
        the local soft tissue would have a high risk of
        necrosis.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reconstruction for ORN may require a combination of two
    different flaps. This is because the residual
    surrounding soft tissue contains large numbers of cells
    which have also sustained high-energy radiation damage
    and when they attempt to heal after surgery, they
    essentially necrose. This means that the invisible soft
    tissue future defect must be catered for in treatment
    planning for ORN. There is no benefit in having a
    reconstructed lining of the mouth and jaw with a (for
    example) free fibula flap if the skin coverage then
    dies. This can appear overly dramatic, but a single,
    large two-flap operation is often the only way to create
    a safe healing environment (Figure 4, Figure 5).</p>

        multi-site and multi-tissue defect; bottom right:
        result at 6 months after surgery.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A typical combination of hard and soft tissue flaps are,
    a <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/more-info">fibula
        flap</a> to repair the hard tissue defect, plus a
    variety of options of soft tissue free flaps (for
    example, from the thigh or forearm) to address soft
    tissue defects. The approach increases the complexity of
    the surgery but can deliver optimal aesthetic and
    functional results.</p>
<p>Subsequent improvements of quality of life have been
    reported when ORN / MRONJ are treated with free flap
    mandibular reconstruction. Even in the presence of
    significant peripheral vascular disease, free flap
    reconstruction can be an option, including <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-post-treatment">dental
        rehabilitation</a>. In some situations, major
    surgical intervention may be the best option even with
    <a href="/treatment/timelines/palliative-care/more-info">palliative
        intent</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some patients may be <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/immunosuppressants">immunosuppressed</a>
    or suffer from carcinomatosis (widespread metastases),
    both leading to prolonged and complicated wound healing,
    enhanced risk of flap failure, or even relapse of
    osteonecrosis. Also, peri-operative use of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibacterial
        agents</a> needs to consider carefully any possible
    systemic impact of such medications, depending on the
    underlying condition(s) and / or other ongoing
    treatment(s).</p>
<p>Obviously, there is no straightforward treatment protocol
    for ONJ that would be suitable for all situations.
    Decisions about the best possible treatment options are
    a complex balancing act and need to include an
    individual’s prognosis, lifestyle and life
    circumstances, needs, desires – and the reality of what
    can be achieved. Below we look a little closer into
    these aspects.</p>
<h1 id="choice-of-treatment-options">Choice of treatment option(s)</h1>
<p>The group of people at risk of, or suffering from, ORN or
    MRONJ are a heterogeneous group – as they suffer(ed)
    from very different underlying conditions in the first
    place. Optimal treatment choices for ORN / MRONJ thus
    cannot be considered meaningfully as separate entities
    from the overall condition and situation of an
    individual. It bears a certain aspect of tragedy that
    ORN / MRONJ usually are simply adverse effects of
    otherwise often successful treatment of head &amp; neck
    malignancies or osteoporosis (of different degrees of
    severity). This is especially so because in many such
    cases the impact of severe ONJ and its treatment far
    exceed the impact any previous treatment for the
    original condition(s) may have had. It has to be said,
    though, that in the majority of cases the overall risk –
    benefit analysis tends to be in favour of treatment for
    osteoporosis or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">bone
        metastases</a> with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive
        agents</a>. Of course, choosing to have <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> as a
    sole or adjunct treatment modality for head &amp; neck
    malignancy is also an individual decision, but is likely
    to have fewer viable alternatives and will come with a
    higher sense of urgency.</p>
<p>In order to strike the right balance between over- and
    undertreatment of ONJ, roughly two categories of
    considerations play a role. There are ‘technical’
    aspects (such as differences between ORN and MRONJ
    conditions), and equally importantly there are ‘whole
    system’ / individual considerations of life situation
    and preferences.</p>
<p>A short summary of clinical and pathological, ‘technical’
    considerations with impact on treatment decisions
    includes</p>
<ul>
    <li>presence of bone metastases and / or other ongoing
        malignancy definitely qualifies risk-reduction by
        prevention before and during malignancy treatment as
        the best option, sometimes the only option;</li>
    <li>clinically, pathological <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fracture">fractures</a>,
        skin <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/fistula">fistulae</a>
        and <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> are
        more frequent with ORN, whereas dental extractions
        (which could be planned for before starting
        treatment and be avoided once treatment has started)
        are a more relevant factor in MRONJ;</li>
    <li>osteolysis (dissolution of bone) is predominant in
        ORN, osteosclerosis (hardening and densification of
        bone) in MRONJ;</li>
    <li>pathologically, MRONJ generally disrupts the bone
        architecture and organisation; ORN leads to
        increased fibrosis of the bone tissue;</li>
    <li>pathologically, ORN lesions are more homogeneous in
        their structures with more extensive necrosis and
        affect the most dense bone structures most seriously
        (the absorption rate of high-energy radiation is
        higher the denser the irradiated material is);</li>
    <li>pathologically, MRONJ lesions tend to be more patchy
        and affect often cancellous bone structures (as
        antiresorptive agents are incorporated into bone
        structures all over the body, with higher deposits
        into well vascularised bone structures; Figure 7);

<p>As the understanding of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/necrosis/hard/detailed">physiology
        and pathophysiology of bone remodelling</a>, and of
    the exact effects of high-energy radiation and of <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive
        agents</a> will continue to improve and grow, so
    will the list above.</p>
<p>Beyond technical aspects, the decision-finding process of
    filtering out the individually best treatment option(s)
    includes a multitude of individual aspects.</p>
<p>Irrespective of all these other considerations, if
    someone’s life expectancy and condition are poor, the
    main aim of any treatment has to be best possible
    symptom relief with the least invasive approach.</p>
<p>Most, but by no means all, people suffering from head
    &amp; neck malignancies and subsequently having
    developed ORN following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>,
    tend to be elderly. Although this is still numerically
    true at the time of writing (2019), the age changes
    which have come with HPV-driven <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">oropharyngeal
        squamous cell carcinoma</a> affecting younger
    people, means this generalisation applies less now than
    it did 5 to 10 years ago.</p>
<p>With a good prognosis, the preferences of somebody young
    for treatment of ORN may be rather different from those
    of somebody at more advanced age. In addition, younger
    people are more likely to be fit for major surgery. This
    should not be misread as an ageist statement, far from
    it; it is simply a matter of fact that the life
    situation of somebody say, at the beginning of a
    professional career is profoundly different from
    somebody else’s who may have been retired for 20 years.
    The distinction here really is not age as such, but the
    accompanying individual circumstances and life
    situations and how these may favour certain treatment
    options over others. Some people, almost independent of
    age and life situation, may also have reached a point of
    distinct ‘treatment fatigue’ from their previous
    condition(s). Individuals’ expectations about
    functionality and aesthetic improvements vary widely; it
    is important to keep a sense of realistic expectations.
    Part of this expectation management is a good
    understanding of what can be achieved, which quality of
    life impairments are caused by ORN and which are a
    result of, for example major previous surgery and hence
    will remain.  </p>
<p>The situation for those afflicted by MRONJ is basically a
    tale of two worlds. There are those who suffer from
    osteoporosis of variable degrees of severity, are
    otherwise relatively fit and have no other major
    co-morbidities, and are on long-term treatment with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonates</a>,
    and some unfortunate invasive dental treatment, such as
    a tooth extraction, triggered the development of MRONJ.
    This is likely to be a group of people with relatively
    good prognoses and life expectancies, factors which will
    impact individual decisions regarding willingness to
    undergo major surgical interventions (see above). The
    life situation is quite different if somebody suffers
    from severe osteoporosis, is very frail and possibly has
    other morbidities, making a decision in favour of major
    surgery for MRONJ treatment less likely.</p>
<p>And there are those on treatment with a range of
    antiresorptive medications in order to manage and
    mitigate the effects of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/metastases">bone
        metastases</a>. In many such circumstances major
    surgery may not by the first choice, and alternative
    local tissue coverage after débridement of necrotic bone
    may be more suitable than <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">microvascular
        free-flap reconstruction</a>, but there will be rare
    cases where major surgery with palliative intent is the
    best option. Life expectancy, overall fitness and
    quality of life are likely to be the most important
    considerations here.</p>
<h1 id="prevention-strategies-and-adjunctive-treatments">Prevention strategies and adjunctive treatments</h1>
<h2>Prevention strategies</h2>
<p>As far as ORN is concerned, better appreciation of the
    extent and seriousness of the condition by those who
    deliver radiotherapy may be a good step in the right
    direction. Improved appreciation would hopefully remove
    a major obstacle to prevention by motivating improved
    delivery protocols to minimise ORN risks at this stage.
    The role of a specialist in <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative
        dentistry</a> as part of the multidisciplinary
    treatment team has been well established in most
    developed countries. The crux of the problem at the
    prevention stage is predicting the longevity of a
    dentition in any individual who may undergo
    radiotherapy. It is vital to avoid a sense of nihilism
    (remove all suspect teeth prior to radiotherapy – this
    may decrease the local incidence of ORN but is hardly in
    keeping with improving quality of life). Equally the
    ‘take a chance on healing’ approach inducted into most
    modern dentists is completely inappropriate in this
    instance. It really does require a specialist with
    experience in this area.</p>
<p>For all types of ONJ, ORN as well as MRONJ, awareness of
    risks and prevention strategies by dentists and patients
    is of prime importance. This includes knowledge of signs
    &amp; symptoms so that at least any emerging problems
    can be addressed promptly / early. The ‘prevention by
    knowledge’ strategy extends to those clinicians who
    prescribe <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/antiresorptive">antiresorptive
        medications</a>, they need to fully explain the
    long-term risks associated with these medications.</p>
<p>‘Drug holidays’ have been proposed for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/bisphosphonates">bisphosphonate</a>
    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/denusomab">denusomab</a>
    antiresorptives when invasive dental treatment is
    planned in order to minimise MRONJ risks. This may be a
    useful option for <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/denusomab">denusomab</a>,
    which is usually eliminated from the body approximately
    6 months after cessation of treatment. In the light of
    the very long persistence of bisphosphonates in bone (up
    to 15 years), common sense suggests that a short
    interruption of taking these drugs does not make sense.
    There is no hard evidence about the potential benefits
    of ‘drug holidays’ for bisphosphonates. It also needs to
    be kept in mind that a balanced decision has to be made
    about the overall risks and benefits of interrupting
    this kind of long-term medication.</p>
<p>Self-help is a powerful ally in the life-long prevention
    of developing ONJ. It goes without saying, meticulous
    daily <a href="/help/oral-hygiene">oral hygiene</a> is a
    crucial prevention approach (also with respect to <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry
        mouth)</a> problems following radiotherapy applied
    to the head &amp; neck region, and keeping in mind the
    potential role of <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal
        disease</a> as one of the contributing factors in
    the development of ONJ). Regular visits to the dentist
    and the help of a dental hygienist are included,
    accepting a little help to help oneself.</p>
<p>Avoiding any potential irritants that may trigger ONJ by
    hurting the oral mucosa is a lifelong task for those at
    risk of ORN, and at least a long-term consideration for
    those at risk of MRONJ. Such irritants range from
    toothbrushes with sharp bristles (use ultrasoft
    toothbrushes instead), to hard foods (classical examples
    being crisps or crispbread; if in doubt – do not eat
    it), to ever so slightly <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/cancer-pretreatment">ill-fitting
        dentures</a>. The lifelong risk of injury to the
    oral mucosa is particularly high after radiotherapy,
    which leaves the mucosa permanently vulnerable.</p>
<p>Any of the mentioned self-care actions are well worth the
    effort if they can help to avoid ONJ, or at least slow
    down the progression of the condition.</p>
<h2>Adjunct treatments</h2>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/hyperbaric-oxygen"><strong>Hyperbaric
            oxygen (HBO)</strong></a> <strong>treatment
        schemes</strong> have long been advocated by some as
    an adjunct option for the treatment for ORN, or as a
    preventative measure to avoid the development of ORN
    after invasive dental treatments, following radiotherapy
    to the head and neck region. There has never been
    convincing evidence for the efficacy of the approach and
    finally, the <a href="/treatment/other/further-reading">HOPON
        trial</a> has demonstrated that the approach is
    useless. Fortunately, the trial also showed that (as one
    might have reasons to fear, given the <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/principles/detailed">cell-toxicity
        of free radicals</a>) that at least HBO does not
    trigger or drive recurrence of malignancy.</p>
<p>In some sense, also the PENTOCLO medication scheme (see
    above) may be seen, and has been used, as an adjunct
    treatment option. There are no randomised prospective
    clinical trials, NICE has recommended its use only as
    part of clinical trials and frankly, the rationale for
    use has serious limitations. The desperation of both
    patients and clinicians in wishing to avoid or treat
    both forms of jaw necrosis perhaps explains some of the
    wishful thinking that seems to drive these approaches.
