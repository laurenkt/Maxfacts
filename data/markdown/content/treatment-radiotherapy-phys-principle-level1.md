<p>Our pages about the <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy/application">clinical application of radiotherapy</a>    in the treatment of head and neck cancers discuss a fair
    amount of relevant technical and physical details. Without
    including these details in that discussion it would be very
    difficult to explain some of the clinical applications and
    procedures.</p>
<p>The term radiotherapy does not really specify what is being done,
    it merely says that some form of radiation is applied to
    living tissues with the intent to cure or improve disease
    â€“ almost always a malignancy.</p>
<p>Here we take a step back from the practicalities and put into
    context how a force with enormously destructive potential
    works in principle and how this can be turned to good use.
    In order for radiation to be able to destroy malignant cells,
    the applied radiation has to have high enough energy to cause
    lasting and irreversible damage to cells. At the same time
    it is necessary to protect healthy tissue as much as possible
    from bio-damage caused by exposure to high-energy irradiation.
    Photons, electrons and protons are most commonly used to
    create high-energy radiation but some heavier ions as well
    as neutrons can also be used. These different sources of
    high-energy radiation have different properties (with different
    strengths and weaknesses) and have all been explored to deliver
    high-energy irradiation in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>Photons with energies in the X-ray region are the most commonly
    used source of radiation but also photons with even higher
    energies (gamma rays), usually resulting from radioactive
    decay processes or generated in an accelerator, are used
    for therapeutic purposes. A whole range of different technical
    schemes to deliver X-ray radiation selectively to a target
    area / tumour volume while sparing nearby healthy tissues
    as much as possible have been developed, and continue to
    be further developed. This includes methods such as implanting
    a small source of radioactive radiation into, or very near
    to, a tumour (brachytherapy) or more commonly some modulated,
    multi-beam schemes of irradiation by an external source (for
    example, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)).</p>
<p>Damage to cells by high-energy radiation depends on the type
    of radiation source, on the overall dosage received as well
    as on the type of tumour. It is extremely rare to deliver
    the full dose in a single session. Accordingly, case-dependent
    time- and dosage-schemes are worked out individually.</p>
<p>The relationship between high-energy radiation and living cells,
    healthy and malignant ones alike, is a complicated one. It
    would certainly be wrong to reduce the discussion to a merely
    mechanical picture with simple cause / effect relationships,
    omitting a multitude of biological and biochemical issues
    and considerations.</p>
