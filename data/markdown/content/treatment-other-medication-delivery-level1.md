<p>When it comes to controlled and targeted delivery of medication
    to the body, essentially three main aspects need to be taken
    into consideration: the delivery method, the timings, and
    possible interferences.</p>
<p>Medicinal drugs are designed to be taken at a fixed dose at a
    fixed time, so as to keep the concentration of the drug in
    the body at an ideal level. If the concentration goes too
    low then there will not be enough to produce the desired
    therapeutic effect. If the concentration goes too high then
    the drug will start to cause adverse effects. Depending on
    the method of delivery the time taken between the administration
    of the drug and its response will vary.</p>
<p>There are various delivery methods of drugs, ranging from common
    methods such injections or tablets to less common methods
    such as absorption through skin or mucosa, each having their
    own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of delivery
    method depends on the individual patient and drug that is
    being administered. The desired effect and site of activity
    also dictates which method is best used, for example if a
    drug needs to be fast acting or if prolonged action is required.</p>
<p>There are many potential interferences with medication: food
    and drink, other medications (including over-the-counter
    ones), patient-specific interactions can all effect how a
    medicinal drug works in a particular instance for a particular
    person. There may be reasons attributable to our genetics
    that some interactions occur, such as those that cause allergic
    reactions. Drug interferences can alter the way our bodies
    absorb and process medications. However, not all interactions
    are bad and some can improve drug effectiveness so it is
    important to understand the effects any interactions may
    have on the working of a drug and consequently on the body.</p>
