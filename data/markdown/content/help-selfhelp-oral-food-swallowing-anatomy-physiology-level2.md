<p>Swallowing is one of our bodies’ functions that we rarely pay
    attention to, we take it for granted – until something goes
    wrong. Swallowing is a complicated process involving a large
    number of feedback loops, including voluntary and involuntary
    steps in the process. Several areas of the brain have been
    identified as ‘control centres’ for regulating the swallowing
    process. Under normal circumstances we swallow about 500
    to 2000 times daily, swallowing requires the concerted actions
    of about 50 pairs of muscles and 5 main cranial nerves (nerves
    in the skull). It will not come as a surprise that it takes
    only a little disturbance of this complicated system to produce
    problems of some sort with swallowing (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>).</p>
<aside>
    <p>Detailed information about nerves and muscles involved in
        swallowing is in our section about <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">head and neck anatomy</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>An understanding of the swallowing process when everything functions
    as it should is helpful (we believe) for understanding the
    various ways in which swallowing can be compromised and the
    ways in which such difficulties can be either circumvented
    or at least much reduced in many cases.</p>
<p>Here we sketch</p>
<ul>
    <li>the normal course of events in the swallowing process (for
        solid and liquid foods);</li>
    <li>how our bodies actually acquire the ability to swallow safely
        (starting with the foetus up to the age of around two
        years).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-normal-swallowing-process">The normal swallowing process</h1>
<p>The swallowing process is best described as a series of phases.
    These phases are different for liquid and solid / semi-solid
    foods (liquids are rapidly and directly transferred from
    the oral cavity to the oesophagus (gullet)). For solid /
    semi-solid foods the location of the bolus (lump of solid
    / semi-solid food) roughly defines the phases of the swallowing
    process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pre-oral (anticipatory) phase</li>
    <li>oral preparation phase</li>
    <li>oral phase</li>
    <li>pharyngeal phase (throat)</li>
    <li>oesophageal phase (gullet)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The anticipatory, pre-oral phase</strong> precedes the
    opening of the mouth, before putting food in the mouth. At
    this initial stage the food is checked (look, smell, temperature,
    consistency) for suitability; this check has voluntary and
    involuntary components. The final step of this phase is the
    sensory input from the lips from touching the food, before
    accepting or rejecting it.</p>
<p><strong>The oral preparation phase</strong> continues the careful
    examination of the food that has now been put in the mouth
    (smell, taste, temperature and volume). This stage is largely
    ‘automated’ but is under voluntary control: if the food fails
    the examination, it can be spit out at this stage. If the
    food passes the examination, at this stage some early alert
    for the swallowing reflex is initiated.</p>
<p>The main task for the oral preparation phase is to form a bolus
    (lump of food) suitable for swallowing, and placing it according
    to the stage of the process. This involves chewing and a
    thorough mixing of the food with <a href="/help/oral-food/saliva-and-eating">saliva</a>.
    Chewing in itself is quite an engineering achievement, making
    use of all the many subtle (and not so subtle) anatomical
    features of the jaws, teeth, tongue, facial muscles and several
    of the cranial nerves. For example, sensory controls avoid
    injury by biting oneself.</p>
<p>At this stage we also can talk without danger of choking on the
    food. In particular the occlusion of teeth in the upper and
    lower jaws is a fascinating construction, allowing for cyclical
    chewing movements that continue until the bolus is accepted
    (by receptors) as ready to move on. Figure 1 gives a brief
    and much simplified summary of the oral preparation stage
    and how the chewed food is moved around the mouth for proper
    bolus formation.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The main control features during
        the oral preparation phase in forming and placing a bolus.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Olfaction (the smelling of food) plays an important role toward
    the end of this phase: this sensory information is forwarded
    via the (nasal) receptors to the control loop that eventually
    triggers (or prevents) the swallowing reflex. The duration
    of the oral preparation phase varies strongly amongst individuals,
    but there seem to be some common patterns of particle size
    of certain foods after chewing and before swallowing.</p>
<p>During <strong>the oral phase</strong> the bolus is transported
    from the mouth to the oropharynx (area at the back of the
    mouth below the soft palate and connecting to the upper part
    of the throat), as is symbolised in Figure 2 and Figure 3.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> The travel space of the food bolus
        before the swallowing reflex is initiated.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The oral phase is under voluntary control; it starts with a range
    of motions of the tongue which essentially pull the bolus
    along the centre of the tongue from the front and middle
    of the mouth to the back. This transport motion is enabled
    by the successive actions of a whole range of muscle groups
    placed alongside and at the bottom of the tongue (see Figure
    3 for a much simplified cartoon version of the bolus transport).
    This transport motion of the bolus is supported by a closed
    mouth. The oral phase ends with triggering the swallowing
    reflex when the bolus reaches the trigger area at the back
    of the tongue / mouth.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-swallowing-anatomy-physiology-level2-figure3.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The tongue enables the transport
        of the bolus toward the oropharynx where, at the end
        of the oral phase, the swallowing reflex is triggered.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During <strong>the pharyngeal phase</strong> the transport /
    backward motion of the tongue helps to push the bolus into
    the hypopharynx (the lower part of the pharynx; the pharynx
    is the passage leading from the oral cavity to the larynx
    (voice box) and connecting to the oesophagus (gullet); air
    passes through the pharynx on the way to the lungs, food
    passes through the pharynx on the way to the oesophagus).
    This bolus transport requires the concerted (and powerful)
    action of a number of muscles and nerves.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows a cartoon version of this stage of the swallowing
    process; the sketch highlights the need to protect the nasal
    cavity and the airway from food entering them. The soft palate
    is pushed back and blocks off the nasal cavity, the airway
    is protected from food entering by a series of blocking steps
    by epiglottis (a flap of cartilage and mucosa, at the back
    of the tongue) and larynx. During the swallowing passage
    at this stage, there is a reflex triggered which stops breathing
    during this stage; the entire pharyngeal phase lasts for
    up to a second.</p>

    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The journey of the bolus immediately
        after triggering of the swallowing reflex. Nasal cavity
        and airway must be protected at this stage.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The swallowing reflex is involuntary (it is tactile but thermal
    stimuli such as cold foods can help with muscle tone). Solid
    and semi-solid foods are being swallowed in cascades, it
    is thought that a volume of about 5 ml (content of a teaspoon)
    is the most comfortable volume to swallow. The end of the
    pharyngeal phase is marked by the opening of the upper part
    of the oesophagus.</p>
<p><strong>The oesophageal phase</strong> is completely under involuntary
    control. Transport of the food bolus through the approximately
    25 cm long elastic muscle tube making up the oesophagus occurs
    in peristaltic waves. Figure 5 shows a sketch of this stage.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-food-swallowing-anatomy-physiology-level2-figure5.png">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> The oesophageal phase of the swallowing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The initial transport wave takes several seconds (between 4 s
    and 40 s) for the bolus to travel to the stomach. A secondary
    wave is initiated mechanically by left-over food particles
    sticking to the wall of the oesophagus, essentially for cleaning
    up the passage way. The oesophagus maintains a high longitudinal
    muscle tone so that, in principle, we can swallow when in
    a headstand. However, in an upright position gravity helps
    with the bolus transport.</p>
<p><strong>Swallowing liquids</strong> is a challenging task. An
    old-fashioned but perfectly valid definition of a liquid
    is that it will fill any cavity it can reach, here the oral
    cavity when we take a sip of a liquid. Swallowing a liquid
    is a rapid and direct passage, usually omitting the oral
    phase, which may only take a fraction of a second for the
    initial stages, overall less than a second to reach the stomach.
    This speed of events, together with the space-filling properties
    of liquids make it more difficult to swallow liquids safely.
    These considerations about the swallowing of liquids include
    saliva (of which we produce an estimated amount of 0.75 to
    1.5 l daily)!</p>
<h1 id="development-of-swallowing-abilities">Development of swallowing abilities</h1>
<p>Safe swallowing of a whole range of foods of mixed textures and
    temperatures is an ability which our body has to learn as
    it grows and develops, similar to having to learn how to
    walk, or talk. Sadly, for a variety of reasons our bodies
    also tend to unlearn the ability of competent swallowing
    when we get old and frail - <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia</a>    of some sort is a common, and often neglected, problem for
    many elderly people.</p>
<p>The very first, primitive swallowing attempts of a foetus can
    be observed around week 12 of pregnancy and it takes until
    approximately 4 years of age to develop competent swallowing
    abilities. The development starts in week 3 of pregnancy
    with the formation of a primitive mouth; followed by early
    embryonal structures that later on form face, nose, mouth,
    larynx and pharynx. From around week 10 the glottis (opening
    between vocal cords in the larynx) is open, from weeks 13
    - 15 the foetus starts some early form of pharyngeal swallowing
    process where the motions of lips, mouth, pharynx and oesophagus
    are distinct from each other. Weeks 17 – 20 see some early
    practice of the foetus to suck, followed by the development
    of reflexes such as biting or choking. At this stage, the
    foetus stimulates the mouth and swallows up to 400 ml of
    amniotic fluid daily. From around week 32 of pregnancy, the
    foetus can suck and swallow so that babies born at this stage
    of pregnancy can be either breast or bottle fed.</p>
<p>After birth the sequential sucking-swallowing process is established,
    together with coughing and choking reflexes and some early
    primitive hand-to-mouth coordination. Early primitive reflexes
    get replaced by more refined motor and orofacial skills over
    the first year (as the brain develops). The anatomical oral
    proportions of a newly born are different from those of an
    adult. In a young baby the palate, without teeth, is flatter
    than in an adult and the airway and oesophagus are better
    separated from each other. That allows babies to breath without
    aspiration while they are sucking, it is only during swallowing
    they have to stop breathing (triggered by a reflex) like
    an adult.</p>
<p>At 2 months old, a baby learns to control their head position,
    alongside spontaneous mouth opening and closing of the lips.
    At 3 months old, the neck flexion improves; at 4 months old
    lip and tongue control have reached a developmental stage
    such that feeding is possible (this is in parallel to developing
    control over using the arms).</p>
<p>At 5 - 7 months old, overall body control and motor skills improve
    and for most infants drinking from a cup is possible, as
    is eating of soft foods, and the early choking reflex is
    reduced over time. At 7 - 9 months old, most infants are
    able to sit properly and support their torso; well-coordinated
    movements of tongue, lip and chewing have been learned at
    this stage. At 10 - 12 months old, the hand and finger coordination
    is a little more refined (pincer grip) and eating with fingers,
    biting and some controlled chewing are established and need
    practising.</p>
<p>Learning to walk and further improving manual motor skills at
    age 13 - 18 months is a parallel development with learning
    to talk and to eat foods of all consistencies and textures.
    At 19 - 24 months old most infants learn to eat independently
    with a spoon and to drink from a cup with properly closed
    lips.</p>
<p>It takes all the time from 24 - 48 months of age to further improve
    the various body motor skills (such as jumping, using scissors,
    and so on) as well as becoming fluent with feeding independently
    (if messily…) and competent at safely swallowing all kinds
    of foods.</p>
<p>Diagnostic methods, such as <a href="/diagnosis/tests/mri/detailed">real-time MRI</a>    investigations, are important for the <a href="/help/salt">identification and assessment of swallowing disorders</a>,
    especially because there are so many different such <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">dysphagia conditions</a>.
    Figure 6 and Figure 7 give an example by comparing the swallowing
    process of thickened pineapple juice in a healthy person
    (Figure 6) with the swallowing process in a person suffering
    from a degenerative muscle-wasting condition, IBM (Figure
    7).</p>
