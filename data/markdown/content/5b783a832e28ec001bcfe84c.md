<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the hypopharynx
    (bottom part of the throat) include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Variations on the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/dysphagia">inability to swallow</a>,
        including risk of aspiration pneumonia. Supportive treatment
        by <a href="/help/salt">speech and language therapy, SALT</a>        can help.</li>
    <li>Extreme weight loss and dehydration. This may require temporary
        or permanent, complete or partial, supplemental feeding
        with (some variety of) a <a href="/help/non-oral-food">feeding tube</a>.</li>
</ul>
