<p>Treatments for postoperative problems affecting the back of the
    neck include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scars may require <a href="/treatment/surgery/facial-appearance">revision</a>,
        in some cases this may include <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive surgery techniques</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/getting-started">Altered sensation</a>        resulting from manipulation of sensory nerves in the
        region may benefit from the same <a href="/treatment/surgery/neuropathies">treatment schemes as for other nerve damage</a>.</li>
    <li>Stiffness caused by removal or manipulation of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/neuropathies/detailed">motor nerve</a>        to the <a href="/diagnosis/anatomy">muscles of the neck</a>        (trapezius and sternomastoid) can be improved by physiotherapy,
        including <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/scar-massage">scar massage</a>        and <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/shoulder">exercises to strengthen the shoulder region</a>.</li>
    <li>Worsened minor arthritic changes resulting from hyperextension
        of the neck to facilitate operation or <a href="/treatment/surgery/anaesthesia/more-info">intubation</a>        can be improved by <a href="/help/physiotherapy/videos/shoulder">physiotherapeutic exercises</a>.</li>
</ul>
