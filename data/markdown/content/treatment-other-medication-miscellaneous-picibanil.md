<p>Picibanil is a freeze-dried (lyophilised) preparation of cultures
    of a low-virulence strand of <i>streptococcus pyogenes</i>    bacteria. The initial stage of the preparation includes treatment
    of the culture with <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">penicillin</a>    to kill the bacteria. Consequently, picibanil preparations
    are not a suitable medicinal drug for those who are allergic
    to penicillin.</p>
<p>Picibanil was first developed in Japan, some 40 years ago, in
    some early attempts to develop <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/immunotherapies">immunotherapies</a>    for the treatment of malignancies. Picibanil indeed acts
    as a non-specific stimulant of the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">immune system</a>,
    including stimulation of the activity <a href="/treatment/other/new-developments/immunotherapies/more-info">of natural killer cells, macrophages and lymphocytes</a>.
    For example, it has been used as adjuvant (supportive) medication
    in conventional <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>    and its multiple interactions with the immune system continue
    to be researched. However, picibanil has never become an
    established immunotherapy drug in oncological treatments.</p>
<p>In addition to its immunostimulant properties, picibanil also
    acts as a sclerosing agent. This is its most significant
    use in maxillofacial surgery. It is an effective and selective
    agent in inducing the shrinkage of a certain type of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cyst">cysts</a>    and the treatment is generally well tolerated. In this capacity,
    picibanil has become an established agent for the treatment
    of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/vascular-abnormalities">congenital lymphatic malformations</a>,
    such as <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">lymphangioma</a>    in the head and neck region (the most common location). Both
    <a href="/treatment/surgery/cyst/more-info">surgical removal of these cystic lesions</a>    (the traditional first-line treatment) and sclerotherapy
    with picibanil have the best success in treating macrocystic
    (one large cyst) lesions, whereas the treatment of microcystic
    (multiple small cysts) lesions is more demanding surgically
    and has lower success rates with picibanil treatment. In
    the oral and maxillofacial region, picibanil sclerotherapy
    may sometimes be the preferable approach, when surgical interventions
    may lead to more severe functional and/or cosmetic deficiencies.
    Furthermore, initial picibanil treatment does not seem to
    have any adverse influence on subsequent surgical interventions.</p>
<p>Picibanil treatment typically involves needle aspiration of most
    of the fluid content from the cystic cavity and replacing
    it with picibanil solution injected into the lesion. There
    seems to be no standard procedure for the application of
    picibanil for this purpose, but this appears to be the most
    common method. Owing to its immunostimulant properties, picibanil
    typically triggers a swift, short-term local immune response
    in the form of tissue swelling. If the injected area is near
    the airway (for example, lesions located in the floor of
    the mouth or the oro-pharynx), precautions to <a href="/treatment/surgery/fracture/more-info">protect the airway</a>    have to be kept in mind. It may also be argued that, if the
    airway is likely to be compromised, this would be an indication
    to secure the airway and to surgically remove the cyst.</p>
<p>Surgical removal of these lymphatic malformations and picibanil
    sclerotherapy have similar recurrence rates. Other sclerosing
    agents that are widely used in the treatment of, for example,
    varicose veins are not effective in the treatment of lymphangioma.</p>
