<p>Below we discuss several aspects of oral hygiene, many of which
    touch on the theme of how best to help oneself and to best
    look after oneself. Some practical aspects, such as tooth
    brushing technique, are also demonstrated in <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">video clips</a>.</p>

<h1 id="plaque">Plaque</h1>
<p>Dental plaque is just one example of a natural biofilm. A biofilm
    can be described as a community of micro-organisms attached
    to a surface. These cells cannot be removed by simple rinsing
    (they are irreversibly associated) and are spatially organised
    into a three-dimensional structure enclosed in a matrix of
    extracellular material. Biofilms may form on a wide variety
    of surfaces, including indwelling medical devices, water
    system piping, natural aquatic systems and living tissues
    in general. Each biofilm is unique, with some universal structural
    attributes.</p>
<p>The dental plaque biofilm is unique to the oral cavity and enamel
    surfaces of teeth. It is comprised of over 700 known different
    bacterial species and more are yet to be characterised. Within
    this biofilm the bacteria are able to interact, communicate
    and gain benefits from each other. This degree of organisation
    makes a biofilm resilient and difficult to manage. It also
    increases its virulence. Bacteria from the aerobic <i>streptococci genus</i>    are commonly found. Anaerobic bacteria such as <i>fusiform</i>    and <i>spirochete species</i> are found in deeper layers
    of plaque and can have more pathogenic affects. Fungi, such
    as <i>candida albicans</i> and viruses, such as <i>herpes simplex</i>    are also found in <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">plaque</a>.</p>
<p>The matrix in which these microorganisms are held provides an
    abundant food source for the bacteria. The matrix is formed
    from proteins and carbohydrates (from food debris), dead
    cells, blood cells, lactic acid, mineral salts and enzymes,
    and toxins produced by the bacteria.</p>
<p>Plaque biofilm is present on virtually all tooth surfaces. It
    begins to reform gradually approximately 60 minutes after
    cleaning. Following an initial binding of bacteria to the
    surface of a tooth, the thickness of plaque will increase
    as more bacteria bind and grow. This is a natural process
    and is actually part of the body’s host defences. However,
    plaque can accumulate to levels that are not compatible with
    health, predisposing sites to oral diseases, mainly <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a>    and <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal disease (gum disease)</a>.</p>
<p>Periodontal disease, in particular, is also known to have effects
    on systemic health, due to the <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">infectious (bacterial)</a>    and <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">inflammatory</a>    nature of the disease. Links between periodontal disease
    and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes
    and respiratory disease have long been established. More
    recently, an association between periodontal disease and
    Alzheimer’s disease has been suggested, and research into
    other conditions continues. There are a number of different
    mechanisms by which oral and systemic diseases are thought
    to be linked.</p>
<p>Bacteria at the tooth / gingiva interface are able to enter the
    periodontal tissues and may elicit a transient bacteraemia
    (presence of bacteria in blood). This is more likely to occur
    for severe and ulcerated periodontitis. In such cases, simple
    day to day tasks like chewing and brushing teeth, or having
    dental treatment can cause bacteraemia. Usually the bacteria
    are eliminated quickly, however if they are able to find
    favourable conditions they may multiply (<a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">actinomycosis</a>    is an example where commensal (friendly) bacteria of the
    oral flora invade deeper tissues and cause chronic infection).
    Having bacteria ‘where they shouldn’t be’ is generally detrimental
    to health.</p>
<p>Another mechanism by which systemic health is thought to be affected
    is by inflammatory injury by the body’s <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">innate immune system</a>.
    When bacteria initiate a local response at the gingival crevice
    (narrow gap between the crown of a tooth and the gum), this
    initiates a wider systemic response. Bacteria can also release
    toxins which, once in the circulatory system, can induce
    <a href="/treatment/other/bleeding/detailed">vascular pathology</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">adaptive immune system</a>    can also be affected. Persistence of inflammation both at
    the gingiva and deeper in the periodontal tissues leads to
    B cell and T cell activation (these types of white blood
    cells are part of the body’s targeted defence response to
    specific infectious agents). These processes contribute to
    further periodontal tissue destruction and eventually can
    lead to systemic inflammatory conditions such as some forms
    of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>It is said that if one stretched out all the subgingival tissues
    in the mouth, it would cover the area of the palm of the
    hand. Having ulcerated, chronically inflamed tissue of such
    an extent on the leg or arm would surely not be ignored.
    It is important not to ignore periodontal problems, just
    because they cannot be seen or may not cause serious symptoms
    early on.</p>
<p>Regular cleaning of teeth for plaque removal limits the chance
    of these plaque-related diseases occurring. Mechanical removal,
    brushing, is the only true way of removing this build-up
    of plaque by disrupting the maturation of the bacterial community
    from forming the plaque deposits.</p>
<p>Within minutes of brushing, the salivary pellicle, a <a href="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-saliva-and-teeth-mucosa-level3">thin protective layer of saliva</a>    covering dental surfaces, is created by the various salivary
    proteins. This protective layer acts as a receptor for early
    bacterial colonisation. At this stage, the connections are
    weak and can very easily be interrupted.</p>
<p>If left alone, the initial colonising bacteria begin to produce
    substances which anchor them more firmly to the pellicle.
    This increases the adhesive properties of plaque, making
    it harder to remove.</p>
<p>As the process continues, the bacterial colonies begin to produce
    CO<sub>2</sub> and to excrete waste products. This makes
    the environment more attractive to <a href="/diagnosis/tests/microbiology">anaerobic and Gram-negative species of bacteria</a>.
    At this point the plaque is even thicker and denser, making
    it increasingly more difficult to remove. As further thickening
    occurs some bacteria may die or even break off, forming new
    colonies at other sites. Bacteria continue to reproduce and
    the cycle continues.</p>
<p>This is the reason why so much focus is placed on tooth brushing
    and interdental cleaning (see below).</p>
<p>Tooth brushing targets the removal of plaque from the gingival
    (gum) margin, pits and fissures of the teeth as well as the
    smooth surfaces. Interdental cleaning targets the proximal
    areas, the tooth surfaces between teeth (Figure 1). The gingival
    margin, pits, fissures and proximal areas, are all stagnation
    areas for plaque, and are common areas for <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental decay</a>    and <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/periodontal-disease">periodontal disease</a>    to develop.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure1.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Areas of teeth. Left: pits and
        fissures; right: gingival (gum) margins and smooth surfaces.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In its initial stages, plaque cannot be seen by the naked eye
    due to its microscopic nature. As plaque thickens, it may
    be seen as sticky, white to yellow deposits. It can be felt
    by the tongue and is often described as a ‘fuzzy’ or ‘furry’
    texture. Use of a ‘disclosing’ solution or tablet can make
    identification of plaque easier and can be used at home to
    aid better cleaning. The substances (food dyes) stain plaque,
    allowing easier identification of plaque before and after
    brushing (Figure 2). Children tend to be fascinated, and
    motivated, by the colourful ‘before’ and ‘after’ effect.</p>

<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>
<p>There is a bewildering choice of tools available for all kinds
    of oral hygiene purposes. Fortunately, this also includes
    some specialised tools for times when brushing teeth may
    be difficult.</p>
<h2>Brushes</h2>
<p>Brushing of teeth and gums can be undertaken with a manual toothbrush
    or electric toothbrush. In some instances, it may not be
    possible to brush due to pain or restricted access (for example,
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus</a> (difficulty
    opening the mouth) can make tooth brushing difficult or impossible).
     </p>
<p><strong>Electric toothbrushes</strong> may be more effective
    at removing plaque than a manual toothbrush; there is an
    ongoing debate about this. There are different types of electric
    toothbrushes available and the technique for each is slightly
    different.</p>
<p>Ideally an electric toothbrush should be rechargeable. The two
    main types are oscillating/rotary and sonic. Neither type
    is superior, therefore the user should pick a brush which
    suits best, with which they feel confident and comfortable
    with, including consideration of cost and ‘features’.</p>
<p>With an oscillating/rotary brush the head of the brush moves.
    These heads are mostly round in shape and so can fit around
    the shape of the tooth well to remove plaque. In sonic brushes,
    the head does not move but vibrates at a very high rate.
    With both types no scrubbing / brushing motion is required
    from the user.</p>
<p><strong>Manual toothbrushes</strong> come in all manner of shapes,
    sizes and hardness of bristles (Figure 3). Many commonly
    available brushes have large heads but the most widely recommended
    and easy to use would be a brush with a compact / small head.
    This allows the brush to get around teeth more precisely
    and easily. A medium firmness is generally recommended, but
    for many people a soft or very soft brush is the preferable
    choice.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure3.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> A selection of manual and electric
        tooth brushes; all with suitably small heads.  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Manual toothbrushes can come with wider, chunkier handles if
    dexterity is an issue. A regular toothbrush can also be altered
    for better grip. For example a sponge ball can be placed
    around the brush handle. Or a dental professional could use
    putty to mould to the individual’s hand for a personalised
    grip (Figure 4). Electric toothbrushes often have a larger
    chunkier handle and as no brushing motion is required from
    the user, might be the best option for those who struggle
    with manual tooth brushing.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure4.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Some modified / special tooth
        brushes. Left: a ‘superbrush’ with arrangement of bristles
        such that all tooth surfaces get brushed simultaneously;
        middle and right: tooth brushes with chunky handles (a
        DIY tip:  it is easy to modify a normal tooth-brush handle
        with a sponge ball or a tennis ball).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All tooth brushing should employ a systematic approach. This
    allows all tooth surfaces to be attended to. The buccal surfaces
    (facing out), the palatal &amp; lingual surfaces (facing
    into the palate and tongue) and occlusal surfaces (the biting
    surfaces) must all be brushed. Brushing should take at least
    two minutes. Many electric brushes have timers to help manage
    this. Manual brushes and the heads of electric brushes should
    be replaced regularly, approximately every three months.
    A good test is to turn the brush head away and if the bristles
    can be seen splaying out then it is definitely time to change
    the brush as it is no longer effective (Figure 5).</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure5.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> An example of worn &amp; torn
        manual and electric tooth brushes, ready to be retired.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Below we recap briefly the basic brushing techniques for manual
    and electric toothbrushes. The techniques are also <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">demonstrated in videos</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rotary technique – When brushing the buccal &amp; palatal
        / lingual surfaces, the brush should be angled so that
        the gingival margins are included. Each tooth should
        be brushed individually, a cupping motion around the
        tooth is advised. Brushing is completed by running the
        brush gently over the occlusal (biting) surfaces. No
        brushing motion is required from the user.</li>
    <li>Sonic technique – This is similar to a normal manual brushing
        technique. The brush is placed at a 45 ⁰ angle towards
        the gum margin when brushing the buccal and lingual /
        palatal surfaces. A slow approach moving along the margin,
        again, with no brushing motion is followed. Brushing
        is completed by running the brush gently over the occlusal
        surfaces.</li>
    <li>Manual technique – The brush is angled again at a 45 ⁰ angle
        towards the gum margin for the buccal and lingual / palatal
        surfaces. A gentle circular motion or short horizontal,
        gentle scrubbing, motion is used to remove plaque. Then
        the occlusal surfaces are also brushed. It is important
        not to apply too much force as this can wear gums away
        or cut into teeth over time. Brushing ‘from the wrist’
        rather than ‘from the elbow’ allows for a more gentle
        approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interdental cleaning aids</h2>
<p>As with toothbrushes, there are many types of interdental cleaning
    aids. A common misconception is that these aids are used
    to remove food debris (like a toothpick would). However,
    the purpose of interdental cleaning is to clear plaque from
    the spaces between teeth. Tooth brushing alone does not reach
    these spaces and without interdental cleaning approximately
    40 % of the tooth surface will remain uncleaned.</p>
<p>It is important that every user finds something that works for
    them. If it is difficult and frustrating, it is less likely
    to be used. It is recommended to undertake interdental cleaning
    at least once per day before brushing so that any debris
    or plaque dislodged is swiftly removed by subsequent tooth
    brushing. Toothpaste does not need to be used, but a dental
    professional may recommend using a fluoride or antibacterial
    <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a>    gel if required.</p>
<p>When interdental cleaning is taken up, it is likely that the
    gums will bleed. This bleeding is not due to damage or trauma,
    if the cleaning has been carried out correctly, but due to
    inflammation in these areas. It is common to experience some
    bleeding at first, but with regular, well performed interdental
    cleaning each day bleeding should reduce and stop over a
    couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Interdental brushes</strong> come in different sizes,
    size is normally indicated by a colour, and colours change
    depending on the brand. Handle styles are also different
    according to brand (Figure 6).</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure6.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 6:</strong> A selection of interdental brushes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If gripping the brush is difficult, a long-handled or wider-handled
    interdental brush may be best. If one is struggling to reach
    difficult areas at the back of the mouth, a long-handled
    brush may be more effective.</p>
<p>The brush used should fill the interdental space for the best
    level of plaque removal, it should not snag or stick. A smooth
    motion when placing in and removing is ideal. Different areas
    may require different sizes of interdental brushes.</p>
<p>The gums are not flat, on the upper jaw they slope down gently
    and slope up for the lower jaw. The interdental brush should
    be placed in the space following this incline. Once in place,
    the brush should be gently moved so that it cleans each tooth,
    and then gently removed. Bending the brush can help it to
    be sturdier, especially for posterior teeth. Being gentle
    is also key, as a rushed forceful approach may add to the
    risk of the brush curling and bending. The technique for
    interdental cleaning is also <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">demonstrated in videos</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rubber tips</strong> also come in different varieties,
    they are used in the same way as interdental brushes (Figure
    7). Some people find rubber tips easier to use as they do
    not bend as much and may be easier to access tight spaces.
    Although not as effective as brushes, rubber tips might offer
    a ‘good enough’ alternative.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure7.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Rubber tips as an alternative
        for interdental cleaning.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Floss</strong> may be for some areas the only interdental-cleaning
    option, or it may be the generally preferred option (Figure
    8). It must be used safely and correctly to be effective.
    Traditional floss can be quite bulky, so a floss tape is
    better advised. Floss can be used wrapped around the fingers
    or ‘flossettes’ are available which provide a handle for
    easier management. This handle can be short or longer, like
    a toothbrush handle.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure8.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Floss, floss tape and flossettes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Floss should be introduced from the top of the tooth, through
    and down into the interdental space. This should be a gentle
    motion. Once in this space, the floss is brought against
    each tooth. It is often described as making a ‘c-shape’ or
    ‘hugging into’ the tooth. It is then gently removed. No ‘see-sawing’
    motion is necessary, a simple gentle removal of plaque is
    all that is required.</p>
<p>Superfloss (Figure 9) is a special type of floss which can be
    used around bridge work. It has a thinner ‘threading end’
    and a thicker floss attached to it.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure9.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Superfloss.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The thinner end is threaded in an area to allow access for the
    floss to pass underneath the bridge work to remove debris
    and plaque. It should not be used for regular interdental
    spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Air &amp; water flossing</strong> is becoming increasingly
    common. A flossing unit is used with a tip that is placed
    into the interdental space and water and/or air is used at
    high pressure to mechanically remove plaque / debris. Some
    people may find it easier (and easier to control) to use
    a plastic syringe for exactly the same purpose, especially
    when mouth opening is limited.</p>
<h1 id="toothpastes-and-mouthwashes">Toothpastes and mouthwashes</h1>
<h2>Toothpastes</h2>
<p>A toothpaste containing fluoride is recommended for everyone.
    Fluoride has a role in the prevention of dental decay. There
    are several ways in which it is believed that fluoride ions
    take on this protective role. Fluoride ions promote the remineralisation
    of tooth enamel in areas where the tooth may have already
    begun a process of demineralisation. Fluoride ions also work
    to convert hydroxyapatite (the calcium mineral found in enamel)
    into fluoroapatite which is less soluble in acids created
    in the <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">development of caries</a>.</p>
<p>A pea sized amount of toothpaste should be used when brushing.
    It is important to spit out after brushing but not to rinse
    the mouth. Rinsing means the fluoride is washed away not
    allowing for any benefit to the tooth tissues. The highest
    amount of fluoride possible should be used. In shops, the
    highest amount of fluoride ions in toothpaste available is
    1450 parts per million (ppm). Information about the fluoride
    content can be found in the list of ingredients on a toothpaste
    tube.</p>
<p>Sometimes a toothpaste with an even higher amount of fluoride
    is appropriate. This is the case when there is an increased
    risk of dental decay, for example for people afflicted by
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia (dry mouth)</a>    or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">trismus (difficulty opening the mouth)</a>.
    High fluoride-content toothpaste may also be used as a precaution
    in the daily oral hygiene management following <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    of the head and neck region. These types of toothpastes need
    to be prescribed by a dentist or doctor.</p>
<p>Sometimes toothpastes can be uncomfortable to use if the oral
    tissues are particularly dry or sensitive following treatment.
    Strong mint flavours can give a burning sensation to the
    mouth. This is unpleasant and may deter someone from continuing
    with a regular tooth-brushing regime. Using a flavourless
    or mildly flavoured toothpaste can help with this. It may
    also be preferable to use a toothpaste free of sodium lauryl
    sulfate. Sodium lauryl sulfate is added to many products,
    not just toothpastes. It is a detergent and foaming agent
    and can act as an irritant (or even allergen), and can exacerbate
    dry-mouth problems. Toothpastes free of sodium lauryl sulfate
    are available, checking the list of ingredients on the toothpaste
    package will provide this information.</p>
<p>Some people choose to use a variety of whitening toothpastes
    (including the latest hype in black toothpastes, containing
    carbon black as the active ingredient). However, there is
    no evidence that they actually whiten teeth. These toothpastes
    tend to be very abrasive which is not good for teeth and
    should be avoided.</p>
<h2>Mouthwashes</h2>
<p>Using a mouthwash should never be thought of as a replacement
    for good daily tooth brushing, but it may have its place
    for some individuals at specific times and circumstances.
    If a mouthwash is being used in addition to brushing, it
    should be used at a different time to brushing as not to
    wash away fluoride from toothpaste.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">Chlorohexidine</a>    mouthwashes are often advised following oral surgery to help
    inhibit plaque growth and for its antimicrobial properties.
    It is not recommended for long term use but may be used as
    an adjunct to brushing when the risk of infection is high
    or when brushing is simply not possible.</p>
<p>Chlorohexidine can cause staining of the teeth and ideally should
    not be used for more than two weeks at a time, where possible.
    An alcohol-free preparation should be used as alcohol-containing
    preparations can dry the oral tissues. Chlorhexidine mouthwashes
    can be quite harsh on oral tissues, so are not recommended
    for patients with <a href="/diagnosis-list-oral-mucosla-lesion-level3">oral mucositis</a>    as a common adverse effects of <a href="/treatment/chemotherapy">chemo-</a>    and/or <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>    in the treatment of <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">head and neck malignancies</a>    or other malignancies such as <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/tumour/blood-malignancy">lymphoma or leukaemia</a>,
    or when suffering from <a href="/">other oral mucosal lesions</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, saline rinse can be used if oral tissues feel sensitive.
    Some studies have shown that this can improve physical and
    social-emotional quality of life measures for people experiencing
    painful oral mucositis. Saline solutions can be made at home
    from salt mixed with boiling water and left to cool. Professionals
    may also provide ready-made saline solutions as mouth rinses.
    Also saline mouth rinses should be used at a different time
    to brushing teeth, to allow for full protective effect of
    fluoride in toothpaste (if using toothpaste at the time).</p>
<p>A fluoride-containing mouthwash used at a different time from
    brushing can add a fluoride boost throughout the day. Having
    this extra exposure of fluoride to the teeth can be helpful
    in a preventative approach to <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/decay">dental caries</a>.
    Often these mouthwashes can be quite strong in flavour so
    should be used with caution. It is also advisable to check
    that the mouthwash chosen is an alcohol-free preparation.</p>
<h1 id="oral-hygiene-in-difficult-circumstances">Oral hygiene in difficult circumstances</h1>
<p>Motivation to achieve good oral hygiene can be a struggle for
    anyone at times. During and after treatment for <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer">oral cancer</a>,
    be it <a href="/treatment/surgery/cancer">surgical</a> and
    / or <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> modalities,
    the motivation to do anything may slip. It is, however, enormously
    helpful in many regards to be kind with oneself and help
    oneself by trying to maintain good oral hygiene standards
    – it is a major contribution toward optimal outcomes. Tools
    and ‘tricks of the trade’ exist to deal with difficult and
    unconventional situations, some of which we describe below.</p>
<h2>Pain</h2>
<p>Pain when undertaking oral hygiene practices is common, especially
    after oral surgery, when <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion/detailed">mucositis</a>    occurs during chemo- and/or radiotherapy, when there is
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infection</a>, or after trauma. It is important to employ
        common sense in these situations. Removal of plaque is
        important and can reduce the chance of further problems
        developing. However, conventional oral-hygiene approaches
        at such times may not be appropriate and in fact may
        be harmful both physically and also psychologically.
        A bad experience can deter one from trying again (similar
        arguments about avoiding disappointment and frustration
        apply to eating and avoiding <a href="/help/oral-food/practical-tips">former favourite foods</a>        until one is fully fit to enjoy them again).</p>
<p>Using a soft or super-soft toothbrush is advised. Failing this,
    moist gauze or even cotton buds or swabs can be used to remove
    plaque that is accumulating (Figure 10). Sweeping them along
    the gum margin gently, where it is possible, is best. It
    may be that some areas of the mouth are more tolerable then
    others. It is fine if the whole mouth cannot be cleaned as
    at normal times. This is a realistic and pragmatic approach,
    and ‘normal’ practices can be resumed gradually and as soon
    as possible.</p>

        ‘lollipop’; bottom left: cotton buds (in many varieties);
        bottom right: gauze that can be wrapped around a finger.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The intensity of mint flavours in toothpastes and mouthwashes
    (see above) can induce pain and discomfort. Using a sodium
    lauryl sulfate free (see above), non-flavoured toothpaste
    may also help. At times it may not be possible to use any
    toothpaste.</p>
<p>If mechanical removal of plaque by brushing is (temporarily)
    impossible, a mouthwash may be more tolerable. Although mouthwash
    will not remove the plaque, some mouthwashes at least inhibit
    the growths of bacterial colonies (bacteriostatic effect).
    Alcohol-free <a href="/treatment/other/medication/miscellaneous/chlorhexidine">chlorhexidine</a>    mouthwash, including non-staining preparations, has such
    properties.</p>
<p>Some days it may not be possible to remove plaque with any of
    the methods. This is normal and no reason to despair. Establishing
    a good oral hygiene regime as soon as possible, but only
    when ready is completely acceptable and follows the wisdom
    of common sense.</p>
<h2>Difficult access / trismus</h2>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/trismus">Trismus</a> can present many
    difficulties and frustrations, and make ‘normal’ oral hygiene
    practices feel incredibly difficult. It is important to think
    ‘outside the box’ at these times. It is unlikely that thorough
    brushing in all areas of the mouth will be possible, but
    trying to complete as much as possible cannot be stressed
    enough.</p>
<p>Completing some sort of oral hygiene regime is still of the utmost
    importance as prevention is key. People suffering from trismus
    may be at a higher risk of dental decay due to a <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">liquid diet</a>.
    Trismus also makes <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry">restorative dental</a>    or <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/periodontal/detailed">periodontal treatment</a>    difficult, so preventing problems from occurring is particularly
    important.</p>
<p>As always, brushing teeth in front of a mirror is recommended
    so that one can see what us actually being done in the mouth.
    Soft tissues, such as lips and cheeks, may need to be actively
    (but gently) moved out the way to allow better access. This
    can be difficult when skin is tight, but perseverance is
    key. Asking a dental professional for a plastic dental mirror
    may be an option. It can be used to retract cheeks and lips
    to allow for better access. Using a finger to touch where
    aiming to brush, then placing the toothbrush on top of the
    finger can also help. This is particularly useful if sensation
    has been lost in some areas of the mouth.</p>
<p>A toothbrush with a small compact head (manual or electric),
    or even a child’s brush is recommended. Single tufted brushes
    may also have their place for better access for those hard
    to reach areas. For interdental cleaning long handled interdental
    brushes (see above) are available, or consideration of a
    water or air flosser might be a good alternative. Water or
    air flossers (or some plastic syringes) often have long narrow
    attachments to direct the water/air flow and thus take less
    space to fit into the mouth than a finger holding an interdental
    brush.</p>
<h2>Nil by mouth status</h2>
<p>It is a common misconception that teeth are solely brushed to
    remove food debris, this is not the case. Even when on a
    ‘nil by mouth’ diet, plaque still needs to be removed.</p>
<p>It is important to determine whether somebody has a <a href="/help/salt">‘safe swallow’</a>    when thinking about tooth brushing. This will often be discussed
    with the treating clinician or the speech and language team.
    If somebody is not able to swallow safely and there is a
    risk of aspiration, brushing teeth gently without toothpaste
    may be a good practical solution. There are also suction
    toothbrushes available which can be an aid to reduce the
    risk of aspiration. Using a non-foaming toothpaste may also
    have its place, as this can be less distressing.</p>
<h2>Fungal infection</h2>
<p><a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">Oral fungal infections</a>    are common following treatment for head and neck cancers.
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">Xerostomia</a> can make
    the mouth a breeding ground for such infections, as can struggling
    to maintain good oral hygiene, as well as having <a href="/treatment/other/medication/inflammation/more-info">lower immunity</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise the signs and symptoms of oral fungal
    infections. <i>Candida albicans</i> which gives rise to oral
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection/more-info">candidiasis or ‘oral thrush’</a>    is the most commonly seen. Unfortunately, with thrush really
    good brushing is important even though the mouth can feel
    very sore and uncomfortable. Using a very soft, small toothbrush
    and soft interdental brushes can help to remove plaque. <i>Candida</i>    may be living in the plaque film. The tongue is also an important
    area to clean as plaque can accumulate there as well, especially
    if xerostomia is an issue.</p>
<p>Using a tongue scraper can help. These devices are specifically
    designed for cleaning the tongue (Figure 11). A tongue scraper
    is placed at the back of the tongue and pulled gently forwards
    then washed under a running tap. This should be repeated
    until the tongue looks clean.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure11.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Example of a tongue scraper;
        there are many different styles available.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A toothbrush can also be used to brush the tongue. This should
    be a different toothbrush to the one used for brushing the
    teeth and gums. As with the tongue scraper, it should be
    thoroughly cleaned. Cleaning the tongue has the additional
    benefit of maximising the <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">sense of taste</a>,
    which may be compromised by the presence of thick plaque
    on the back of the tongue.</p>
<p>Dentures can be a source of fungal infection, so daily cleaning
    practices should be undertaken thoroughly (see below). If
    simple oral-hygiene practices are not helping the situation,
    it is advisable to seek advice from a dental professional
    as an <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antifungal medication</a>    may be required to treat the problem systemically as well
    as locally through excellent oral-hygiene practices.  </p>
<h2>Lone standing teeth</h2>
<p>Where teeth are lost, there will be gaps in the dentition. In
    some cases, this ends up with a lone standing tooth, a tooth
    that does not have any other teeth adjacent to it. Plaque
    adherence around a lone standing tooth can become a problem.</p>
<figure><img src="/help-selfhelp-oral-hygiene-practical-guide-level3-figure12.jpg">
    <figcaption><strong>Figure 12:</strong> Model of a lone standing tooth,
        with an interdental brush wrapped around it to demonstrate
        brushing of the surfaces.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Such teeth can be missed in the brushing routine, especially
    if they are quite far back in the mouth. There is also more
    surface for plaque to adhere too. The mesial (front) and
    distal (back) areas of these teeth may also be missed as
    a regular toothbrush does not fit well in these areas. As
    mechanical plaque removal by thorough brushing (see above)
    is the only true way to stop plaque build-up, lone standing
    teeth may require a dedicated brushing routine. Large interdental
    brushes can be very helpful for brushing these teeth when
    used on the mesial and distal surfaces, using the regular
    toothbrush for the gingival margins (Figure 12).  A single
    tufted brush can also be of use here as it is compact enough
    to be used all around the tooth.</p>
<p>Lone standing teeth, like all teeth, are important. However,
    in some instances they become even more important as they
    might be the only tooth left in certain areas of the mouth.
    Maintaining these last remaining natural teeth helps maintain
    bone levels in the jaws. Without teeth, the jaw bones resorb
    and shrink. However, having a good level of jaw bone is important
    when <a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants">prosthesis</a>    is being designed, be it dental implants, dentures or bridges.
    Beyond helping to maintain healthy jaw-bone levels, lone
    standing teeth may have an additional role in securing or
    supporting required prostheses.  </p>
<h2>Supported oral hygiene</h2>
<p>For some people it may be difficult or impossible to undertake
    daily oral hygiene practices due to mobility or dexterity
    issues. Following some surgical interventions, there may
    need for a period of recovery until arms and hands are healed.
    Other medical issues may lead to a reduction in fine motor
    movements required to perform oral hygiene effectively.</p>
<p>As oral hygiene is so important, asking for help is a good option.
    For some this may mean putting pride aside. There is no harm
    or anything to be lost in asking for some support. This might
    mean someone else is completing all of the brushing, or maybe
    just helping with difficult to reach areas.</p>
<p>When assisting with tooth brushing it is important that the head
    of the person having their teeth brushed is well supported.
    Having the person sitting rather than standing can help with
    this. The person assisting should ideally be standing behind
    the person slightly to one side. This allows for good vision
    and provision of head support. The person assisting may need
    to gently move the soft tissues, such as the lips and cheeks
    with a finger to help with access to teeth and gums. Brushing
    is in the systematic way so as no areas are missed. Using
    a non-foaming toothpaste can help the person assisting to
    see better in the mouth.</p>
<h1 id="care-of-prostheses">Care of prostheses</h1>
<h2>Dentures</h2>
<p>There are different types of dentures falling into two categories,
    full / complete and partial dentures. Different materials
    can be used to create dentures, acrylic or chrome, or some
    combination of both. Regardless of the type and material,
    dentures need to be cared for to ensure good oral health.</p>
<p>Plaque and food debris can easily accumulate on dentures. This
    harbouring of microorganisms is harmful to the soft tissues
    of the mouth and leads to a higher risk of infections such
    as <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/more-info">fungal infections by candida species</a>.
    Poor care of partial dentures can increase the risk of decay
    and periodontal problems of existing teeth.</p>
<p>Dentures should be removed every night, cleaned and stored safely
    until being put back in the following morning. Dentures should
    be cleaned ideally after every meal. Where this is not possible
    at least once daily cleaning should occur.</p>
<p>Dentures should be cleaned over a bowl or sink filled with water
    this ensures should they be dropped they will not break.
    The technique is also <a href="/help/oral-hygiene/videos">demonstrated in videos</a>.</p>
<p>All areas of the denture should be brushed with a ‘denture brush’
    or soft toothbrush. This should not be the same brush used
    for natural teeth. A denture cleaning paste or fragrance-free
    liquid soap can be applied to the brush. Regular toothpastes
    may be abrasive, so it is not recommended to use them for
    regular cleaning of dentures. After cleaning, the denture
    should be rinsed well with cold water.</p>
<p>When not in the mouth, dentures should be stored in a solid container
    to protect them. It is not recommended that dentures are
    stored in a ‘denture cleaner’ solution as these can bleach
    / wash out acrylic dentures and corrode chrome. Any use of
    denture cleaner should follow the manufacturer’s instructions
    carefully.</p>
<h2>Obturators</h2>
<p>An obturator is a form of prosthesis to seal an opening in the
    maxilla between the oral and the nasal cavity after large
    surgical resections in the maxillar region. In some circumstances,
    an obturator can be a preferable form of oral rehabilitation
    over <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">surgical reconstruction with free flaps</a>.</p>
<p>There will be different obturators at different points in the
    treatment and recovery. An initial surgical obturator will
    be placed during surgery in the operating theatre right after
    the resection. This initial obturator will stay in place
    for a couple of weeks and it is not to be removed.</p>
<p>Another temporary obturator will then be placed. This second-stage
    obturator should be cleaned much like a denture – over a
    sink to avoid breaking should it be dropped, with a toothbrush
    or denture brush and a denture paste or fragrance free toothpaste.
    All surfaces of the obturator should be brushed to ensure
    bacterial plaque and secretions are removed. This kind of
    care and cleaning regime is also required for the third-stage,
    definitive obturator. However, in addition to daily cleaning
    it is recommended that a definitive obturator is removed
    for a period of time, overnight if possible, and kept in
    a moist environment (for example in a plastic container with
    a tight-fitting lid and with a small amount of water). The
    specialist providing the obturator should be able to advise
    when the time is right to begin removing the obturator for
    these prolonged periods. If special soft linings are used,
    advice will be given on how to care for these.</p>
<p>Some people may need to clean the soft oral tissues when the
    obturator is not in place. People affected by <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">xerostomia</a>    are at a higher risk of dried secretions becoming lodged
    in and around soft tissues. These secretions can normally
    be removed with a damp brush or sponge swab. It is important
    to check these products as for some sponge swabs the sponge
    can become separated from the swab stick.</p>
<p>Care and use of an obturator is person specific and specific
    advice about the most suitable approach is best to be obtained
    from the team providing treatment.</p>
<p><a href="/treatment/restorative-dentistry/implants"><strong>Dental implants</strong></a></p>
<p>With regard to oral hygiene, dental implants need to be treated
    with the same level of care as natural teeth. Tooth brushing
    is still required as is interdental cleaning. Seeking out
    a good hygienist / dental therapist / dentist can be very
    helpful. They can give tailored, personalised advice on the
    best equipment and techniques to clean effectively.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while dental implants obviously
    cannot be affected by dental caries, they are at risk of
    periodontal problems. Periodontal problems affecting implants
    tend to progress quicker than in the natural dentition. Periodontal
    fibres do not readily form between the implant and bone.</p>
<p>Bleeding around implants is a sign of poor oral hygiene and if
    not corrected with improvement in oral-hygiene practices
    may lead to the loss of the implant. It is advisable to seek
    examination and advice from a dentist if concerned about
    bleeding around implants whilst cleaning. Regular and thorough
    examination of the implants must also take place to ensure
    any issues can be detected early.</p>
<p>It is tempting to think that implants being placed can solve
    dental problems previously experienced. This is simply not
    the case. Care of dental implants requires the same level
    of motivation, time and diligence as should be given to oral
    hygiene for natural teeth.</p>
