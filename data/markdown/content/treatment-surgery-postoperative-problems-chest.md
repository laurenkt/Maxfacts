<p>Postoperative problems affecting the chest can be remedied as
    follows</p>
<ul>
    <li>Non-surgical management of the chest, in terms of the lungs
        refers to chest <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/infection">infections</a>,
        atelectasis (partial or complete collapse of the lung),
        pneumonia, these are all part of the potential generic
        postoperative problem scenario. <a href="/help/physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</a>        to promote coughing, adequate <a href="/treatment/other/medication/pain/detailed">analgesia</a>,
        mobilisation and targeted <a href="/treatment/other/medication/infection/detailed">antibiotics / antibacterials</a>        are used.</li>
    <li>The chest, if seen as maxillofacial specific refers to the
        chest wall, which is primarily the donor site for flaps
        in <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">reconstructive maxillofacial surgery</a>.
        Pectoralis major is the main, thick superficial chest
        muscle. For purposes of <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">maxillofacial reconstructive surgery</a>,
        haematoma (accumulation of clotted blood in tissue) can
        occur underneath the remaining skin of the chest wall
        even though drains are always placed. Evacuation of haematoma
        is sometimes needed if a fresh bleed occurs or the drains
        are blocked. The scars can stretch and be unsightly and
        the female breast can be distorted. Conventional scar
        management is helpful. Some weakness in adduction (moving
        the arm inwards) of the <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems/upper-arm">arm</a>        will be noticed. <a href="/help/physiotherapy">Physiotherapy</a>        is the most useful approach.</li>
    <li>The pectoralis minor muscle is a small triangular muscle
        covered by the pectoralis major muscle. It serves as
        donor site for free flaps used in <a href="/treatment/surgery/reconstruction">facial reanimation surgery</a>.
        The donor site defects are minimal and the scar is on
        the side of the chest and doesnâ€™t spread. Any postoperative
        problems are much minor versions of that with pectoralis
        major.</li>
</ul>
