<p>Most of our discussions of treatment options for maxillofacial
    conditions include recent clinical practice, with the occasional
    hint at further developments and research at pre-clinical
    stage, or in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Not all initially promising developments will end up as accepted
    clinical practice – some drawbacks may be encountered along
    the way. On the other hand, it is not uncommon that surprise
    discoveries swiftly become adopted as standard practice:
    serendipity sometimes is a great aid for useful discoveries.
    Of slightly more concern, new gadgets and techniques have
    an innate appeal to many surgeons. In the UK there are several
    national processes to try to moderate the enthusiasm to ‘try
    out the new’.</p>
<p>In order to keep the content of this website up to date, we include
    this section about new developments. The selection is, by
    necessity, reflecting our opinions and expectations. Only
    time will tell if we were right or wrong about promising
    developments. Obviously, this section of the website will
    also need regular updates.</p>
<p>The content of this page is given in alphabetical order for convenience.</p>
