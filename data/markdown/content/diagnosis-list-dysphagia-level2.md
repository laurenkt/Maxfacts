<h1 id="causes-of-dysphagia">Causes of dysphagia</h1>
<p><a href="/help/oral-food/swallowing-anatomy-physiology">Swallowing</a>    is an incredibly complicated series of chains of commands,
    involving numerous sensors in your mouth and throat, nerves,
    muscles, glands, all following several tight feedback loops
    in order to get the chain of events right. If any one of
    these components fails, the act of swallowing will fail to
    work properly in various different ways. Because of the speed
    of events when swallowing liquids, it turns out to be a common
    challenge to swallow liquids safely. With so many different
    essential components involved, there are numerous causes
    for dysphagia.</p>
<p>Forms of dysphagia occur in many neurological conditions (such
    as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease),
    they may be caused by muscle weaknesses (such as muscular
    dystrophy), by brain injury or other trauma, by malformation
    in newly borns or by dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease).
    In the context of oral and maxillofacial conditions, dysphagia
    can occur as a symptom of injury, of disease (such as swelling
    or tumour growth preventing passage of food) or as a consequence
    of various treatments such as medication or <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/postoperative-problems">surgery</a>    or <a href="/treatment/radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> (causing
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/xerostomia">dry mouth</a> and/or
    mouth sores).</p>
<h1 id="possible-symptoms-of-dysphagia">Possible symptoms of dysphagia</h1>
<p>Given the range of causes and resulting different types of dysphagia,
    symptoms of dysphagia are also varied and cover the whole
    range of severity from minor nuisance all the way to very
    serious.</p>
<p>Possible symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unable to swallow liquids</li>
    <li>Unable to swallow solid food</li>
    <li>Over- or underactive gag reflex</li>
    <li>Unable to chew</li>
    <li>Hoarse voice after eating</li>
    <li>Swallowing the wrong way</li>
    <li>Aspiration</li>
    <li>Coughing after eating</li>
    <li>Impression of increased saliva production</li>
    <li>Much reduced food / drink intake</li>
    <li>Feeling of food stuck in throat</li>
    <li>Feeling of lump in throat</li>
    <li>Repeated need to clear throat</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="potential-consequences-and-problems">Potential consequences and problems</h1>
<p>Dysphagia which is not properly <a href="/help/salt">assessed</a>    and where no suitable steps are taken to mitigate the problems
    can lead to considerable further health issues. These include
    repeated and severe pneumonia caused by aspiration of food
    particles and/or liquid, aversion to eating/drinking (subsequently
    leading to weight loss, <a href="/help/oral-food">malnutrition and dehydration</a>    and to isolation and <a href="/help/mental-health">depression</a>),
    fear of eating due to choking.</p>
<h1 id="dealing-with-food-and-drink">Dealing with food and drink</h1>
<p>Careful assessment of your <a href="/help/salt">swallowing</a>    will give hints and ideas about <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">suitable textures and temperatures of food</a>    that you might want to try and which are safe to eat / drink.
    This may change over time and the assessment may have to
    be repeated accordingly.</p>
<p>The finer details of what you can tolerate to take by mouth require
    some more individual trial and error which, again, is likely
    to be an ongoing process as problems change over time. With
    the exception of fish and chips (for which so far nobody
    has invented a satisfactory, smooth and homogeneous jellied
    version), just about every kind of food / drink can be prepared
    at a <a href="/help/oral-food/ttt">suitable temperature and in a suitable texture</a>    for your needs. This degree of flexibility can reduce the
    need for <a href="/help/non-oral-food">alternative (tube) feeding</a>    considerably.</p>
