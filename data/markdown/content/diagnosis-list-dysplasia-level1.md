<p>The term dysplasia refers to any abnormal growth and development
    of cells, tissues and organs. In maxillofacial surgery it
    is usually used as a term relating to microscopic (small
    scale) abnormalities at the level of cells and certain clinical
    appearances within the mouth lining. Cellular abnormalities
    may include size, shape, pigmentation and maturity of dividing
    cells. Abnormalities in cell development and growth can occur
    for a number of reasons and can lead to a wide spectrum of
    degrees of dysplasia.</p>
<p>In the context of oral and maxillofacial conditions, microscopic
    abnormalities at the level of cells are relevant. Some
    <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/oral-mucosal-lesion">lesions of the oral mucosa</a> (the lining of the mouth),
        usually a variety of white, red or speckled patches,
        are associated with such cellular abnormalities. Depending
        on the type and degree of dysplasia present in such lesions,
        some such mucosal lesions have to be considered as pre-malignant
        lesions: they may have a tendency to develop into a
        <a href="/diagnosis/a-z/cancer/mouth-cancer">malignant lesion</a>. It is important to understand that
            for the clinical interpretation the word leukoplakia
            is often used implying cellular dysplasia Â but in
            terms of disease progression is pretty useless.</p>
<p>If dysplasia is found in oral mucosal lesions, by taking a
    <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy">biopsy</a> and <a href="/diagnosis/tests/biopsy/detailed">microscopic examination</a>        of the specimen, in many cases this will be a form of
        cellular abnormalities which carries a low risk of developing
        into a malignant lesion. The situation is different for
        some such lesions where there is a significant risk to
        turn into a malignant lesion if left untreated.</p>
